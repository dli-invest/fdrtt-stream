15386," I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. Well this is all money and this is me just building it's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. Multi trillion dollar industry there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg link I won't forget the major market opens and it's safe to say big focus across the region on the Yen after it hit about 149 on Friday, $1,000 stronger after inflation expectations in the U.S. Rose. Bold action promised again by Japan's government, Heidi, but this is definitely on our radar screen. Yeah, also watching trading in the pound as well, right? There's further upside potential for this recovery. If we get a further U-turn from Liz Truss on this package of unfunded cuts, cuts of course, we already had the change at the top when it comes to the Chancellor of the X-Chakras. So continuing to see FX as a key focus as we get into this Monday morning open bell. Yeah, Kathleen, Heidi, you mentioned there those moves in the pound. What's also playing out in the Treasury space, we do have the open here of Japan and South Green. We're also seeing the start of trade for cash treasuries and I'll just kick off with that based on what you were saying there, Heidi, because we had seen moves in the futures market, edging higher in early trade, really a story of what is happening in the UK because that has been learning a bit of stabilization into the guilt's market and also what we see in terms of the pound that you can look there rising in the early trading session. But as you said, Kathleen, really in Asia's day, we're very focused on the direction of the yen as it nears that key 150 level Goldman Sachs saying that we could actually get there within three months. And that's because of that ongoing divergence that we do continue to see between the US and Japan. In terms of the direction of stocks, we're seeing the NICA here sliding at the start of trade, we did have that big trading jump on the Friday session, rising more than 3% a lot of foreigners starting to come back into this market as well. Let's turn now though to the open for Korea, because we've also been hearing from local media this morning reporting that the governor says that there's one B okay board member saying that the terminal rate should be higher than 3.5%. In terms of the direction of the one at the start of trade, you can see it's weakening there quite substantially down nearly 1%. In the direction of stocks that we see as well, watching what happens in the tech index and behind, but now we're looking at investment in balance and local products as well,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3672,2022-10-17 00:04:24
15387," In terms of the direction of the one at the side of trade, you can see it's weakening there quite substantially down nearly 1%. And then the direction of stocks that we see as well, watching what happens in the tech index in particular throughout the session with these inflation and recession concerns still in focus given that University of Michigan survey over the last weekend as well. On Friday, rather saying that inflation expectations are ticking higher on a one-year basis, so negative for the tech index there. But in Australia, the other focus today is on what happens in the energy sector because if you change on now, we are seeing Brent Crude rising at the start of trade, but still it was a weekly drop. And so that's really feeding into what we're seeing in the energy index this morning. You can see that is outpacing the losses that we have for the broader ASX 200 hiding. Let's get some more when it comes to the opportunities that we're seeing across the region. Our next guest actually sees that in Chinese equities, but only for those with high risk appetite and a long-term horizon, let's bring in Vassimena, who's Executive Director of Investment Strategy at OCVC Bank World Management in Vassim. Those are some pretty strong caveats I have to say. In terms of what we heard over the weekend, what we're expecting from the party congress, has any of that changed your outlook or your strategy for China? In all honesty, we weren't looking very much from the party congress and true enough, I don't think so. If anything regarding the letter of COVID-19 or the letter in terms of housing market policies, two factors that have weighed on the economy. But going forward, I think that could change. It's not going to be a quick dramatic change. It could change the next six to nine months. I think China at some stage will have to ease up on its COVID policy. But really for it right now, perhaps when there's an MRN8 vaccine, sometimes early next year, perhaps there'll be more already. When the vaccination rates amongst the seniors in China increase further, then probably there'll be more really. But I think they'll probably move in a very gradual fashion as far as easing COVID policies concerned. That's been a big drag on the economy. But having said that, a lot of the bad news has been priced into the markets. The MSCI China has done sharply and that's the reason why we feel that the Chinese equity market is something investors should not ignore. But at the same time, not be too aggressive either because there's going to be still quite a bit of volatility, it's going to be through this party congress and other economic policies in the next six months. Because one of the other themes we're starting to see emerge is a tug of war between governments and central banks. Obviously, the UK is a prominent casualty of that battle. At least in China, do you have the advantage of being on the same page when it comes to policymaking? And hopefully being able to return to that counter-cyclical factor of resuming to some level, of course. Absolutely. I think that's China's advantage. Inflation is not running away in China and like the US, the PBC has the ability to do more if it wants to. The government has the ability to do more if it wants to. But having said all that, I think I also have a caution. What came through quite clearly from switching things, opening a dress to the battle congress is that I don't think they're looking for a return to rapid growth. Yes, the Chinese government has a 5.5% target for the economy this year. And economy is probably going to come in at just about 3% in terms of growth this year. But I don't think they're looking to achieve that 5.5% target. I think they're looking for reasonable growth. So they will not do anything that is too aggressive. And so I think it's going to be more gradual. I mean, they'll do what they can to support the economy, the housing market. Don't expect fireworks from fiscal policy or monetary policy in China. It will be gradual steps. Looking down the road, this is not an immediate investment idea or avenue. But when she vows, victory in the tech battle, you know, after the US curb. And you know that that's going to be very important to build up the chip industry. Make it competitive. Will there be opportunities for investors? Do you think China is going to follow through on this degree that that's something to keep your eye on? Well, that's something quite clearly. The government is quite determined to do. I mean, they're going to push quite aggressively and that's quite aggressively in the high technology space. I mean, the tech space in China has seen a beating. But that's really in the e-commerce space that's taken a beating. I mean, because of typing regulations over the last 12.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3673,2022-10-17 00:08:52
15388," I mean, the tech space in China has seen a beating. But that's really in the e-commerce space that's taken a beating. I mean, because of tightening regulations over the last 12, 18 months in China. But when it comes to high technology, I mean, when it comes to the chicken industry, I think the government recognizes that it is something they have to invest quite aggressively. I don't think the opportunities are already immediate. It's something to keep in mind. But it's quite clear that the Chinese government will focus on this area. They recognize the fact that there's a lot of pushback from the US. And so it's one area that prepared to put in money in the US and take on the US. And they know they have to do it to stay competitive and to keep China's status as a superpower. So, Vasa, I have to ask you about Yen. What do you think is going to happen there? Continue to weaken? Bold action from the government? Is it going to stall out for a while again? Well, you know, I mean, the thing is, it's really not about the Yen. It's really about the US dollar. And so the question to ask is, you know, will the US dollar continue to get high? I mean, that's the way we see it. And yes, it looks like the US dollar will get high. I mean, we are now projecting that, you know, there'll be two 75-year-olds going to get high in November and December and who knows? Perhaps even more, if inflation doesn't come down. Yeah, so, you know, given that backdrop, the US dollar is like the strength and further, that's going to pose headaches for the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank in Japan. And so, you know, I was just listening to you show earlier and you talked about 150 to the US dollar. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens because the dollar is fairly strong and there are no reasons for the dollar to, you know, take a step back because interest rates in the US are likely to hit high and you could see more supersized 75-year-olds point rate hikes in the coming months. All right, Bowsu Manan. Thank you so much. Executive Director of Investment Strategy at OCBC Bank Wealth Management. Now, let's get to Bonnie Quinn with the first word headlines, Bonnie. Thanks for your time. UK Chancellor of the Ex-Jakery Jeremy Hunt has a kind to rule out delaying by a year, the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic rate of income tax. Such a move would amount to another U-turn on a key plank of Prime Minister Liz Tross' mini budget. Hunt has made clear that calming the markets is his priority and says he intends to show that the government can account for every penny of its tax and spending pounds. The European Union's executive arm is planning a mechanism to curb price volatility in the box biggest gas marketplace. It wants to prevent extreme price spikes and derivatives trading to rein in the region's energy crisis. The temporary mechanism would impose a dynamic price limit for transactions on the Dutch title transfer facility. The benchmark for oil gas traded on the continent. Hong Kong media reports say China may further relax its border restrictions with the city by year end. The South China Morning Post sides Hong Kong's deputy to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, saying the current seven-day hotel quarantine period could be cut to four days. Singed how daily also reports that the mainland may allow more visitors to cross the border from Hong Kong each day. The Australian government will reportedly pledge $6 billion US dollars for infrastructure projects in its October budget. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told News Agency AAP that the spending would create jobs and unlock growth and productivity. Treasure regime Chalmers told us the global inflation fight highlights the importance for Australia of responsible budgeting. We can't have in budgets spending which is excessive or poorly targeted. If we have money spraying around in all directions in budgets that will make the job of our independent central banks that much harder. And so our intention is to provide some cost of living relief that has an economic dividend by which I mean it won't make the inflation problem worse. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on boomerick quick take. Powered by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. I'm Vanne Quinn. This is Bloomberg Heidi. All right let's take a look at some of the early move as when it comes to the energy space bill. Yeah Heidi we're seeing some moves there but also just kicking off of what we're seeing a cow this morning so this is one of South Korea's biggest tech giants. Also neighbors well you can see here a bit of a drop at the open but this is down to a fire that broke out in a city or region south of Seoul where a lot of tech companies are based and basically fire at a data service center rather that disrupted services for these companies. They do say that they're working on restoring operations as soon as possible and in inquiry has been ordered into the incident.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3674,2022-10-17 00:13:17
15389," that disrupted services for these companies. They do say that they're working on restoring operations as soon as possible. And in inquiry, it has been ordered into the incident. Turning now to what else we see for other stocks that are moving in the session this morning, if you take a look at this start of trade for the energy stocks, changing on now, we are seeing moves to the downside for most of them. Given the moves that we've seen in the oil space, Brent Crew just fractionally hires we get trading underway, but still lower with another weekly slump. And then also finally just taking a look at the bank stocks this morning in Asia, we are seeing particular losses from a quarry bank in Australia this morning, but we did have results coming through. If you just change on now from JP Morgan and a city group and really watching their Kathleen, what comes through in the net interest income. Okay, Annabelle still ahead. Sishing being pledged as victory in the global tech battle after the US moved to separate China from chip technology. Former US Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, Frank Lavish gives us a take later. Plus, we assess the Chinese president's comments on Taiwan and it's a futile to rule out the use of military force to reunify the country. That discussion in just a moment, this is Bloomberg. three. four. four. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life family isn't becoming more digital. Well I'm trying to prevent that but yeah, I think it's happening. And you know and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. We put the people and their lives above all else and to naturally pursue item and re-recorded policy brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength, the central government, exercise of overall jurisdiction over the special administrative regions as prescribed by China's constitution and basic role of the Hong Kong special administrative region. And ensure that Hong Kong is administered by patriots resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese, a matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renew the use of force.

15390," To re-nounce the use of force, we must meet obstacles and difficulties head on, ensure both development and security and dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. Chinese President Xi Jinping, they're opening the Communist Party Congress, which takes place every five years. For more let's bring our Chief North Asia correspondent, Stephen Angle and Bloomberg opinions, Julie Ren. And Steve, I'll start off with you, of course, not a great deal of surprises, but the same assertive, strident approach from the president. Yeah, I mean, in reflection again, 24 hours after this speech, I kind of felt he was a bit, it was a bit of a sober speech. You know, three hours plus the five years ago, this time it was under two hours and he got right to the point on a number of issues, which of course we've been watching for. On COVID-19, he didn't necessarily talk about the downside to the economy of COVID-19 and the lockdowns, but did hail that the party and these policies helped save lives and is basically the way we need to read into it is it's not going away anytime soon, but the fact that he did not give a roadmap or dates or anything like that could leave that open to interpretation that they could start gradually easing. That's the hopeful, the optimist in me saying that. But again, not a lot of definitive outlook for COVID-19. Now, Taiwan was another issue. He reaffirmed again that peaceful reunification is a top goal. It is their preferred way through this, but they said reunification must happen and can happen. And if they have to, they will use force. And then again, probably the one topic with the most geopolitical overtones as well as international appeal is his assertion that they could become more self-reliant in high-tech technology in the face, of course, of the more recent Biden restrictions on chip sales to Chinese chip factories. Surely to you now, in terms of why the party Congress is so important, what's the key takeaway? And what's your way in a bit on Taiwan? What emotion? What intensity you sensed in Xi's comments there? Very intense. This party Congress is important in that it's the Communist Party's pitch to the entire nation why it should be the party to rule and the way its vision is for the next five years. So, I think it's helpful. And also, we all know President Xi Jinping is very secretive. No one knows where he's thinking, right? So it's very helpful to listen to this speech and compare to the 2022-25 years ago in 2017. And you can just tell his hard-and-mind are looking outward. He's looking at the geopolitics and the technological competition with the US. And I think it's at 10 to 15 percent of the speech when he was talking about external influences affecting China's internal affairs. He was referring to Taiwan. His voice cracked with passion. And then you know what this guy is into. So Taiwan is on the top of his mind. Now, Shulei, you could have stayed to a shame. Sorry, go ahead, Heidi. No, Steve, you go. I'm really quite curious as to what you were going to ask. Sorry, Shulei, I just want to ask you about the tone. You're a Mandarin speaker. You can get the tone a lot easier than I can as a second language, obviously. You felt that his voice was cracking a bit. Was he a bit angry? Did you get that sense? Yes. And what does that mean? What do we need to read into that? He's visibly angry. So this speech has 15 sections. And a lot of them are ideological blah, blah, blah. He swam through. You can just tell he was going through the procedure, right? But when he talked about geopolitics and China's right to have its own path to modernization, he was very, very passionate. And he also talked about, you know, China needs to retain talent in science and engineering. And then you can tell that's where his passionate is as well. Shulei, I was going to ask, is it a mistake for foreign...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3676,2022-10-17 00:21:35
15391," Science and engineering. And then you can tell that's where his passion is as well. Julie, I was going to ask, is it a mistake for foreign investors to assume that just because there will be changes in some of the top leadership positions, that the policies, the key policies, like public health, like the regulatory crackdown, that any of that is going to change? I think it's interesting. If you look at the speech, it's what very formulaic. The first part is basically touting China's achievements in the past five years. So he talked about COVID-0, how he kept China safe by implementing COVID-0. But in the local health session, especially in people's livelihood, he didn't talk about COVID-0 or housing is to be lived and not speculated now. Not in the verbal speech, which gives us some hope and optimism. I am with Stephen here. That perhaps China is not going to have COVID-0 until 2027. And also, he still talked about economic development, which was, I think, a positive outlook compared to market expectations. Chief North Asia correspondent Stephen Engel and Bloomberg, opinion, Julie Rimm with a very interesting roundtable for Sun Xi Jinping's speech. Coming up, UK Prime Minister Luz Truss set to face fresh market judgment without the backing of the Bank of England's emergency bond buying program. And if you don't know what that means, we're going to find out next. This is Bloomberg. Thank you. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm. And we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. UK Prime Minister Liz Trass is there. This is going to be a key week when it comes to testing the volatility that we've seen across the guilds and the pound. We have seen the pound rising in early Asian trading. Some confidence really bolstered by these expectations that we are expecting to see more of the Prime Minister's package of unfunded tax cuts being reversed. Take a look at Euro futures at the moment. We are seeing some downside when it comes to stocks 50 futures. About 710s of 1% lower German DAX futures also looking a little bit one at this point. MSI Europe actually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3677,2022-10-17 00:25:23
15392," We are seeing some downside when it comes to stocks 50 futures, about 7 tens of 1 percent lower German DAX futures also looking a little bit one at this point. MSR Europe actually seeing some modest gains. We saw European stocks gaining in the last trading session of the week trimming. Some of the earlier extent of the rally, though investors are of course whilst watching what's going on in the UK, also weighing that worsting outlook for US inflation after last week CPI print and the impact on just how stormfully hawkish the Fed will get. Well UK financial markets are just getting a fresh opportunity soon to pass judgement on this trust's economic programme. This time without the Bank of England around to offset any turmoil, Bloomberg effects and rates strategist David Finity joins us now. So as we see this really tug of war playing out between the government and the Bank of England, what are the levels that you're watching for when it comes to trading in the pound as well as guilds? Well certainly in the pound the initial level is a 114.95. That's the recent high in October. I think it was October the fifth. So we still have quite a bit of weight from that but you would expect that obviously it's been a positive reaction today. That's a good sign for guilds, is that you expect guilds to rally a bit as well. I think the big worry for guilds is that even if there's initial rally, you have UK CPI due on Wednesday. So that's not good news because that's supposed to go up from 9.9 to 10% so that could very quickly put pressure on guilds. So again, even if they rally today, you have to dodge a CPI due bullet and if that comes in higher than expected, more pressure on guilds. I mean you look at last week's slows, are they tested? So any rally need, it can maybe be a near term rally in guilds. Really I think it's where they are. The end of the week could be the definition of how all this data and developments with the UK government has played out. So Dave, when it comes to I guess assessing where policy goes from here, is there a sense that obviously some sense of fiscal responsibility might be returning to the four? How does that play out if we see the pound staging recovery against some of these Asian pairs like the yen? Yeah, I think certainly the idea of fiscal, a bit more fiscal responsibility is certainly positive for the pound. I mean you have to remember one of its problems is it's got a government, they have governments running a budget deficit and this is why all this, except the additional spending is worrying the market because like, well how is it going to be paid for? Having said that, even if you have some of the policies being returned, there's still these sums that have not been returned, idea being that there's still at the moment about 20 to 25 billion outstanding that's to be paid for based on the present plans. So that's still not a positive for the market and therefore really any pound rally should be say is a bit limited because those needs to be sorted out. Obviously the markets we're looking at the OBR projections next week when the new chance of exchequer Jeremy Meahunt comes out and revises his new mini budget and we find more details and obviously the BROE afterwards. So any rally missturning could be short lived, particularly if dollar maintains its strength and pushes forward. David, at the G30 meeting when Andrew Bailey was on stage with Klaus Knot and Haruhiukukuroda, when Andrew Bailey spoke, he made it very clear that he and Jeremy Hunt were now in solid agreement. In far from it looks like the government fighting the BROE now, now that the former, this situation has changed so dramatically that what is this, how is this going to, when the market gets this, that they are now almost like arm in arm on what they need to do, how is that going to affect GILTS, Pound, etc.? It's certainly a positive in the near term that the more in the same page, how much on the same page needs to be fully seen by again, what exactly is this mini budget, how many other things are you turned on, is the basic income tax from 20 down to 19, is that pushback, is national insurance pushback on that revision for it to be not raised up. So with some more details that need to be found, so yes, the more on the same page than Andrew Bailey was with Quasie Quarting, but the market is still going up, there's still unfunded items on this mini budget, that needs to be explained. The catch with the B.O.E. said, particular inflation comes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3678,2022-10-17 00:30:21
15393," But the market is still going up. There's still unfunded items on this mini budget. That needs to be explained. And the catch with the BRE said, particular inflation coming out this week, if it's rising, the markets can go up. BRE at the moment, we're looking for you to hike 100 bases point next, and we're looking for about another 90 bases points in December. So the BRE doesn't come through and do its part of the equation. The markets say, look, there's pressure on guilt and pressure on stirring very quickly as well. So it's going to take both of them to fulfill the end of the bargain, should we say, to keep the markets happy. All right, David. But that was another thing Andrew Bailey made clear that more rate hikes are coming and maybe more than they thought was needed earlier. So it's going to be an interesting road. Thank you, David Finnerty for joining us. So plenty more to come on daybreak Asia. Keep it right here because this is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather and temperatures that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We do have non-oil domestic exports from Singapore just across the Bloomberg. We're seeing that number coming into the construction of 4%, that's a seasonally adjusted month-on-month number coming into the construction of 4%, following that 3.9% contraction the previous month. We had been expecting for the month of September again of 4% to 1%. That is certainly a miss. We're also seeing the electronics imports being stripped out at a decline of almost 11%. We saw in the previous month, the headline, a notex number coming in at 3.1%, missing expectations for 6.9%, and really pairing gains after we saw over 11% gain in the month of August. In particular, if you take a look at the contraction for demand to China, contracting almost 34% year-on-year electronics was a big component of that fall, and really this comes after we saw another move by the MAS to tweak its monetary policy to tighten to follow along the tightening that we continue to see from the Fed. Although having said that last week's GDP print was actually pretty good and showed the extent to which that reopening for Singapore's borders and the resumption of post-COVID activity really did.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3679,2022-10-17 00:34:05
15394," That last big GDP print was actually pretty good and showed the extent to which that re-opening for Singapore's borders and the resumption of post-COVID activity really did play into that rebound. But the exports number really not looking very good and certainly that plays into the picture bell of the slowing import demand pulse that we see from China. The idea is something that we have seen across other North Asian economies as well, the likes of Japan, Korea, certainly very dependent on the health of the mainland economy for their exports picture. But in terms of the outlook for Asian equities today, we are looking fairly risk off at the start of trade half an hour into the session now for Japan and Korea. We here really broad-based declines here. Real estate is one of the few sectors that is pointing high. Financials also, if we do see anything positive, perhaps could be the lead here, given that we saw those improving net interest income margins for the likes of JP Morgan and bank earnings well underway in the US. We are changing the picture now to take a look at what else we are watching. Currencies are very much in focus this morning as well. We are eyeing the yen this morning, trading near that key 150 level. This would be a key intervention level as well and traders are focused for that. Goldman Sachs says we could hit 150 within three months and that is down to that growing policy divergence gap between the US and Japan. Also keeping an eye on what we are seeing with the pound this morning. Traders really seeming to like this chance of a further reversal of the package of unfunded tax cuts from the UK. Also the leadership changes that Liz Truss made at the weekend and that is also putting in more stability back into the Treasury's trade for half an hour into cash treasuries as well. In terms of the outlook though for UK stocks looking fractionally weaker here and also very much focused on how China opens in one hour from now the signs afford to the downside the open there. Kathleen, this is really down to that lack of policy pivot announcements that came through at the weekend. Well, let's get now to Bonnie Quinn with the first word headlines. So I mean, Kathleen, thank you. Well, as I was saying, Chinese President Xi Jinping says China is saying the core says that faces what he called dangerous storms and growing challenges from the United States. In an almost two hour speech to open the five yearly Communist Party Congress, she said China would pursue development while ensuring national security. He also said Taiwan reunification was a matter for the Chinese and hailed what he called the restoration of order in Hong Kong. A senior White House official says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Ria after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production. Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has won the majority of seats in my elections, building momentum in its campaign for an early national poll. Khan was contesting seven of the eight seats in play, and with 90 percent of the vote counted had won five of them. He left a resign from Albert one seat, but the victory suggests many voters support his political narrative. South Korean boyband BTS has formed together for what could be the last time in years. Saturday's concert in Busan was to promote Kassal Korea's second biggest city as a candidate to hold a 2030 world expo. Back in June, the band said it would go on indefinite hiatus, the members focusing on solo projects. The oldest singer also faces a deadline this year to begin compulsory military service. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, a quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Bonnie Quentis. This is Bloomberg. Heidi. Well, what a weekend it was for BTS fans, but I didn't actually watch the concert, but I know so many people who did. They were just desperate to get this last glimpse of a performance, a break in order to pursue solo projects, right? But the fact of the matter is, what can possibly replace, not just the soft power, the cultural power of this group, but also just the sheer economic power that it's brought to South Korea. And arguably just such a big factor when it comes to the country's international appeal across a number of different generations. Yeah, that's right, Heidi. When you take a look at in fact, at the share performance of Big Hit Entertainment, so we're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3680,2022-10-17 00:38:57
15395," peel across a number of different generations. Yeah, that's right, Heidi. When you take a look at, in fact, at the share performance of Big Hit Entertainment, so we're down, you can see a near 10% slump over five days, but we're also down below the IPO trading price given that shock announcement that came through in June. And then you just mentioned that overall economic value. Actually, when you take a look at the trade balance of Korea in the first half of this year, intellectual property was actually posting a huge surplus. And that really does indicate the ongoing need for Korean IP and the power of K-pop, other cultural icons. So certainly it's something to be watching. And as you said, a lot of concerns or questions, should these members be completing their military service? All right. It is a touchy exemption to be granting, isn't it, particularly when there's deep disparities when it comes to wealth and social equality in this market and in this economy and I should say, but I suppose it remains to be seen whether we could see another K-pop band really replace the huge cultural, economic power that BTS has. I mean, I have been listening to a bit of Blackpink, Kathleen. Yes, I was great. Thanks, Ellen. Yeah, Blackpink. It's certainly one to be watching. That was one of the bands that could be a potential front runner to replace BTS. If that military service does need to come through, but Kathleen, I don't know your views on the K-pop scene. Well, you know, it's not my main form of music, but I have to say, you know, it's partly because I mean, when I watch it, I love it. It's partly because the dancing is so great, right? I mean, it's not just the music, it's the movement too. And I'm a sucker for that. So I have to say, and watching videos like that certainly makes me want to watch it more. Anyway, let's go on to Chinese Decelerate Quattro Marta has reported third quarter net income of 14.6 billion yuan, a 16 percent increase year on year. Liberty Intelligence sees the company on track to meet its full-year sales target. So let's bring in BI consumer industry analysts, Adali. So what's your outlook for the rest of the year? So Quattro Marta reported a 16 percent year over year growth for both its revenue and net income line for the third quarter. And this is largely driven by its direct to consumer sales, which almost or more than doubled of that last year. The company has a 15 percent year on year growth or 126 billion yuan sales target for the full year of 2022. And we believe that this company is on track to deliver that for the rest of the year. So the company has been under pressure on the back of this alcohol ban. And the problem with Guizhou Maltese is that it's so susceptible to the whims of policy-making and leadership mandates, isn't it? Correct. So the company share project has been under quite a bit of pressure in the recent weeks because of the market speculations of potential stricter alcohol ban for the Chinese civil servants. What we have seen so far is that we haven't seen any official statement about stricter ban or stricter alcohol ban, so to speak. And it is important to note that these type of alcohol ban have already been rolling out since 2012, and most of the very strict ones are already in place. Bloomberg Intelligence, unless Italy there will cover up Chinese presidency in being pledged as to win the tech battle against the U.S., the former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for International Trade, Frank Levin joins us next with his views.

15397," Concentrate resources on original and pioneering scientific and technological research to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies in key fields. Let's bring in Frank Lavon now. He's founder and chairman at Export Now, which operates e-commerce stores in China for international brands. He previously served as a U.S. Undersecretary for Commerce for International Trade. So Frank, it's great to have you back on the show, you know, on the heels of this very important speech. Now, if it weren't for President Biden's U.S. curb on China when it comes to chips, so important to developing key things that they need to develop, maybe this wouldn't be resonating so much. But against that backdrop, how strident, how aggressive, what is what is steaching being trying to tell not just the world, but in particular the U.S.? Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. Thanks for having me back, I should say, but look, this speech is taking place in context in the context is a deterioration in U.S.-China relations, especially trade relations and President Biden has imposed export bans on technology and chip technology to China. So this is a reassuring message from Xi, an attempt to be reassuring to his constituencies to say we're going to plow ahead on our own, we're going to devote the resources and effort on our own to close that gap and to make up for whatever shortfall there might be in this ban from the United States. You know, another key issue here is the Taiwan reunification, Shui Lee Ren, who is a Mandarin speaker, made the point that in this part of the speech, he really picked up that his voice even shook at one time, that he is angry about this. What did you pick up? Look, Taiwan is the most important domestic political issue in China. It is obligatory for anybody who aspires to senior leadership in the Chinese Communist Party to be forceful if not strident on Taiwan. Part of what she is doing is passing a test, but I wouldn't allocate all of the interpretation of this to simply domestic Chinese politics. I think they are also serious about this, that they don't want to see any change in the status of Taiwan that want to see a move toward independence. They want to caution the United States about formatting or incentivizing independence streak in Taiwan. So they're serious about trying to manage it on their terms in the near future. Frank, at the same time we're seeing their mode of domestic governance covered zero. The other aspects of how this is playing out for the economy, the property sector, consumer demand being depressed. All of this is starting to constrain growth. You see this in the trade numbers. We just had the Singapore export numbers when it comes to demand from China shrinking over 30% for September. What does that mean for businesses in your area? And how I guess China is reshaped in terms of whether or not it can continue being the economic powerhouse for both demand and supply? I think the zero tolerance policy in China, the lockdown policies in China have caused considerable disruption to the Chinese economy. Now Beijing will say the benefit is worth it. There's health benefits to it. But to my mind, they could have I think accomplished a lot of the benefits of that without these sort of massive and pervasive and dislocating lockdowns. And I think the ripple effect is going to go on for some time. So I think they really went for a very rigid or very orthodox approach on COVID. They're paying a huge economic price for it. And they're not going to be able to easily turn the lights which back on next year having turned it off this year. So it's a longer term problem for the Chinese economy. So what are you seeing from a business perspective for your business in terms of that demand and activity? Sure. I can tell you specifically in e-commerce you have a collapse in demand in certain segments like apparel and beauty beauty in apparel, typically the two largest segments of consumer goods in Chinese e-commerce. So if you have lockdown, you don't need a new shirt or you don't need a new skin cream. So demand just collapses in those areas. It also disrupts work habits and office activity and experimentation. So it's a it has a depressive effect on the whole economy. So in terms of the the next steps for China, what is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3683,2022-10-17 00:51:41
15398," So, in terms of the next steps for China, what is at the top of the list? It caught many people are saying, for example, that COVID-0 may not be going away for a long, long time, although some thought that maybe after the party Congress, that's when she would be able to say, okay, we're doing better. We can start softening this, start winding it down. What do you think is the next big step from Xi Jinping? I've been that second group. I think the point of the party Congress is this is consistent with Chinese political culture. He's not there to be defensive or to apologize. His message of the party Congress is, we did the right things for the right reasons. We took the right steps to safeguard China's health. So it is almost a defiant or a resolute posture that he's taking. And it's accepted and amplified by the party structure. That's for today. But my guess is when we get through the holidays, we start looking at January, we will see some lightning or some experimentation. We'll see I think a reduction in quarantine for international visits. And I think we'll see a lighter touch when it comes to lockdowns and a slight move away from that zero tolerance. But Chinese government tends to move incrementally and I don't think they move until next year. Frank really great to have you with us.

15399," So are there any silver linings for investors? Yeah, there are definitely a few sectors that investors got a little bit of sort of more confidence towards after the speech. That would include hard tech hardware. She featured tech hardware prominently in his speech, talking about how advanced manufacturing would be the foundation of a modern nation. So that's definitely one to watch out for. There is another one that is property that is interesting because she did not mention in his speech that housing is for living, not for speculation. So that is burying some hopes of further easing for the sector over the support for the imbattered sector. Another one to watch out for is green energy sector. She kept talking about it, but there is a bit of a caveat, which is we won't see an immediate transition into green energy. He in his word, China won't rush into it. That's just because China is still facing high energy costs and China. For that reason won't stop burning fossil fuels until it's confident that clean energy can reliably replace them. Very important issues. China will also release key economic data on Tuesday. So what are you expecting? Yeah, so the expectation is for very modest increase or improvement for overall GDP and other economic data. Economists are expecting GDP to expand by about 3.4% in the third quarter. And that compare with almost 0% growth in the second quarter just because cities like Shanghai were locked down. And if you look at individual or other key data, I think retail sales will probably show a bit of a slowdown to 3.5% in September. And that's just because COVID-0 is very much a very prevailing policy still in China. But industrial production will probably have stabilized because there is more infrastructure spending in the past few months. All right, the intent to our Asia stocks managing editor. So some stocks were watching ahead of markets opening Hong Kong and China. Others, he were others than tech. Well, actually, excuse me, we're watching Taiwan semiconductor.

15400," The biggest differentiator of a successful entity does is announce it's an entity. So you've got to do everything possible, to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. I mean, you really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. You know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money. And that's the only reason people come to world. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person. I have to worry about my family. I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has to be engaged. So we have to be shown more empathy, show that we care that their citizens and the community, your members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee, and be a pus to the community in the family. The stakes are higher. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice of such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology, Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. It's 9am in Beijing and Hong Kong. Welcome to Bloomberg Market, China Open. I'm Yvonne Mann. Our top story is this morning, President, she opens the party congress, saying the economy is top priority, but gives no sign for investors of any relief on COVID-0 or the property sector. The tech sector, meanwhile, invokes us she also vows victory over US attempts to block China's access to the latest chip technology. Plus, the pound rallies in Asia, investors bet Prime Minister Liz Trusses on funded tax cuts may be reversed by the new chancellor. A lot of questions about that, but then again, we're still looking at digesting, looking for all these tea leaves here from President Xi's two hours speech from yesterday. The key question today is how will markets respond to that? There were some signs of maybe some about the tech hardware side, green energy that we're looking at, but certainly no policy changes when it comes to COVID-0 and the property sector will dig a little bit deeper throughout the show this morning. But the backdrop is not looking too good. Just give what we saw in the Friday session in the US, that sort of post CPI induced surprise rally. Yeah, that didn't quite last, right? So we are still seeing risk assets falling here, stocks are lower by more than 1% in New Zealand, Australia. Taiwan just coming online as well, we're lower by 1.5%. She also mentioned a lot about Taiwan too, so we'll focus on the geopolitics. And we're watching dollar yen very closely. We're getting very close to that 150 level here. So intervention watch once again. We're watching when it comes to China assets as well. Futures are pointing lower by 6.10% of 1%. We punched above 720 for your offshore rate as well. 720 and 151, we have the MLF coming up in just a few minutes. Unchange is what the economists are expecting here.

15401," change is what the economists are expecting here, but also that eco data, that trade data, we're supposed to get on Friday, I didn't quite come out yet. We don't know why, but that could come out here in the next few hours or a few days or so as well. 270 for your Chinese 10-year yield, cruise a bit lower here in Shanghai and take a look at when it comes to US futures, stock futures in Europe as well. We're in the red for your stocks. 50 futures, FTSE 100 futures as well. A lot of U-turns, right? So we have a new chancellor in the UK, Jeremy Hunt, can he win over the capital markets? How much trust can they actually put on him to reverse some of these policies that we've seen so far? So 112 for sterling here, there's more than U.S. futures are still in the green. Well, with a defiance, shooting ping, opening up the Communist Party Congress by reaffirming policies that are the center of frictions with the U.S. Take a listen. We put the people and their lives above all else and to necessarily pursue a dynamic theoretical policy brought about historical rights in China's economic strength. The central government exercises overall jurisdiction over the special administrative regions as prescribed by China's constitution and basic law of the Hong Kong special administrative region. I mean, sure that Hong Kong is necessary by patriots resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese. A matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force. We must meet obstacles and difficulties head on, ensure both development and security and dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. All right, Herr War, let's bring in our Chief Minister of Correspondence, Stephen Engel, here with me and we were here yesterday, throughout the two hours. What stood out to you the most, Steve? Well, you know, we shouldn't misinterpret his sort of somber tone. He gives this sort of, it comes across as a bit mellow in his delivery, but really, and we talked to Shuley Ren earlier, a Bloomberg opinion columnist, essentially he's saying she read it as he kind of had this undercurrent of anger to his delivery and to his voice, whether it is on Taiwan and perceived U.S. interference on Taiwan. Obviously, on technological advancements and the banning, if you will, more recent banning by the Biden administration of high tech, chip exports to Chinese fabs, and that China will be self-reliant, and that is a main goal as well. And oftentimes you do have to read into what she says for following policy in 2017. He talked about the property market is to be lived in, homes are to be lived in, not speculated on, and lo and behold, we got a bunch of regulation on the property sector that is still being sifted through, and by the way, he did not mention property at all and the drags on the economy of this time around. So, I guess the main takeaway is a defiant Xi Jinping. In a much shorter, concise speech, less than two hours, than five years ago, when he spoke for more than three hours and talked about China standing tall and firm in the East. This time, he was a more combative Xi Jinping saying, we are going to stand tall and firm, I'm paraphrasing, but again, we're going to lead by example and be a leader in this part of the world as an leading example and an alternative, perhaps, to the United States. Steve Sikarang, let's bring in our next guest, Susan Shirk, a research professor and chair of the 21st century China Center at the University of California, San Diego. She was U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton. She's also got a book out about Chinese politics called overreach. How China derailed its peaceful rise. She joins us now from New York. Susan, always great to have you here in the program. Just maybe your initial take of Xi's speech and the tone in which she struck. Well, there really were no surprises in this speech. Xi Jinping covered all the bases.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3687,2022-10-17 01:09:16
15402," Xi Jinping covered all the bases, the same sections that we saw in previous speeches. He aimed to strike a triumphant tone of all the great things he's accomplished, but this will be kind of a difficult cell because China right now has so many problems, many of which actually have been caused by Chinese policies and Xi Jinping's own policies. So what was most interesting to me was that he compared the current situation to 10 years ago and tried to make the case that the earlier administration, Hu Jintao, was kind of weak and hollow and that his centralized leadership had achieved great progress for China. But in fact, what we see is, as you mentioned, the backlash from much of the world to Chinese foreign policy, zero COVID refusing to adjust that policy and damaging the economy with that. And of course, the attacks on the private sector as well. So he does face a big challenge here of persuading the party elite that despite his own reaching, which have created these problems for China, that China is doing great. It seems like the Defiantone masking some of the problems facing the economy. We talked about COVID-0, the real-state sector as well, Susan. I think he did mention economic development as a top priority, very following some of his predecessors since 2002, but then twice, I think he mentioned about balancing that with national security as well. Should we assume that growth no longer will be a top priority in the coming years? Well, he talks about the quality of economic development, high quality economic development, which is actually a slogan from the Hu Jintao era that he has adopted. So he checked the box on the economy, but the focus is very much on security. And his vision is that China is threatened externally and internally, and it takes a strong man leader like himself to defend China's interests. So it was a focus on resolve rather than problem solving. Susan, Stephen Engel here. I did read some of the snippets of your new book called Overreach, but I also remember one of your previous books in 2008 when I was the China correspondent in Beijing. It was called the fragile superpower. So where has China gone in your estimation from the fragile superpower to a superpower that is overreaching? Is that in your estimation directly tied to what Xi Jinping was able to accomplish five years ago, and that was essentially abolished term limits, and now he has absolute power, if you will. Well, I do think actually my book argues that Overreach started in the second term of Hu Jintao, but has gotten much, much worse under this centralized, over centralized leadership, what Deng Xiaoping himself had talked about in criticizing the Mao era as over-concentration of authority because the system itself, not just Xi Jinping's own ideas, but what happens is that everyone who works for Xi Jinping, all the other officials, are really afraid that they could be targeted as being disloyal, using the anti-corruption campaign to go after them because that anti-corruption campaign still continues to this day, and right before the party congress to very senior, what can you say to me on theategory 12 of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3688,2022-10-17 01:13:18
15403," That anti-corruption campaign still continues to this day, and right before the party Congress, to very senior former officials from this security and disciplinary bureaucracies, who themselves had been in charge of the anti-corruption purge, or were themselves targeted. So I think China remains fragile largely in terms of elite cohesion. And she seemed to be defensive in that regard. I think you described the US-China relationship recently as a hostile competition. Is this Cold War version two? Well I think it's of course very different from the US-Soviet Cold War, but I call it a Cold War because it's pretty hostile if you look at the policies of both sides. And fortunately it's not yet a military confrontation. But unless we can find a way to resume some diplomacy, reassure one another about not being threats to one another, I think that we are headed toward something that could be a military confrontation. So it's, and there's nothing, of course, in what Xi Jinping said tonight that would give any part to the hope of some kind of reconciliation with the United States or with other Western countries, democratic countries. In fact he touted the superiority of his system over them. And so I think your book also explores a little bit about that of what the West can do. What is the proper response then, in dealing with a more defiant and confrontational China? Well my own view is we should be aware of overreacting to Xi's overreaching, overreacting in a way that makes what Xi Jinping said tonight about the world being hostile to China. In some sense our policies have fed into that narrative in a way that maybe to many people in China. So I believe some diplomatic initiatives after the midterm, after the party congress would be very important to demonstrate to the Chinese people that America at least is not unalterably hostile to China. And it's not trying to contain it rise. Susan, great to get your thoughts. Susan Sharf, their resource professor and chair of the 21st century China Center at UC San Diego. Let's get to the first word news now. We have Bonnie Quinn in New York. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Yvonne, thank you and good morning. UK Chancellor of the X-Jack or Jeremy Hunt has declined to rule out delaying by a year of the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic rate of income tax. Such a move would it mount to another U-turn on a key plank of Prime Minister Liz Trez's mini budget. Hunt has made clear that calming the markets is his priority and says he intends to show that the government can account for every penny of its tax and spending plans. A delayed statement from G20 Finance, ministers and central bankers has laid bare divisions on issues including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions, but clashes between major nations meant that this time it took three days. Hong Kong media reports say China may further relax its border restrictions with the city by year end.

All right. Your PBOC fix just crossing here. Perfect timing. 7, 10, 95. Okay. This is quite a strong one here when it comes to this fix here. The estimate was 7, 1977. So we're talking about 900 or so bips of stronger. So this is another record. I think 32nd time. This is the 33rd. I can't even keep count here on stronger bicep from the PBOC. We also have the MLF coming out in just a few minutes as well. This is Bloomberg. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. You know, and COVID has accelerated that, the industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lakes. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. All right, take a look at that. You're fixed just recapping it. That was actually a record, right? Strongest bias on record for that remedy fixed year at 7 to 95. So it was about 900 bips or so, given with my fast math here. But certainly you are seeing a little bit of the PVOC trying to lean against this weakness that we've seen after the offshore remedy there, hitting above that 720 level, where near those record lows for your offshore rate, but we're still having around 721-80 here this morning. Of course, still kind of look through this reaction to President Xi Jinping's speech as well. Let's bring in what this all means with a market implications from the party Congress. Goldman Sachs recently came out with their note after Xi's speech and saying, the ongoing party Congress may not be that inflection point you're looking for. For major policy changes, a reopening will probably be delayed to at least the second quarter of 2023 and implemented gradually to the extent possible. Let's bring in Goldman Sachs' chief Asia Pacific equity strategist Tim Moe for more on his thoughts as well. So was there anything Tim? Anything that we could get from that two-hour speech on where the next direction is for markets? Well, thanks, if I'm following me on. Quick answer is not a lot. I mean, it was more retrospective than prospective. The market's attention, as we all know, is very much on a week from Sunday or week from yesterday where the new lineup...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3690,2022-10-17 01:22:12
15405," active than prospective. The market's attention, as we all know, is very much on a week from Sunday or week from yesterday, where the new lineup of the Politburo and the Zandy Committee will be announced. And I've just actually just returned from the U.S. to speak with a number of investors. And I can say that that's really where the market's attention appears to be focused because it's a question of whether there will be any significant composition change. And also whether there will be any indication, as you just said, about the timing of some relaxation on the zero COVID side. Our baseline is that that will not happen until after the the national, the twin sessions, the NPC in March. And the key point also is that any move away from zero COVIDs like to be gradual. So we're really not going to see probably the reopening real effect in terms of a recovery in growth into the second half. The market may well discount that earlier, perhaps first or second quarter, but that's kind of the timing that we're exactly at this point. You've also been talking about the high level of risk premium that's already been priced into these valuations. What is that single to you too? Is it all priced in? Or can things moderate from here? Well, we certainly hope so or optimistic that that can happen. So there's, I guess, just a couple of very quick points. One is that on pretty much any metric you look at China is really beaten down in terms of valuation. So to put a few numbers around that, the MSCI China index is trading about 9.1 times Ford PE. And that's well over a standard deviation to the south side of its traditional trading range. We also see that relative to our fair value macro model that the market is trading below what just pure macro circumstances would suggest. And that in turn shows that there's some degree of extra risk premium for perhaps political uncertainty or policy uncertainty that is that is already reflected in the market. And then additionally, we can see that positioning is quite light by investors, whether mutual funds or hedge funds and so forth. So you know, all that suggests that there is some potential for upside recovery if we get some fundamentally encouraging news in terms of reopening. So that does suggest that there's some positive skew there. But I think it's also fair to say or realistic to say that we do need that in order to really get some better risk appetite in the market and so forth that seems to be lacking. If I could add, the clear view that we have to be really explicit for the audience is that our strong preference is for Ashares versus the offshore stocks. There's a host of reasons for that that perhaps we don't have to go into. But we do think that Ashares will broadly align with where the policy is and the one of the card of rules of investing in China is you want to be attuned with what the government policy, the direction of that as opposed to fighting it. And so we think you have a much better opportunity for that in the Ashares. Hold up that Tim. We just have that MLF just crossing the PBC keeping that one year MLF rate unchanged at 275. That was pretty much it was expected by most and if I think all economists here also offering 500 billion R&B in that MLF that was due in October as well. We kind of knew the PBC was going to refrain from cutting rates further, just given the fact that they don't they really want to just avoid that downward pressure on the R&B as well. Tim maybe flesh out that view A versus H. H at what point is this actually a screaming by me. Some people say if you're looking for any sort of bearish positioning, Hong Kong is where to go. Why not lean towards there? Yeah, for sure. I think it really is a question of do you want to focus more on where there's a clearer strategic direction, a really a genuine sort of investment area or do you want to be perhaps a little bit more tactical and play for a recovery in oversold stocks, which would be more of a tactical one. So I really would position this kind of strategic versus tactical. Very quickly on the strategic side, there are a number of we think very, very compelling reasons which support A shares and just to rival a couple off. I mean, number one, they're clearly a much less responsive to any concerns on the geopolitical front, which obviously is very top of mind now. For a couple of key reasons, A, that 95% of the stocks are owned by domestic investors and therefore much less sort of you know at the whim of any kind of incremental buying or selling by foreigners. And number two, if you look at the correlation of A shares with global markets, it's like 35% compared to in the mid 70s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3691,2022-10-17 01:26:45
15406," be incremental buying or selling by foreigners. And number two, if you look at the correlation of asia's with global markets, it's like 35% compared to the mid 70s for all the other markets in Asia. So much less responsive to global issues. Additionally, what we see is that something like over 80% of the asia's are actually in the common prosperity zone of the industries that are beneficially in the common prosperity policy compared to much lower, like in the 40s for the offshore stocks. And so we think they do as well. Thank you. We'll have one with you coming up. We're going to do a far break. I apologize. You're going to go home in Saxas, Chief Asia Bank, Agree Stragis there, Tim Mo. We'll have more from him coming up. Stay with us. Ellie. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all-electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all-electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all-electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Just a few minutes away from the open here as well some analyst actions. Golden coming out with the tech sector here around China, Hangzhou, heck vision cut to neutral, sunny opticals, or raised to a neutral. From the firm here with a $71 price target on a life, Asia is also rated a new buy at Western securities. Here's what look in terms of agenda. Of course, it's day two of the party Congress. We have some briefings coming up. We're still waiting for that trade data. Chips energy reopening stocks green energy very much and focus as well. The open is next. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable.

15407," powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You're watching Blue and Markets China Open. This is the setup here after the person that she used to be is two hours' speech here. We're looking to see if there's any signs that could really kind of help us in terms of direction here in these markets. But it seems to be a downer story across Asia this morning on this Monday. A six times a one percent lower when it comes to the hang saying in the pre-market. Asia's tech is already lower as well and we did see that strongest bias when it comes to that PBOC fix on record. So once we saw dollar China blow past seven twenty I think we have seen a little bit more of that line in the sand and more aggressive action from the central bank here this morning. Of course there's a lot going on here. We're still waiting for that trade data out of China. We have a GDP numbers activity data coming out on Tuesday as well. So there's a lot on plate this week just in itself. But here's what we're looking at in terms of the backdrop. Yeah, the Friday kind of good news or bad news when it came to that inflation print on the U.S. seems to really kind of fade. And this is what we're kind of seeing here that hang over once again hanging out here on the Asia session. CSI 300 Shanghai looking like this right now just lower by about half a one percent. Shen Zhen's very much closely in focus here just given all that rhetoric about she-bound victory in this tech battle after these chip curves out of the U.S. So the China X Shen Zhen tech heavy benchmark there. We're still a lower by about 31 percent. MSI China is down close to 1 percent here this morning. Let's take a look at how effects and rates are looking at given that PBOC fix that we just got there. It looks like the onshore rate. We're still at 719-25 but continue to see that weakness of raw. 721-32 for your offshore rate here this morning. We're watching developers very closely. There was a mix picture, mixed message coming through from she's speech. And no mention of the properties like dirt that whole houses are for living not for speculation that slogan was not in his speech. But if you take a look at the state media full transcript it made its way back in. So what does that mean for some of these properties talks out there as well. Hong Kong's doing this here right now as I mentioned H.S. tech seem to be dragging things lower you have eight shares. We're below 5600 here right now 16,494 for Heng Seng. So the stocks to watch we're focusing a little bit more on the energy sector chips. SMIC is falling for another day. Down to 1 percent we have some passenger traffic numbers coming out from some of these airlines trying to southern scene up there. We saw professors once again on the back of what we've been seeing with oil prices and Quachelle Malta that stock is down some 1 percent after what we got there in terms of their third quarter net income which was seeing some growth there but the market not quite liking that news here H.S. tech movers. So we're looking at here this morning as well just given what we see most of the downside. Only two stocks are up this morning. King D International and JD Health International have expung shares down some 7.5 percent. The EV makers are seemingly the ligers here in NIO's down some 6 percent as well along with VITO and Billy Billy. Let's stick with the China Party Congress now for our morning calls and bring in Annabelle the cover. So the key takeaways from investors you're kind of diving into some of these analyst reports right now post she's speech what are they saying Annabelle? Yeah that's right well as you said that's pretty downbeat as we start the Chinese trading session but given that we didn't see any sort of policy pivot on COVID perhaps that could have been a little bit expected but ING in particular is taking a look at what China",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3693,2022-10-17 01:35:26
15408," trading session, but given that we didn't see any sort of policy pivot on COVID, perhaps that could have been a little bit expected. But I&G in particular is taking a look at what China said, this greater priority that it gave to tech and specifically the development of high tech and the need for greater sustainability given what you were just mentioning there about the US Chips Act and this increasing tech cold war between the two superpowers. But they are saying that given that they do want to become a self-sufficient in the area of tech, then they're going to be needing to spend a whole lot more in this sector, not just on the development of it, but also to try and build out a workforce capable of reaching this policy objective. So as you just mentioned that, China, we are seeing it just a little bit weaker, but still if you just change on now, we can take a look at that run up that we had in to the Congress on Sunday. We're still on nearly 9% higher over the last few sessions. And there was some reaction from HSBC too, in particular with the property sector. Yeah, well you were just mentioning it there as well. What was sort of mixed signals really that came through on the property sector because you had the communicate that came out after, but still the absence of that key phrase, housing is for living that was not in Xi's overall address, that two hours speech yesterday. And so HSBC is saying that that actually could mean that over the coming months, we could start to see a sort of major policy support for the property market, not just looking at stalled projects, but something that is more encompassing for the overall sector. Of course, that would be welcome relief for investors. If you take a look at this terminal chart, we have seen China property stocks slumping around 40% over the past few months of on. All right. Well, thank you so much. Let's bring back Tim Mo there, a Goldman Sachs chief Asia Pacific equity strategist. Focus level on the domestic side of China. I want to focus maybe just more on the macro and beyond what we're seeing in China here right now. You just keep up from the U.S. on a big marketing kind of tour. I have to wonder what they feel about the Fed right now. Just given that this tightening cycle we've seen this resolve from the Fed about, you know, really hiking possibly into maybe until something breaks. Are we starting to see those cracks and where do you think those cracks are becoming from Tim? Well, I mean, the first crack that we've seen is the markets of crack. I mean, I don't mean to make a lot of it because it's actually very consequential, but the Fed's hike is and the way the markets views about that have changed are is is night and day compared to beginning of this year. I mean, just to take us back to January 1st of this year, we in the market were looking for two or maybe three Fed hikes and now the market is pricing 15 and that's that's our view as well. We're looking for 75 basis points in November 50 50 in December another 25 in early February, which would take us to about four point between four four five four seven five market pricing right now is a scooge above that, but but not much. So that that's kind of what's in the market right now. And really what we're doing the bigger pictures where we're getting another we're getting the reenstatement of a kind of a proper discount rate compared to the very flush monitoring environment that we've had for the past decade and certainly for the past five years. And so that's engendering a pretty significant reset. I'd say the one saving grace for Asia, which obviously is the focus of our conversation is that Asia has what we would term pre-traded what is going on in the US. So the US peak S&P peaked on January 5th and is down about 24 25 percent since then Asia peaked in February 17th of last year and is down the broader index is down 40 percent China's down 50 55 or more and and the US ADR's China ADR's are down 71 percent. So I think we've traded earlier and much deeper than than than than what the market's done or what the US market is done. And I think I suggest that there's a bit of already sort of excessive discounting particularly valuations now are 11 times for the earnings 9 times for China 11 times for for the region 9 times for China compared to the US which is derated but is still at 15 16 times earnings. So that suggests to us that kind of more bad news is baked into Asia which might suggest that the risk war is a little bit better if we can see the overall the fed start to stabilize at some point perhaps early next year. What areas of Asia do you think have the the best risk reward then now Tim? Where do you kind of lean towards more towards? I mean if I'm honest a great question I mean where we've been we've been kind of more focused on South Asia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3694,2022-10-17 01:39:49
15409," risk reward then, Naltim. Where do you kind of lean towards more towards? Drew Groud. I mean, if I'm honest, a great question. I mean, where we've been, we've been kind of more focused on South Asia. We went overweight, we went over Indonesia and Singapore late last year. I'm happy we did that because ASEAN has done well this year. And actually, if you look at fun flows in the region, ASEAN has had about 10 billion of net inflows, whereas the rest of the region and most significant in Taiwan have seen very consequential outflows to the tune for Korea and Taiwan collectively, over 50, close to $60 billion of net outflows. But to your point or to your question, given the fact that Korea and Taiwan are down, you know, 40% and China is down 35% year to date, and they're trading at valuation levels that are very, very low, that suggests there could be some much more significant upside as we look into 20-23 if we can see a stabilization in the fundamentals. I'd say if there's one market we'd call out that would have some, we think pretty significant upside, maybe not over the next sort of one or two quarters, but certainly over the next year or plus. That would be Korea. And just a couple of quick reasons. One, valuations are really at the bottom of the range. Our pet statistic is that if you line up 30 markets around the world, Korea is number one as far as the percentage of the market trading below book. So 55% of the market increase trading below book value. And that's really the high end of its range, also high compared to 30 other markets. So, you know, for that and a few other reasons, we think that Korea has a potential to stabilize. But we're really need to see the outlook for the tech sector specifically for the semicircle start to stabilize. That's probably not going to happen until mid to third quarter of next year, so it might be still a little bit early to dip your toes into that area. You mentioned Korea. It's interesting just what we've been seeing with chips for last week or so with this US chips act. People are saying, you know, Taiwan, Korea could be kind of collateral damage in all this. Does that deepen the bear market in the semiconductor sector? Or do you think that as you mentioned, a lot of this has been priced in? No, I think you have to be realistic and say that it is clearly incremental negative news. We just published over the weekend our revised numbers and we incorporated the lower earnings that our tech sector specialists have flowed through their earnings models. And the bottom line is that we took for the tech sector specifically for 2023 and 2024 earnings for Korea Taiwan in round numbers about 5% out of there. And then if you roll that into the aggregate market, we've taken our numbers there down by about 1% to 2% for the overall market. So for the region, we're looking at 5% EPS code this year and 4% for next. In fact, for Korea Taiwan, we're looking for earnings to decline next year, really because of the greater focus on the tech area. Now, we think the market's already priced a fair amount of that, but I think we would need to see at least some kind of stabilization of the fundamentals before the stocks are going to have a more meaningful lift. All right. So we're going to leave it there. But thank you so much, Jim Mo. Goldman Sachs Chief Asia Pacific Equity Strategist there. Just take a look at what it comes to just these latest lines when it comes to newscorp. The New York Times is reporting that our activists' arena capital management has $150 million stake in newscorp. Of course, we've been kind of looking at the company that wants to split up its media and real estate listings businesses. So what we're hearing is that newscorp and Fox, as they look at this merger proposal submitted by Rupert Murdoch, this activist investor, arena capital, is pushing for a say in the matter. All right. We'll bring you the latest there in terms of markets as well. Actually, things looking a little bit better across some of these greater China benchmarks here this morning. We've erasing some of the earlier losses when it comes to the offshore remin B. Hong Kong is also looking a little bit better as well. You can't quite see it here across GMM, but we are seeing green across here when it comes to Hingson. Actually, we're lower by a third one. It's been pretty volatile. But yes, Shen Zhen, though, flat in these markets here this morning. But here's what it looking at. Hs. Tech, still seeing that. We're pairing off some of the losses. But then again, when it comes to the currency, that's what you're seeing strength now, 718 for your onshore rate, offshore 71988. So we're back below 720 after that very strongest biosome record from the PBOC. Let's go to Vani Quenches in New York with your first word news. Hey, Vani. Hey, Vani. Thank you.

Hey, Vong. Thank you. Sinok says profit for the first nine months of the year, likely more than double, thanks to higher energy prices and record output. Preliminary net income jumped as much as 108% from a year ago, according to a company filing. Sinok did not break out its third quarter results. The company scheduled to release its final earnings for the period on October 27. JPMorgan Chase has reported its highest quarterly net interest income on record at 17.6 billion dollars. The lender also raised guidance for the year as it continues to reap rewards from the Fed's interest rate hikes. CEO Jamie Dimon says U.S. consumers and businesses remain healthy, but he also flagged headwinds from inflation, the war in Ukraine and oil prices, and those who are your business flash headlines. What coming up, UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has set to face fresh market judgment without the backing of the BOE's emergency bond buying program. We have more than that coming up next. This is Bloomberg. We've got the information and insights from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it after bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears. Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. All right, your ethics check here. We're seeing a dollar a little bit on the back foot here this morning, especially against a sterling, 11235. Jeremy Hunt, the next UK Chancellor. A lot of questions about Liz Truss's future as well. The BOE also will step away today. A lot of questions about what's going to happen at 8 a.m. London time when those UK gills open up. What's the market going to do? What's the market reaction going to do? I think when it comes to here, FX in Asia, $148.64. We're inching closer to $150 right now. It's some strength, at least, for the currency in China, a rum and B after what we saw. The strongest bias on record from the PBOC here today. All right, take a look. It comes to what to expect out of UK. Let's bring in David Finney, our Bloomberg FX and rate strategist joining us now. Yaps, the BOE officially steps away today, David. How do you think the market is going to navigate the end of this backstop? Yeah, it's going to be a choppy start to this week, even at the end of the week. The moment that the indications are that the market's reacting positively to the news for Jeremy and me and Hunt said there could be potentially even more U-turns, shall we say, on the mini budget, which is certainly a positive for guilt. So, US yields certainly edging lower. It's a good sign that UK yields may edge lower. Of course, the market hasn't fully opened yet, so the market wants to see that one. It's certainly with pound rallying, again, it's another sign. So, it looks like the market's taken well so far, but there's many more things to come this week. And how does it react by the end of the day? Well, then, more U-turns.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3698,2022-10-17 01:56:59
15413," with pound rallying again, that's another sign. So it looks at the markets taking well so far, but there's many more things to come this week. So how does it react by the end of the day? Are there any more U-turns? And let's not forget we have UK inflation data on Wednesday, which is supposed to see UK inflation rise from 9.9 to 10%. And that's the book pressure back on the guilds. So any rally could be just short term lived, depending what that UK inflation data actually comes out at. All right, David. Thanks so much for that update and what to look out for here today. Obviously, a lot of questions about this trust hunt combo enough to restore confidence or not. But again, UK inflation as David minister that is another event risk here later on this week. Tingle when it comes to markets, it's not looking too good for this Monday morning when it comes to risk assets or a concern, Hs Tech, lower by 1.5%. At least you've seen some strength in the Remden B here this morning, but broadly, you're going to go bull macro movers. A lot of red across the board here this morning. The pound certainly is the outlier as well, but TIEX down some 2% this morning. This is Bloomberg. So you built a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government if the president called you to serve our country? Would you go into government or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. You know, we started out just as a you know, start out consumer company worth thick and research. We got into drug discovery in 2015 and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting and I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is like you should keep, you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in a job, then you should quit. And like frankly, when people leave 23 me, like I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like I want to build out a true consumer empowered healthcare world. Like one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression.

Welcome to the world of decentralized finance Bloomberg's covering all things crypto the people the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays this is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade we did see some pressure on the you and we did see some pressure on futures that is now being reversed running up to 10 o'clock in the morning right here in Hong Kong and Singapore it's 11 a.m. in Tokyo this is Bloomberg markets I'm Richard Salamat with Ivan Ma our top stories this morning a wary start to the week in the markets with stocks lower the dollar easing against G 10 peers traders still on watch though for a possible yen intervention China Central bank holds cash withdrawal via medium term loans for the first time in three months while leaving its MLF rate unchanged it is a bit to boost the economy as president she opens the party Congress with a defiant message on COVID-0 Taiwan and the US tech battle right on going on now we've got of course the fallout from the Congress it continues of course we get the standing committee being announced well formally perhaps in March but certainly we'll get clues at the end of this week looking at also what's going on in the UK more political wrangling there we've got also on top of all this markets falling back here we've got the tie X there 2.2% down 2017 lows being tested here looking at also just a green red screen right across there as well just also on the commodity side of things you can just see that we've had crude oil under pressure once more but it's just rising slightly the moment and we're seeing yields again moving up as a bound bond route continues that's what we have at the moment in equity futures also at the moment just a pointing a bit lower if you will and you know if we have a look at what's going on also out there we've got certainly the CSI 300 and what happens after the Congress and I think we've done some analysis on this haven't we even right and certainly I mean this is what history suggests of what we've seen the past one month performance after the party Congress and it's kind of a mixed bag right 2017 using some decent decent gains 20 2007 was the exception as well what will this year bring as you mentioned at the end of this week that's when you're starting to see the top personnel walk out with she's in pink that might actually give a little bit more directions the mark and a word economic policy is going to go when it comes to COVID zero when it comes to the property market we didn't see any any signs of sort of policy change in that speech that to our speech yesterday as well but maybe some bright spots right when it comes to tech hardware green energy certainly some things that maybe investors can sink their teeth into British and also I mean when we look at the price action thus far you know when you say good news well well one currency which is certainly not having it and having a look at the yen now and certainly having a look at what is the one forty eight this gone past now hasn't it and you know the thing is we're looking at one fifty possibly and then is that a line in the sound that that's a question isn't it because what does the ministry of finance what is a bank of Japan did with a currency which is depreciated by nearly twenty three percent since the start of the year there we go that pair thirty two years we're revisiting that level yep and then we saw the strongest bias on record of the PBOC here today against that Raman B so really leaning against that that really weakness after we saw seven twenty break above that for for dollar China what's the land the same for for the B.O.E. to step in again in the guilt market that's also a big question when you have thirty year yields people are say maybe once we get back to four percent that is that line the same maybe or five percent I should say for the B.O.E. to come in again but certainly a lot to have be happening in the UK when markets open at any am in London time what are you the UK guilt markets going to do on the back what been hearing is you turns you have a new chancellor now a Jeremy Hunt and of course the B.O.E. officially stepping away today yeah,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3700,2022-10-17 02:05:42
15415," London time. What are you, the UK guilt markets are going to do? On the back, we'll be hearing these U-turns. You have a new chancellor now at Jeremy Hunt. And of course, the BLE officially stepping away today. Yeah, absolutely. We're looking at this tax cut reversal in prospect, aren't we? And that is what people are looking at. It was a U-turn of all U-turns by Liz Truss there. New chancellor, Jeremy Hunt from the opposite side of the parties. Well, the left wing of the Conservative Party, at least. There we go. Okay, EBI strategist Mark Ranfield. We've got Macro strategist Mark as well now joining us. And looking first of all here, Mark, what if any is the reaction to that speech by Xi Jinping given it started just about just over 24 hours ago? Just under 24 hours ago? Yeah, there's been so much commentary. It feels like 24 weeks ago. But the market's opening a little bit softer, of course. But in a way, it's not performing, certainly, no worse than the rest of Asia. In a way, China stocks are slightly outperforming some of the other indices in the region this morning, which suggests that traders may have actually been thinking there was going to be even something worse in the statements over the weekend that maybe there was going to be more signs of a clamp down on the tech sector or some other part of the economy. So although it's a relatively dull outlook from the speeches, maybe no worse than the new body was really expecting to see. And we've got a slightly modest risk on move with the US equities slightly higher, the dollars a little bit weaker this morning. So all in all, within that context, the Chinese equities are not really doing too bad. And of course, they've been severely beaten up over the past year anyway. So they're relatively cheap compared to the rest of the world as it is. So it may well be that most of the people that needed to sell Chinese equities have done it already. And they may actually be starting to look ahead to the the announcements of who are those people going to be alongside the president and whether that will be a turning point, whether that will help to boost the economy in the months ahead. Marcus, we're talking about FX here today. Goldman is calling for a dollar yen to grind higher to 150 or just about two yen away from that. Are traders expecting further an invention of the BOJ and will it be enough? I think for a lot of strategies out there. I mean, the view is that the bank, the Japanese authorities are basically coming to slow the depreciation, coming to calm the markets, but they do not have a line to send. Other has been the view for much of the past few weeks. But I think as we approach that 150 level, I think that's increasing chapter in the market that Japanese households are being impacted. As Rich pointed out earlier, dollar yen has dropped by over 20%. Dollar yen has actually risen by over 20% this year. I think as the Japanese households get squeezed, there's talk that maybe it's time that Japanese officials may actually start to weigh these considerations in. And that could be increasing chapter that might be a line in the sand. Marcus, everything looking sterling now. It is just marching higher at the moment on with the 112 handle, 112.35 right now, up about half of 1%. But there are some hurdles. We've got this U term which we just talked about. On top of that, what does that bring? Does it actually bring stability with the Prime Minister, which has been roundly discredited? Roundly discredited. I love the user term. I mean, why could I argue that the one of the biggest support for the pound and yields basically was BOE bond buying support. And that it has effectively ended as of last Friday. So with that removed on all of the picture, I think why could argue that the pound is more a victim of the vicissitudes of the markets. And it's not quite clear yet. What lies ahead that could be possible more volatility at this juncture. Yes, of course, Chancellor Jeremy Han has mentioned that the fiscal plan will be announced at the end of this month. And one will assume that he is more in tune with the fiscal orthodoxy, fiscal consolidation compared to his previous Presidesse. But that said, I'm just increasing top, of course, on whether Trusses position is stable in the government. Basically conservative rules are currently pointing towards a one-year immunity in a sense. But if enough MPs from the conservative party revolve, who knows? Who knows what could be up next?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3701,2022-10-17 02:10:08
15416," and the community in a sense, but enough MPs from the Conservative Party revolt. Who knows? Who knows what could be up next? Mark, chime in. Do you think Jeremy Hunt can earn the trust from capital markets? What are we expecting out of guild markets here today? He's got a very tough job. He's not going to announce his plans until the end of October, which still gives traders a couple of weeks to exploit the differences they see between the fiscal policy and the military policy. And the military policy and the military policy. And aggressive traders will always, particularly in bonds and currencies, they will always lean hard when they think the government hasn't quite made up its mind what it wants to do. And when the central bank is still dithering over whether to raise interest rates by a small or a large amount. We could have the worst of all worlds where the markets really push hard against the bond market yields go much higher. The bank of England needs to come in and do 100 basis points hike when it next meets in a few weeks time and it panics the government into cancelling all of its policies that they announced just a couple of weeks ago. It's a very difficult situation in the near term you would expect to see more pain for the currency and for the bond market. And the bank of England whether they like it or not they're going to have to step in because I'm really markets are something which the central bank cannot allow. And if the markets become disorderly today or tomorrow they'll just have to smooth it out. They just have to bite their tongue and say well it's part of our mandate we have to do it. But in the near term UK assets will need to have a large discount to other major countries because there's too much uncertainty. Well Mark I mean you look ahead and you know it's not just the UK but let's look at Western Europe as well. I mean the the ahead wins during the winter are going to only perhaps get stronger. There's quite a bit priced in already people it's not a surprise to people that's going to be an energy crisis that's been building for some time on already markets have made some adjustment. That doesn't mean to say it can't get worse if the winter is longer and deeper than it typically is then of course market still a got room to adjust to that. But the certain amount of that is already in the price more significantly is the problem with with inflation if if inflation stays sticky on their top side. That's a much bigger hindrance and central banks in most cases are still behind the curve the Fed is now possibly talking about 275 basis points high before the end of the year the ECB may have to respond with something similar. So really the battle against inflation is really the significant one and there's still a lot of work to do on that front. Yeah I'm assuming you get the inflation numbers as well this week we come to that in a second. Mark Ranfield Mark is wrong thank you very much indeed. Let's indeed have a look at the week ahead and having looked first of all we've got GDP got this very to a data dump coming up here as well we've got to also the China loan primerate we've got to the MLF as well activity data New Zealand's inflation rate Tuesday when they see UK inflation as well looking here at CPI to come in at a flat 10% the year on year elsewhere. The loan primerate we've got a decision from the Indonesian central bank here as well we've got also this policy address on Wednesday coming through sources say that John Lee may ease property taxes and some visa restrictions and try to curb what has been really going on during the pandemic and the continued. The continued covid restrictions which is in effect grain drain and CPI at the end of the week out of Tokyo and Japan actually and UK inflation is the big one I think especially what it comes to for those guilt traders out there. This week of course it's the US bank earnings after what we heard from Friday Bank of America Goldman Sachs coming up next Netflix and Tesla are also on do here when it comes to the US side of things so that certainly is a big week when it comes to earnings as well is that going to be a driver here to turn around these markets we've been focusing a lot on the macro of late rich. We have indeed and let's have a look at what else is happening because we've got Bonnie Kip Quinn in New York having a look at that first word news. It's not much going on. We're trying to central bank is halted. It's cash withdrawal via medium term loans for the first time in three months. It's a bit debuse the economy as the Communist Party twice a decade leadership congress gets underway. The BVC injected $70 billion dollars Monday via its one year medium term lending facility matching the amount ensuring this month the rate on the MLF was left unchanged to 3.4% as expected. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt has declined to rule out delaying by a year the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic weight of income tax.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3702,2022-10-17 02:14:26
15417," As expected. UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, has declined to rule out delaying by a year the Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic weight of income tax. Such a move would amount to another U-turn on a key plank of Prime Minister Liz Tross' mini-budget. Hunt has made clear that calming the markets is his priority and says he intends to show that the government can account for every penny of its tax and spending plans. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can because our long-term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that. The Orphan Union's executive arm is planning a mechanism to curb price volatility in the box biggest gas marketplace. It wants to prevent extreme price spikes and derivatives trading to rein in the region's energy crisis. The temporary mechanism would impose a dynamic price limit for transactions on the Dutch title transfer facility, the benchmark for all gas traded on the continent. Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has won the majority of seats in bi-elections, building momentum in his campaign for an early national poll. Khan was contesting seven of the eight seats in play and with 90% of the vote counted had won five of them. He'll have to resign from all but one seat, but the victory suggests many voters support Khan's political narrative.

Victor Gao from Send the Center for China and Globalization is up with us next to discuss the policy paths ahead. This is the day. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. We have worked with firm resolve to save our national security, vendor dog and defuse the major risks and ensure social stability. We have developed a great energy to modernizing our national defense. That was President Xi Jinping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3703,2022-10-17 02:18:07
15418," We have to build a great energy to modernizing our national defense. That was President Xi Jinping. They're speaking to kick off the China Communist Party Congress as well from where insights we're joined now by Victor Gao, Su Xiao, University Chair, Professor and Vice President. Other Beijing-based think tank the center for China and globalization. Victor, always great to have you on the program. Everyone's going through this two-hour speech that we heard from President Xi. But yesterday, what can we glean from that message to the party? What was it? And how was the speech different from five years ago? First of all, President Xi Jinping's speech yesterday was very important. And right now, as we speak, all the delegates, about 2,300 delegates, are pouring through every line in his speech and trying to add their own insights and input. So eventually, the speech after all the inputs and incorporation of all the other suggestions, and the advice is, for example, we'll become the official party document. I think he talked about CPC itself, for example, anti-corruption, reinvigorational structure, new memberships, etc. He also talked about CPC and China, after all, CPC is the ruling party of China. And the biggest political party in the world with membership almost up to about 100 million members. And then he also talked about China, CPC, and the rest of the world, because China now is truly a global player. Whatever China does, whatever CPC does, will have a major impact on the world at large. Therefore, I think President Xi Jinping's speech and the important points he emphasized would differ from five years ago, for example, 10 years ago, because China has changed. The world has changed, and China now is faced with new challenges and new opportunities. And we really need to analyze the situation at home, as well as abroad, very carefully, to charter the new cause of action going forward in the coming five years. Victor? Victor, as you know, you are from the center for China globalization, how much did he, in your view, talk about globalization? He did mention that he was wanted to promote trade and investment liberalization in advance by Latin regional cooperation. But how much was there for you in that speech? Well, I think President Xi Jinping really emphasized the point that China does not exist in a vacuum. Whatever China does will be very highly connected with the rest of the world. And he is really a strong fan for greater globalization. And rather than, for example, trade protectionism practiced by some other countries, this gives hope for all of us that China will be more integrated with the world, and China will stand firm to open up more to the outside world. For investments, all kinds will be highly welcomed in China, and Chinese investments abroad will really intensify in the coming five years. It is difficult when there is still a lack of clarity on zero COVID, and when China feels comfortable enough to open up to the world, Victor. And it is a lot to a lot on certainty in the markets as well, and the economy. Is this more of a public health issue than a political one? There is a narrative out there that if President Xi Jinping consolidates his power and masses power after this party, Congress, he can focus a little bit more on COVID-0 and relaxing these relentless restrictions. Do you subscribe to that view? No, I don't. Allow me to make a very clear clarification. First of all, every country has its right to work out its own plans to deal with the pandemic. China is not an exception. China has embarked on very different ways. That is the dynamic zero COVID practice, which has saved as many people in China from deaths or infections from the pandemic as possible. And all honesty, China's record in fighting of the pandemic is the best in the world. And China has demonstrated its mobilization resources and capabilities and the general support of the people and also the commitment of the party and the government in really saving as many people as possible. So in this way, the zero COVID policy will remain. However, it doesn't mean it will not be further modified.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3704,2022-10-17 02:22:55
15419," and in really saving as many people as possible. So in this way, the zero COVID policy will remain. However, it doesn't mean it will not be further modified. I'm pretty sure after the 20th Party Congress, the quarantine times, which now stands at 7 plus 3, probably will be reduced. Victor, fundamentally, I mean, we've had countless numbers of guests point to the damage being done to the economy and perhaps even China's place in the world. This is a huge cost. How much pain is this policy likely to actually cause? And how much is the cost that the authorities will endure with it? Two points. One is that China's official position is that if you look at the overall total cost, for example, from the very beginning of the pandemic up to today, China's overall cost is actually very low, mainly because China has a system which will spring to actually whenever infections are detected and take resolute measures to make sure that the infections do not spread around among the Chinese people. That will ensure greater clarity and certainty in whatever you do. You do not need to worry about the pandemic getting out of control. And then lots of people getting infected and many people probably will lose their life. That's one way to look at it. The second thing is that China now remains the most viable and dynamic center of production in the world. And China went into the zero-covid policy with full knowledge that it will cause inconveniences and hassles and costs. However, it still choose saving people first as the top priority. I hope you will realize that this is how China views human rights, saving people and saving their lives is the most important core element of human rights as we see it in China. And on that note, thank you very much, Victor. Victor Galer, Su Chiu, University Chair Professor and the Center for China and Globalization. We've got equity markets on the way down, I'm going to tell you what is going on market-wise, all that more. This is Bindak. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all-electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy, the electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all-electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all-electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions. And if we can do it in all buildings, we'll reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3705,2022-10-17 02:26:46

The lender also raised guidance for the year as it continues to reap rewards from the Fed's interest rate hikes. CEO Jamie Dimon says U.S. consumers and businesses remain healthy, but he also flagged headwinds from inflation, the war in Ukraine and oil prices. The city's push to improve profitability and its trade business put a dent in revenue which declined about 7% in the third quarter. The Fed's battle against inflation also took a toll on city groups Wall Street operations with fees from investment banking falling 64% in the quarter and revenue from stock trading dropping 25%. OK, let's have a look at some of the moving parts of these markets. And certainly if you are a tech washer, we're seeing more pressure. Alibaba down 3% even though it could be buying back stock here could be buying back $65 billion more shares. Good match, Tencent in that endeavor. A lot of focus of course, naturally on what they had to say, of course, what they should be able to say because they did a vow victory in this tech battle after those U.S. chip curbs. We're not getting any relief here. Quick word on also what's going on with the price action elsewhere. And here we go. We're going to lower Taiwan's heavies down for 3% further.

Bloomberg ETF RQ Monday on Bloomberg. All right, just getting breaking your circle from Wall Street Journal, Goldman Sachs in the mix of it is going to be combining its flagship investment banking and trading business into one of the companies that have been talking to them with familiarity with the matter. They're also emerging asset and wealth management into one division as well. It's a big shake-up taking place. One of the biggest reshuffles is the Wall Street Journal saying that we've seen in Wall Street in the firm's history. So a lot of questions about what this means in terms of the shake-up and what the make-up is going to be for the senior leadership. So at least a few executives will have new roles, according to sources that have been talking to the Wall Street Journal. So certainly one to watch here. NACMAN, we're learning Mark NACMAN, the firm's co-head of trading, will slide over to help run the combined asset and wealth management arm. That's the latest there from the Wall Street Journal.

On top of that, of course, we're looking at the yen, which is testing lows. 32-year-low at the moment. And we're looking at 150s, another line in the sand, possibly even. Right. Let's talk a little more about Xi Jinping, President there with that two-hour speech yesterday in the Communist Party Congress, touching on key points, including COVID-0, Taiwan, and the economy. We've put the people and their lives above all else, and to naturally pursue identification policy, brought about a historical rise in China's economic strength. The central government, exercises overall jurisdiction over the special and administrative regions, as prescribed by China's Constitution, and basic law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and ensure that Hong Kong is administered by patriots, resolving the Taiwan question, is a matter for the Chinese. A matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never promise to renounce the use of force. We must meet obstacles and difficulties head on, ensure both development and security and dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead. All right. Xi Jinping there, opening the once-in-five-year Communist Party Congress. We are waiting for this week, at the end of the week, the top personnel changes. If any, of some clues there as well.

Shuley, I'll start with you. Why do you think this party Congress is so important and what are the key takeaways for you? This is the Communist Party's party, and it happens every five years. The Communist Party is going to advocate to the whole nation and the world. Why it's the right party to rule China and what its vision for the future is. And also, we know President Xi Jinping is very secretive. He keeps the cards to himself. And then this party, this speech is interesting because we can see what is ticking him and the what's on the top of his mind, especially if we compare this. But surely everybody is reading this speech, reading every nuance, possibly every kind of verf, allegory also, possibly within it, and they're coming up with different versions as to what it actually meant. I mean, it's like, it's supposed to criminology. Yes, it's a lot of party ideology. And if you're on the left, you see the left side, on the right, you see the right side. So it is kind of hard to read. It's very, very high level. But I must say that the UK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3707,2022-10-17 02:35:58
15422," A lot of party ideology and if you're on the left, you see the left side on the right, you see the right side. So it is kind of hard to read. It's very, very high level. But I must say that you can hear from President Xi Jinping's tone what his passion is. Basically it's geopolitics and technological competition with the US. Paul, what should the markets look at in the speech? If any. I think overall, you know, the market takeaway judging by what the stocks are doing this morning is a bit, not that impressed really. You know, I think what she was saying right at the end of the clip, we're going to have to dig deep is really, you know, kind of investors take away. It's like, this is a tough time. This is a difficult moment and it's going to take a while to get things going again. There wasn't anything for investors to get excited about in terms of their exit from COVID-0. There wasn't a great deal of reassurance on the property front either. Well, nothing. No, nothing much at all. No, so. I think it meant you things. People were waiting for, but could have given a little bit more of a shove, a little bit more positive momentum. And so we're down a little bit in the stock market again today still in that kind of doldrums position at the moment. But if I may add, so that this speech is very formulaic and it's very high level ideological. The first section is the achievements and President Xi Jinping did talk about COVID-0 to contain a pandemic. But interestingly enough, in the local high session, he didn't mention COVID-0 because if he did, we'll have that until 2027. Even on a night we're covering that, this speech yesterday. We thought that the first sort of 15, 20 minutes was all about security as well. Yes, that was basically him talking what the Chinese Communist Party have achieved for Chinese people. That was the first 15 minutes. I was going to ask you something about the property market. No mention of that. You don't get that typical narrative or slogan of houses are for living in, not for speculation. You have people in the market thinking maybe the fact that that was taken out, at least since Xi's speech. In a way, in the state media full transcript, that maybe there's some flexibility there, that maybe policy could be coming on that front. What? No news is good news. Kind of like that, right? Do you think the crack down the real estate sector would be less of a factor in the short-term maybe? I think so. I mean, looking at his speech, he was fully focused on the US, the Jossal with the US, right? And let's be honest, he has cracked down all the developers at the big tech. I mean, what's else left there to crack down? I think what Xi Jinping is saying there is absolutely right. That divergence trade, the decoupling is just going to carry on going, right? If there's one big takeaway, you know, after the US imposed those extra rules on the chipmakers last week, you know, the message coming straight back from China is right, we'll do it our way, we'll do it on our own. You know, so when you're thinking about how you approach investments from China, these are the US from now on, you're really thinking about more of that separation and more of that trend continuing. But, you know, that's sorry. It was a big... Can I just add one thing, I think what's affecting the China market is there are three factors, regulatory crackdown, COVID-0 and geopolitical tension. The first two might ease in the next five years, but like what Paul was saying, the geopolitical tension would be very, very bad. And a lot of US companies and pension funds, SM managers, they might have to decoup all from Chinese investments. Well, decoupling is one of those things and the other economic risks perhaps are not addressed either, because they were alluded to more than anything else. Yeah, well, so I think to take that thought one step further, you know, really the market is into this US supremacy kind of a sort of trading theme at the moment. The dollar, pre-eminent, really against everything else out there has been mighty strong this year, just carries on going the US equity market. You know, we heard it from Biden himself over the weekend talking about how strong the US economy is and, you know, everybody else is basically going to have to deal with that and that. You know, it's been the training narrative for this year in markets. And I think everyone was so questioning what happened last week when you had this US inflation print, it was hot and then everything sort of went up. And then now we went, we're kind of cutting back lower here. Is it just kind of another bear market rally that we're talking about? Yeah, for the US stock market, it's very difficult. Yeah, it feels like it, though, doesn't it? It's still that pressure on because the Fed is still so serious about raising interest rates. We heard Bullard, he's not ruling out the 75 basis points in December as well, you know, just that aggressive tightening pace going to carry on going. So yes, you're right. The strength in the US really comes through more than anything else in the dollar, but the equity market is going to suffer as a kind of flip side of that. Just got this headline, China to expand domestic demand, continue to deepen reforms. Now, what does that actually entail in life?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3708,2022-10-17 02:40:54
15423," Flip side of that. Just got this headline, China to expand domestic demand, continue to deepen reforms. Now, what does that actually entail? I'm just throwing you under the bus here. And I think it's going to be... Globalization has undergone headwinds in... This is the ADRC talking about these people. Yeah, I think her... I mean, if President Xi Jinping does want to jostle with the US, he has to make sure China does have some money. If it's pocketbook, right? They have to let the regulatory crack down ease and co-visero ease. Well, very quickly. How would the Fed look at this? Yeah, well, it's going to be an interesting one for them to try to jostle with, but so far, they've been saying we're completely focused on the US economy. We're not worried about that global state of mind. So, you know, get on with it, and we'll deal with our internal problems and with inflation, which is the number one priority for the Federal Reserve policymakers. Well, great to have you. I know you're going to hear for the next few days, so we'll definitely have you back here in the studio, Paul Dobson and Shirley Renn from the World of Opinion, joining us here as well. Just want to recap those lines. These are some of the party Congress briefings that are happening here already, day two of this week. This is from the NDRC. Zhao, speaking about this expand domestic demand, continued to deepen reform, and globalization has undergone headwinds in the past periods. So, kind of echoing what we heard from the President talking about these tempestuous storms that are looming as well, hostile environment, the light here, but certainly we'll continue to see what else comes out from some of these briefings here in Beijing. It does have Paul here. It comes here because, of course, we've had some of the restrictions lifted here in Hong Kong. Yes, the S&P was talking about maybe. Yeah, but anyway, that's just... Opening with China, Hong Kong, we do. Well, that is the subject lessening these restrictions here in Hong Kong. Have our first word news, Vodiquin, is in New York. Yeah, let's get some more details. Rich, Hong Kong media of words saying China may further relax the sport restrictions by year end. The South China Morning Post cites Hong Kong's deputy to the National People's Congress down in committee saying the current seven-day hotel quarantine period could be cut to four days. Saying how daily also reports that the mainland may allow more visitors to cross the border from Hong Kong each day. The Australian government will reportedly pledge six billion US dollars for infrastructure projects in its October budget. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told news agency AAP that the spending would create jobs and unlock growth and productivity. Treasurer Jim Chalmer has told us the global inflation fight highlights the importance for Australia of responsible budgeting. We can't have in budgets spending which is excessive or poorly targeted. If we have money spraying around in all directions in budgets, that will make the job of our independent central banks that much harder. And so our intention is to provide some cost-delivng relief that has an economic dividend by which I mean it won't make the inflation problem worse. A delayed statement from G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bankers has laid bare divisions on issues, including Russia's war in Ukraine and Waste a Deal with Climate Change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions, but cash is between major nations meant that this time it took three days. A senior White House official says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Riyadh after consulting with lawmakers after November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production.

First, I'll be meeting Chinese artists and dissidents by wayway and I'll talk to the novelist and political scientist, Elif Schaffert. Tune in to watch those who shape our world, explain how the world shapes us. This is Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quickshake. There we go. We've got an outlier. There we go. The middle of the market is Cheng Green in a sea of red. We've been witnessing, however, public markets. They've been in term of a private market to be alive and well venture capital deal making in Southeast Asia, for instance, continue to grow in the first half of this year. According to data analytics company Prequind, the region recorded about $8 billion in deal values as of May. Global headwinds though could make investors more cautious as they face increasing inflation interest rates in the risk of recession. Let's discuss this with more with Ahmed, a non-founding partner of jungle ventures, which has a billion dollars in assets under management. Ahmed, thanks so much for joining us. Obviously, public markets are a bit in a state of flux here right now. How do you think this is actually impacting just sentiment when it comes to private markets, deal making, investment process, the like? Hey, morning guys. Good to be here. I feel like everybody in the venture capital world is is like an F-15 today that is sitting in the pit stop lane. Everybody's just brought their cars back in everybody's waiting, which started put on. They're all looking at each other. Everyone's got a lot of firepower. Everybody's got a lot of understanding that these are 10 year or 12 year horizon. So these these current midterm or short term volatility should necessarily not impact the market. But I think it's it's just looking at the leader. The United as soon as there's a leader who starts reinvesting back, I think everybody's going to jump in. But that's I guess the but give me a sense of how difficult it is at the moment to perhaps be raising money there at the moment. I mean, we're seeing interest rates of course going up. So the end of free money is upon us and on top of that, we do have a bit of liquidity squeeze. I think it's a miss. You know misunderstanding about the venture capital asset at class. It's it's probably not as directly correlated to the inflation rates. The reality is most of the investors in venture capital as an asset class are ever green. We're all going in with the view of creating growth opportunities. So the next 10, 20 years, not necessarily in the short term over the next one, two years. In fact, if anything, I think an inflationary environment is very good for technology companies. You know, when you're looking to get more bang for the buck, you need to be able to differentiate. You need to be able to accelerate your way to either a consumption market or a business market and technology and startups are you way there. So I think this is going on in the mid to long term be significantly beneficiary for venture capital. You know, given that capital markets are, I guess you could say effectively close for the time being, how are you and I'm advising your portfolio companies and navigating through all this right now. There's definitely been an impact there, especially on the mature end of our portfolio and I'm sure across our peers. We have three companies that had publicly declared.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3710,2022-10-17 02:48:49
15425," There's definitely been an impact there, especially on the mature end of our portfolio and I'm sure across our peers. We have three companies that had publicly declared their intention to go list in 2021, 2022. And now that certainly is pushed out of 2023, 2024, if not maybe later, depending upon when these rates become green. So certainly there has been an impact. I think the good news is that two out of these three companies are in our portfolio at least are profitable already. So there is a less pressure on them unless they need capital for strategic reasons for expansion of products from markets and then they have to go and raise. Another thing which is coming back for these companies is really opportunity for debt, both in terms of venture debt but also just in terms of the banks. These companies have become profitable and that makes it very, very interesting for the extra writers. I mean, give us, you've got a list of investments you've just made and they're, you know, it pid, it do appear. They're quite a few. I like the name of this company, Vietnam based electric vehicle, but I go that bike. Which one of you most excited about it? It gives a sense of, you know, two or three of them and why you've invested in what you hope to get from them. Yeah, I was going to say, Risha, don't ask me to choose which kid I love more. But let me, let me start with that bike that you did bring up. You know, it's one of the most exciting opportunities for me just purely because it's not one of those industries in which you can get to 1%, 5%, 10% market share in terms of technology as a percentage of overall industry and feel good. The reality is that if you and I and our kids have to live in a better world that entire industry has to 100% transform to electric. And that's an opportunity that a lot of local and global players are going to know Vietnam, Southeast Asia, India are very, very large to be the markets. And you know, here's a company, indigenous company that has produced technology to be able to to have an electric vehicle to be alert that runs faster than a gas bike. So what better can the youth ask for? You just also raised some money, 600 million dollars to back early stage startups in India and Southeast Asia. Give me a little bit more clarity and color about just kind of where you're deploying that money and how you're approaching deals now on it. It's interesting. I think we've seen a lot more inbound from the early growth companies that are looking for early growth capital. We've definitely bottom feeding here, but we've seen good quality teens thinking that they need a little bit more, a lot of confidence in terms of capital support. A little bit more to make sure that they can tie it over a little bit more for either a product or a geo expansion. So quite a lot of other investments have been in that early growth stages where the product market fit is there. And we're not afraid of investing in Kpex. We are not afraid of investing in resource allocations for growth. And that's the nature of our investments. It's been interesting. Vietnam, Indonesia, India, you know, all these markets are growing rapidly and taking a lot of investments. Great to have you. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm in and on there from jungle ventures. We got plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg. Music Music Music Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in.

Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. All right, some breaking news now when it comes to Toshiba. This what has been looking at a potential takeover of the biggest bound age of this year. Set free facing some delays according to our sources here as banks are getting wary on the financing we're hearing that Toshiba is said to set that November 7 deadline for financing commitments but it seems like some of these companies are kind of slipping behind schedule because of some obstacles here when it comes to those commitments. So the consortium led by Japan industrial partners and that rival group led by the Japan investment corp will find it hard to meet that deadline now according to our sources. They can't complain about the cost of financing in Japan anyway. That's one thing. All right, well we keep tabs on this. Not necessarily going to get you up to speed with this other story which is emerging from the Wall Street Journal now. It's reporting that Goldman Sachs is planning to combine its flagship investment banking and trading businesses into one with reorganization said to be announced within days. So Keenan has what's the basic sketch here? Well, this is a major reorganization that the Wall Street Journal is reporting. Signing people close to the matter and it's interesting that it's breaking just days before Goldman is to report its earnings. We should also point out that as the Wall Street Journal states this would be one of the biggest reshuffles in the firm's history. According to the report Goldman Sachs planning to combine its flagship investment banking and trading in a one unit and we should point out again these are the two areas that Goldman is known for and the seat of massive profits. They also plan to merge asset and wealth management into another unit and Marcus Goldman's consumer banking arm will be part of the combined unit just last week. Bloomberg reported that the CEO had great plans David Solomon to make markets into the consumer retail giant and bring Goldman into more of the banking retail world but it's a plan that had to be ditched because of the shares which are now down some 20 plus percent and shareholders really wanting a better return on investment. A third division is going to be House of Transaction Banking, the Bank's portfolio of financial technology platforms specialty lender Green Sky and its ventures with Apple and General Motors. Again this is all according to the journal so to sum it up they're taking the bank and putting all the units into three major divisions. The reorganization as the report says could be announced within days Goldman said to report its earnings on the 18th or Tuesday here in the U.S. Wednesday and Asia and again a major change for the bank coming at a time that many consider a brutal time for the banks with most bank shares down 20 to 30 percent year to date and investment banking in the earnings reports we've seen so far taking big hits across the board as deals have really declined IPO offerings have declined and so this is a very fascinating change at a time when many banks are saying they need to change with the times back to you. So it's our first to keep it there in New York for us looking at a report about Goldman Sacks. It's looking at equities and this is what we have in the moment. It is a red arrow story setting moment and you've got major currencies as I'm making some gains against the all powerful green bank and of course we're also in the I suppose the the ripples of the speech yesterday.

15427," I suppose the ripples of the speech yesterday. Yep, we're also checking the dong. The Vietnam, they are now the government widening that dollar trading ban to 5% versus 3% here is what we did see that the dong dropped to record low last week as well. We'll have plenty more to come. This is Mumbai. We're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to have a lot of fun. We're going to have a lot of fun. So now you've been at JPMorgan for about 25 years. So now you run one of the most important parts of JPMorgan, which is the asset and wealth management business. What actually is wealth management and how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably but they have distinctions. Asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds. We manage them in mutual funds, we manage them in ETFs, we manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity and the like. And that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JPMorgan. Wealth management is that plus understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We also help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities, their planning, their gifting, the legacy that they want to leave for their families, the 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college. And it's a great insight into people's entire journey. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice of such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3713,2022-10-17 03:01:36
15428," It's almost 11 a.m. in 6.5. Welcome to Blumberg, market Asia. I'm Hustle and I'm in. I'm Rashad Salamad in Hong Kong. This is the top store. He's got to wear. He started the week market, why it's stocks down, the dollar easing against G10 peers straighter still on watch for a possible YEN intervention. The people's bank of China running over policy loans to support the economy as President Xi stands firm on COVID-0 in a defiant opening to the Communist Party Congress+. We're going to head over live to London with financial markets there, say to deliver their verdict on Liz Trump, a trusses attempts at an economic reset that was almost a Freudian slip. Anyway, that's a bit much. And we're seeing pretty much a massive price swings across asset classes on expectations of tighter market policy also. Disappointment out of China, Xi Jinping suggesting no policy change investors were pretty much looking out for that. Taking a look at where we are, in Tim Saffa, those benchmarks here in Asia, the Thaiics extending its decline to about 2.2%. We had Xi Jinping saying that the Taiwan issue will be won for China to resolve. That's not a lay in consensus whatsoever. The ASX 200 index down 1.5%. In the FX space, it really is about the $0.00 easing just a tendency. Some gains in terms of Asian currencies, not the case for the Korean one, not the case for the Taiwan dollar as well. It is down at the lowest level in about five years. I'm the back of those comments from China in the bond market. It is about rising yields. Of course, those bond bulls, suggesting that the higher yields go, the stronger the rally might be in 2023 and in the command space we're seeing pretty much a sell-off in the ION or aluminum as well as net gas hitting oil though up by 1.6% rich. Well, about two days of public holidays on Thursday and Friday in Bangkok. Getting the open now for the set anyway and having a look at what the price action is there and also looking, of course, very closely what the bar is doing, but losing a gaming ground, I should say, against the American counterpart. We've got at the moment 38, but 16 satong buying yourself a dollar. Those really coming against this background of the nation's financial markets reopening. After that two day holiday we also got policy clues from the Bank of Thailand's quarterly and less meeting, likely a bit later on as well. And looking at the prospects of the trading day in India, well heading down, repeal looking stable, and that is really your picture, therefore, Thai and India markets. And of course, we had a defiant Xi Jinping opening the Communist Party Congress, reaffirming policies that are the centre of frictions with the US. Let's get more on Xi's speech and to get to Stephen Engel, who's our chief North Asia correspondent. Now, you know, we did this yesterday, this time yesterday, and what stood out for you because it maybe what wasn't mentioned, which actually did stand out by its admission. We've been digesting this for 24 hours now and you know, you're trying to read the mood and trying to read the messages between the rhetoric, obviously. And on Friday, somebody asked me, what is going to be the market implications of his speech? And I kind of went, eh. And I was asked to come back today with better analysis than, eh. But again, it's kind of a met response on the markets because he didn't necessarily add or change any of the short-term policies that are in place that are really dampening economic growth right now. COVID-0, he's sticking to it, not giving a time frame for which to exit that. And he didn't even mention the woes in the property market. Now, I have digested this for the last 24 hours. So I'm going to turn over to Wong Tao over at UBS, the chief China economist. She knows far better than I. And she put out an email just a couple of minutes ago, essentially hitting the key points. And on COVID, she does not expect imminent changes to the current COVID policy. Our baseline forecast is that the restrictions will be eased significantly after the NPC. You know when that is held. March. So buckle up, you're going to be having COVID-0 according to Wong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3714,2022-10-17 03:06:28
15429," The forecast is that the restrictions will be eased significantly after the NPC. You know when that is held. March. So buckle up. You're going to be having COVID-0 according to Wang Tao for a little bit longer on the restrictions. Then we could see some sort of easing afterwards on property and the potential for easing, generally speaking, she says we are no specific mention of the property downturn or near-term economic policy. We expect the sub-tune recovery in this current Q3 and continued downward pressure in the property sector to renew more peace-meal easing measures similar to what we've seen in recent months. So there really wasn't this catalyst from the speech yesterday to drive markets. It's more of a long-term speech that he gave. We, of course, Taiwan, geopolitically at center stage there as well, and say that they wouldn't rule out the use of force. Well, that's similar verbose that they used in the past. He says Taiwan must be reunified and can be realized, that reunification. And he essentially did not rule out the use of force. And that has been their view. And it was kind of a play-the-long game still on that. But adding a little bit more urgency, you know, we had economists come on here and opinion columnists come on here and say he seemed angry, deep down, kind of a bubbling resentment for the bullying tactics he perceives coming from the United States. Not only in chips and semiconductors and high-tech products being sold to China or being banned from being sold to China, but also overall on the Taiwan issue. Steve, whether it's air or may, I mean, China did say that it will continue to open up. It will continue to attract FDI wants next. What are we looking out for? Well, for the Congress, what we're looking out for is the big revelation, the reveal of the Standing Committee next Sunday. So in six days' time, the Party Congress ends on Saturday and then we will get those seven Standing Committee members of the Politburo, supposedly the all-powerful Standing Committee. They're supposed to be ranked equals with Xi Jinping at the top. But they're not really equals now that Xi Jinping essentially has changed the Constitution, abolishing term limits for the top guy himself. And he will almost, you know, surely get that president's defying third consecutive term. Who he places or who he's allowed to place in the other Standing Committee positions will be what we're watching out for from the Congress. If he stacks the deck with all loyalists, it's going to be the next at least five years, potentially even longer, of absolute rule from Xi Jinping. All right, Chief North Asia correspondent Stephen Angle, how do you trade all of that? Let's bring in our guest, Stephen Davis. Steve Davis, founder and CEO of Jowling Weld Management. Steve, could you have your with us? I mean, we have from Steve. No change. It is about continuity. How do you trade that? You don't. I mean, it's usually is. A case of still continuing exactly what we've seen for really the last couple of years, which is a lot of policy driven changes which have affected markets negatively and no changes to those policies. So therefore you expect to see a continuation of what we've been struggling with all year. Don't trade that. If you were to hazard a guess, the next 10% will it be up or down? I think it'll probably be up, but it's a question over what time frame. The speech was remarkable from one perspective, which is going to be a continuation of the status quo. So that means, as Steve Engel was saying, a longer term gradual recovery, perhaps from fairly oversea, oversold levels, but clearly the market is not a priority. But geopolitics could send the markets in a spiral downwards and very quickly. And that is the focus for Xi Jinping right now. That is correct. And obviously it's popular in the United States from an election perspective to appear to be tough on China. Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan relatively recently and sparked off the latest round of rhetoric and tension. It doesn't look as though that's going to go away anytime soon. And it's obviously going to be a feature in the presidential election in 2024. So China is a popular bugbed for the Americans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3715,2022-10-17 03:10:59
15430," So China is a popular bugbed bath for the American political system to be nasty too. So Steve, I mean, look at Europe, the headwinds are the economic problems that they are just mounting the whole time. You look at EM, there's a seem, you know, there are the best of what the dollar does in many ways. So where do you actually invest? I mean, the US seems the obvious one, but what's going on there too? Well, exactly. So the environment at the moment is if you've got cash, sit on cash, looking for those opportunities. But yeah, I mean, we've got a whole host of different headwinds from an economic perspective. It's the strength of the dollar driven by US interest rates. And that's not going to change any time soon because those interest rate differentials are going to remain if not increase. So I think the big issue is, is what cracks first? Is it going to be inflation coming under control? Or is it going to be something that we didn't expect? We had a little bit of a foretaste of that in the UK, guilt market, which is obviously driven by higher interest rates. And that had a knock-on effect to the market to which the government belatedly has responded. So all of those sorts of things will start feeding out into different markets at different times. So the central bank will, the central bank's blink on their battle against inflation in order to protect the system. Well, I can't, it kind of depends on how bad systemic risks can get. At the moment, they're sort of bubbling along in background, but they can push themselves into the foreground pretty quickly. Steve, when you look at the fixed thing, look at the bond markets. You're getting a good yield, but you could be catching a falling knife, given what's been going on. Some of these investment grade corporate bonds have gone into high yield now, become junk. Does this present an opportunity? It does. And if we look back to 2008-09, it was actually the fixed income markets, which were the ones that rebounded most quickly and most immediately. And hit that sort of previous high levels more quickly than necessarily was the case with the equity markets. So you're quite right, is that yields are beginning to look extremely attractive. Back in 2008-09, the projected default rates bore no relation to the actual default rates that came through over the course of the following 18 months. So yes, that is an area where I think there's good potential, but you've got to get a better indication from the Fed and other central banks that they are reaching the tail end of their tightening regime. And we haven't got that yet. If you're looking beyond the looming recession, would you be buying the dips in US stocks and bonds? Because the US seems to be the one that will emerge the winner at the end of the day. I think that's true. I think that there are opportunities. But at the same time, what we have not yet seen is a crack in earnings expectations. So market valuations don't look outstandingly cheap and they don't look outstandingly cheap on the basis of current earnings forecast. So the next quarter earnings figures, which are going to be starting during the course of this week, are going to be pretty important indicated to that. Before we let you go, we've got to talk about the pound. That reversal. Is that sustainable or not? Well, it would appear so. They've belatedly realized the economic orthodoxy is orthodox for a particular reason it's worked. And at the same time, you can't announce a bunch of unfunded tax cuts. So hopefully as a result of more steady hands and a bit of more consultation, we're through the worst of what's been happening for both sterling and the UK market. All right. We continue to monitor developments there. Steve Davis, Jellyn Wealth Management. Now let's get the first word news with Bonnie Quinn in New York. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Haslinda. Thank you. UK Chancellor of the X-Jakery Jeremy Hunt has declined to rule out delaying by a year. The Prime Minister's plan to cut the basic way to income tax. Such a move would amount to another U-turn on the key plank of Prime Minister Liz Trosses mini budget.

15431," I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those taps cuts as I possibly can because our long-term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that. A delayed statement from G20 Finance Minister and Central Banker is has laid bare divisions on issues including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions but cash is between major nations meant that this time it took three days. China's Central Bank has halted its cash withdrawal via medium-term loans for the first time in three months. It's a bit deboost the economy as the Communist Party's twice a decade leadership congress gets underway. The PBOC injected $70 billion dollars Monday via its one-year medium-term lending facility, matching the amount of maturing this month. The rate on the IMF was unchanged at 2.75% as expected. A senior White House official says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Riyadh after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg a quick take. Powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries and Bonnie Quinn, this is Bloomberg. Rich. Thanks for coming to our former Reserve Bank of India deputy governor, Arama Gandhi joining us to discuss the Central Bank's concept note on a digital currency and the country's economic outlook. But first, a report says Goldman Sachs is preparing for a massive reorganization, including merging its flagship investment banking and treading businesses, details just ahead. Keep it here with us. This is Bloomberg. You know, we've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that but you know, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall and estimates are a trillion dollars a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates is not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. All right, US futures pointing to a higher open S&B futures up half a person.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3717,2022-10-17 03:19:16
15432," All right, US futures pointing to a higher open, S&P futures up half 8 percent. That's on the back. Of losses which we saw just on Friday. Well, top executives from some of Wall Street's biggest banks have flecked the risk of a downturn in the US economy as earnings season gets underway. Have a listen to the CEOs of J.P. Morgan, C.D. and Morgan Stanley, following their results. This is a possibility of a mild recession. We could well see a mild recession in the second half of 23. We haven't seen clarity around inflation abating. My guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year. And I think the Fed will be successful in this journey. There is still, for example, a possibility to be short-wind. We believe the US economy is well positioned to expand it, all else being equal in the geopolitical arena that is. I would not change my possibilities in this quarter versus last quarter. Well those bank earnings coming out that get to see Keidon in New York and despite the warnings, the overall message is things are okay. And the word mild recession was used by several of them. It seems like they got their act together and decided that the verbies they were going to use. It does seem like a glass half full of forecasts. There was a headline from Barons that pretty much summed up what we saw Friday from these big banks. Bank earnings weren't terrible and that may be enough for investors. Unquote. That really does sum it up. The bank earnings kicked off Friday for the biggest banks. And we all know it's been a brutal year for the banks, especially investment banking that deals are down. There's no IPOs. And so the earnings reports in that perspective were okay. And let's take a look at how they ended the Friday session. A lot of green on the screen because two of the banks, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan actually beat results. You look at the year-to-day performance of these stocks and you can see the pain we're talking about. City, for instance, from quarter to 25% profit decline, citing challenging markets. Revenue was up 6% investment banking revenue down more than 60%. Wells Fargo's surge was driven by the fixed income revenue but there were costs tied to the scandal. And let's look at JP Morgan because year-to-date their stock has been under pressure. But their profit strength, but Jamie Dodden saying US customers are healthy and he cheered investors by saying they may even be able to buy back stock early next year. It are 9.7 billion in the third quarter. A 17% drop from what it made a year ago. That's had quarterly revenue rose to nearly 33 billion. They had record net interest revenue. And so it's been a mixed assessment going forward of the global bank. Very quickly to Morgan Stanley, it missed on equity trading, beat on fixed income. That really seemed to be a strength for a lot of these banks as the fed raised rates. But they've indicated they are going to have headcount under review which is signaling there may be job cuts in the offering. Many of these banks have said cost-cutting is something that is very important and so that would only make sense at this juncture. Next in the queue, Bank of America, what are we looking at? Bank of America, it has delivered some of its best earnings so far. There's a lot of focus here on positive growth and revenue. They reported that long before others also about their loan growth. The NII revenue from customer loan payments minus what the company pays to pausers expected to total 13.6 billion. That would be up from 12.4 billion in the second quarter. Let me put one billion last year, Mike Mayo, a Wells Fargo analyst on banking says that NII to the sky appears to be the mantra for this. Goldman Sachs revenue and profit made a client from a year ago, they're reporting on the 18th. And Sue, Wall Street Journal reporting that Goldman may be planning to combine his flagship investment bank.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3718,2022-10-17 03:23:43
15433," from a year ago, they're reporting on the 18th. And so, Walcy John reporting that Goldman may be planning to combine his flagship investment banking as well as trading businesses into one unit. I mean, what do we know? Yeah, Walcy Journal out within the last hour, a pretty significant report. And they are saying that Goldman Sachs plans to fold its biggest units into three separate divisions, which would be the biggest reorganization for Goldman Sachs in its history. The headline, of course, Goldman Sachs planning to combine its flagship investment banking and trading into one unit. These are its hallmark divisions. It is where it makes all of its money. It is its calling card. So those two strong areas would become one, according to the Walcy Journal report. They also plan to merge asset and wealth management into another unit. And into that unit, Marcus Goldman's consumer banking arm would be part of that. Bloomberg just last week reported that the CEO had great dreams for Marcus to become part of its domination of retail banking because the stock down well over 20 percent year to date. They've had to back off of that dream. Investors really not happy with the performance so far. And a third division, according to the Walcy Journal, was House Transaction Banking, the Bank's portfolio of financial technology platforms, specialty lender, green, sky, and its venture with Apple and General Motors. The reorganization the journal says could be announced within days. And that would make sense that it perhaps would be part of its earnings conference call because that will be happening on the 18th, just in a couple days, back to you. Goldman under pressure, Bloomberg Sukinen. Thank you. Plenty more ahead. Keep it here with us. This is Mumbai. Bethlehem. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't be electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. The greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. A multi-trillion dollar industry.

But the victory suggests many voters support his political narrative. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Boombaer Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. And Varnie Quinn, this is Boombaer. Grish. All right, Varnie, let's have a look at some of the key events and a data of interest to investors. Certainly Monday we saw the medium term lending facility that just come through unchanged. Looking at this variable data dump choose out of China. We're looking at GDP figures there. Other activity, of course, in the mix. Certainly we're going to looking at some of these industrial production, retail sales, fixed asset investment as well. UK CPI worth watching half for as well. We've got the continuing market terminal in the UK and expecting inflation figures out then. Looking at a rise in the double digit space here, we've got 10% slated by the economists that we've been talking to. New Zealand also with prices in Japan where economists expect an uptick and consumer prices there as well. Meanwhile, there, of course, we'll be seeing on Wednesday, the Hong Kong Chief Executive, John Lee, delivering his first policy address. Sources saying that he may ease property taxes as well as visa restrictions and to try, ready to curb brain drain, which has been, of course, started off by the pandemic and COVID policies. And Rich, as the banking industry deals with a slump and revenue analysts are expecting more weaker earnings in the coming days, Bloomberg intelligence sees US lenders posting the biggest profit decline of any SMP 500 index sector. Bank of America reports later Monday in Gaulman on Tuesday in tech earnings. Netflix could see a turnaround in its stock performance as a streaming company moves into advertising. And meanwhile, Tesla stock has been battered by disappointing quarterly deliveries and COE-Lan Musk's surprise decision to revive his offer to buy Twitter. Now, meantime, over in Washington, D.C., the IMF's first deputy managing director says the weakening yen could pose risks for the Asian financial system if companies or banks have not properly hedge their borrowing. Kitagopinato, Blumbak's Tom Keane, that many nations are in for a rocky ride as they adjust to dollar strength. So, when you have sizable movements in the dollar, it has very sizable implications for the global economy because it's so dominant in trade and finance. But the important thing to keep in mind is that there are fundamentals that are driving these large movements. They seem very quick, they seem very steep. The differences in the path of monetary policy tightening is one factor, the differences in high energy prices are affecting countries is another factor. So, I think this is going to be a bit of a rocky ride for countries, but they will have to adjust to it. So, they have to use their own monetary policy tools to be able to keep inflation. We're going to speak to Robert Rajad here about emerging markets. Let me stay with a major countries with you, Dr. Gopinato. Let's look at the Yen experiment. All of this meeting in the world, John Farrow is transfixed by Yen 147. What is the council of you and your chief economist to the Japanese to extricate themselves from their unique yield curve control experiment? There were fundamental reasons for that particular divergence that we see in the currency. Japan has decided to stay the course in terms of keeping interest rates low, while the Fed has decided to stay the course in terms of raising interest rates very decisively to bring down inflation. And that of course is one of the primary drivers of the different, of the fact that the Yen has lost value relative to the dollar. Now, of course, over time monetary policy will have to figure out what the best course is, depending upon inflation development in Japan, but as of now, I believe, given the diverging trends, you know, currency movements will look like they do now. With all of your expertise, if Japan capitulates to a more normal monetary policy, and Yen goes strong 148, 150, just as a pick a number out of thin air, 129, what will that do?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3721,2022-10-17 03:40:33
15436," Honoratory policy and Yen goes strong 148, 150, just as a pick a number out of thin air, 129. What will that do to the Pacific Rim financial system? We have to look into that and see how, what that happens in a disruptive manner, it happens in an orderly manner, right? We always have exchange rate movements all the time. When you have big movements and exchange rates, the problems that come up is when you have firms or banks that have borrowed multiple currencies and have been sufficiently hedge themselves. Those get affected. But if you hedge yourself, these are movements that you should be using. That was IMF first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath with Blumberg's Tom Keane in Washington, D.C. Well breaking news on Fosan, it has agreed to sell its stake in the parent company of enanching iron and steel and that's according to people familiar with the matter and the price is at 2.1 billion dollars. Fosan of course is one of China's largest non-state conglomerates and according to people familiar say it's disposing its assets for debt repayment. Jiangsu and Shaogun Group is set to buy the stake from Fosan and is asking not to identify discussing the matter. It is a private matter according to people familiar with the matter. Well indeed it's not the only one of course here as well. Let's have a look at the shea. 1.6% is down to the stake over of the company which could be the biggest buyout in Asia this year risk of slipping behind in terms of the schedule they had. The bidding groups are running into obstacles and of course it's down to financing commitments from banks which are being held up right now. We got the consortium led by Japan industrial partners and a rival group led by state backed investment fund, Japan investment finding it hard to meet a debt damage I believe was sent for the 7th of November there as well. All of this coming up according to people familiar with all this global backs. Turning courses of course and particularly over backing large buyouts like Toshiba and of course this is down to rising borrowing costs in the United States and elsewhere but odd enough not really so much in Japan. Okay that's what we have with these two stories as Linda. Alright still to come we're joined by a former deputy governor of the RBI to discuss a central banks plan for a digital currency and its outlook for interest rates. We'll be keeping here with us this is Linda. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative like just be honest we've had sort of a shift in are we in some sort of circulation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday.

15437," India starts trading in about 4 minutes from here and if you're just pointing to a lower open down, 6th and 1 percent, now looking ahead to key stories and vests are watching in India today. An RBI auction will switch 1.8 billion dollars worth of shorter maturity government bonds to longer tenors and shares of electronics might will start trading in Mumbai after its IPO and ACC canfin homes and PVR among the bigger names to report earnings later Monday. Wish. All right. Well, same time we got India Central Bank working towards a phase introduction of a digital currency. The RBI saying it's targeting an account based coin for the wholesale segment and a token based currency. The retail that digital currency will be referred to as the E-Rupee discussing this and more joined by former reserve bank of India, deputy governor Argani who is a current financial sector policy expert and advisor. Is Argani why do you need an E-Rupee? Because there has been quite a lot of interest around the world among the various constituents whether it is the individuals or businesses in alternate forms of currency. So whereas the privately issued virtual currencies do not have appropriate legal backing, authorities have now come to the conclusion that they may have to give a legal alternative for virtual currency. So that is why more than 105 countries in the world are today by seriously looking at introducing a central bank issued a digital currencies. Primarily the interest. Yeah. I want to get a sense of the pros and cons but as your benefits and risks of being a central bank digital currency, CBDC if you will, you know, for an E-Rupee. Yeah. The benefits that is forcing our faster electronic payments as good as the currency, paper currency which gives anonymity so people can have the confidence that they are dealing with a legally given legal changer currency not in physical form but in electronic form. So the speed of electronic payment that is the first great advantage that you get, then the legal support that comes along with it that gives you the additional confidence and trust and more importantly it can lead to financial inclusion. That's the expectation that more and more people will be able to deal through E-Rupee much, much faster and more efficiently. Mr. Gandhi, I want to turn your attention to the Indian economy. The world is concerned about high inflation, slower growth. What are the chances of stack inflation in India, you think? Yeah, now we are super the question away from the E-Rupee. Yeah, the inflation, yes, recent month policy, the committee minutes have clearly mentioned that it has come to stay a little longer. So we have a very strong action against inflation is called for that's why recently they have increased the report rate. So India is going to be growing, it's not going to face this act or anything. So it is a strong economy with the highest stronger economic growth in the current fiscal. That has been general consensus about that both within India and outside also everybody clearly conceives that India will be growing at 7% and that are all. So general consensus that the Fed will continue to tighten might the RBI be forced to go the same way given the weakness in the Rupee. That is definitely one of the influencing factor in determining MPS is the effort that will be there, that will be factor again, but it will be completely guided by the domestic situation. Okay, yes. The even factor movement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3723,2022-10-17 03:49:03
15438," That will be there, that will be factored in, but it will be completely guided by the domestic situation. Yes, the movement rates higher will have an impact on the farthest flows, that will be factored in. That's an interesting differential which needs to be kept. That is one of the underlying, I won't say objective, but certainly, the embassy will be concerned about that. As I said, that domestic strong demand, that will also factor in the balancing out the need for whatever policy action that needs to be taken. When you look at what the monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India right now, how much of it is really devoted to perhaps preserving the value of the rupee rather than actually having much efficacy in terms of what you would get with spending and the likes and depressing certain parts of the economy chiefly inflation? I think the embassy was guided more by the domestic inflation in its multiple policy action which has recently been taken rather than exclusively to maintain the interest rate differential because of the federal rate. That is only an element of that is in making rather than the reason for the policy action. The reason for policy action is to bring the inflation down to the bank within which the legally embassy has been mandated. It has been driven more by that requirement rather than the exchange rate related consideration. The reason I ask some of that is because India has a huge informal sector, does it not? And this black economy, some would call it, is perhaps out of the reach of monetary policy. Would a digital currency enable authorities in India to really deal with that in a more fundamental way than just banning some bank notes as we had a few years ago? The district paper that has been brought out by the Reserve Bank clearly indicates that the by impact of the European on multiple policy that needs to be seen, it is uncertain. There are arguments, there are expectations that people may shift away from physical cash to European or from bank deposits into European. So to what extent that is likely to happen that is not clear yet, no, a president is available anywhere in the world. So that needs to be looked at because people can anticipate that, that needs to be clear as seen. So what extent people have changed their behavior away from physical currency and deposit with bank into European to that extent, Reservant calculations and the entry calculation money supply calculations can be different. So we need to be watching out. Then the other decent element which clearly mentioned that if the European is going to be remunerated by the issue that is by the Reserve Bank, there is one of the policy options that is not isn't yet in case that is what is up at far, then it may have a stronger influence on monetary policy. These are a right now, these are the inferences which are purely purely tentative, nobody can clearly perform up this what will happen. So we need to be watching out. Is growth now a priority for the RBI is supposed to inflation are there any indications of that? About growth. Is growth a priority for the RBI? Not at in the sense that right now RBI and ABC is firmly looking at controlling the inflation giving the top priority for inflation because that is what they are tossed statutorily. Only after bringing in inflation within the reasonable band that time the bank and the NPC would go priority for growth. That's a gondi. Thank you so much for your time from a Reserve Bank of India, Deputy Governor Ard Gondi there.

15440," When I feel like it's a bit of a fool's game, it's a bit of a fool's game now, Haslund, isn't it? To really decide because I think many of us cannot believe what's come over the 41 days that Liz Truss has come into power. But what I do think now is this morning, Liz Truss is going to be waking up and it's the economy that's going to be giving the verdict on her latest screeching U-turn to the economic policy and showing investors as well as MPs and many people in the country are going to be waking up to really watch how the markets are reacting to a new chancellor and to a possible Halloween budget that we have heard of that was going to be announced by Jeremy Hunt in the coming days to see what new policies are outlined and if stability can come back to the country. But the interesting thing is there's still two weeks to go until that happens so where do markets sit in that time? That's right in the meantime though the power and doing a reversal. Blumberg's Lee Ann Garen, thank you so much for that. In the broader markets, well, Asia under a lot of pressure on expectations of tighter monetary policy from here also disappointment. Out of China's mainly read across the board in the FX market, well, the mighty dollar taking a breather. That is it from Blumberg Market, Asia. Favorite Middle East is next, keep it here with us. This is Blumberg. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. Layed on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea still lies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable.

As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. A multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, it has got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ. Monday on Bloomberg. It is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East. Our top stories this morning, China's President Xi opens the party Congress saying the economy is top priority. It gives no signs to investors about any relief on COVID-0 or the property sector. Speculation swirls about Liz Truss' future as Prime Minister, UK Financial Markets, get a fresh opportunity to pass judgment when they open in the next few hours. The new chancellor refuses to rule out more tax cut new turns. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can because our long-term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that. Jim Bullard leaves open the possibility that the Fed could high 75 basis points at each of its next two meetings but says it's too early to make that call. And the White House National Security Advisor says President Biden's options for re-evaluating U.S. side relations include changes to the approach to security assistance with the Kingdom. It's just gone 8am across the Emirates. Very warm welcome to the show. I'm Manus Krani in Dubai. In Hunt, we trust. Or should we add a T? The point of the moment is rolling the dice that Jeremy Hunt, who is the new chancellor, will deliver fiscal probity and assurance, make more tax new turns, fill the fiscal gap that was unfunded and the pound responded with a mediocre rally of just under 1%. Nothing is off the table but today is judgment day for not just the currency but for the bond market, the guilt market was broken which was so free-brought. There is the point over the past six days. Goldman Sachs say that as the dust settles the Bank of England will hike less and sterling is the adjustment mechanism. By the way, he warned. Bailey, Bailey's bluff, of course, he called the political bluff. There's no more backstop from Bailey but is that the case for the Bank of England? They will not hesitate to raise rates. A stronger result than a stronger response than they delivered in August may be needed. Is that enough to stabilize the point and avert a reversion to 103? It's nidier. To the bond market and inflation expectations from the University of Michigan, break above 5%. That blue yields out on Friday. However, we're seeing a small pullback this morning. Bullard will hear more from him later. Leads open the door for a larger December hike but it is premature to talk about pulling forward those hikes that are in the dots. Into 2022 more on the rate debate in a moment. Barclays are going for 75 pips in Nov and deck. And then high fibrill is the risk narrative this morning. Yes, there's a small green print on the equity markets this morning. Let's roll it over. But we capsized on Friday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3727,2022-10-17 04:06:19
15442," High Feebrile is the risk narrative this morning. Yes, there's a small green print on the equity markets this morning. Let's roll it over. But we capsized on Friday, rinsing night the entire week gains, up for 10th of 1% the wealth effect. I like this. I really like this. We've lost $15 trillion in global equities at the moment, almost as much as we lost in the GFC. But the wealth effect, 4% of Americans' wealth has been wiped out. It's the second biggest wipe out of wealth since 2008. A full 10th of 1% of Erali is nothing on a 22, 23% demolition, Darby in risk. Judith Sali, she said a few more hours than I have to put it all together. So hers will be much more fluent. Good morning. Well, let's see, Manus, but yes, certainly that tick up in US equity futures, not very much helping out Asian stocks today. We are back in the red after that very solid rally that we had coming through on Friday. And again, a little bit of a disappointment amidst what we heard from Xi Jinping at the Communist Party Congress. And we haven't really seen too much support coming through in Chinese equities today. We also had the PBOC holding its cash withdrawal, fire its media term loans for the first time in three months. That was a bid to try and boost the economy, but certainly investors today selling out of equities. Watching the $ Sing Dollar there too, we are seeing a bit of strength now coming back through in the dollar. The $ Sing Dollar was higher against the greenback earlier, but we had non oil domestic exports growing 3.1% year on year in September. That was well below estimates. Let's have a look at what we are seeing in the yen as well as we remain on intervention watch. Once again, some verbal warnings coming through. We heard from the official calendar at G20, saying Japan will respond to excessive currency moves. And of course, 150 now in sight, which Goldman is saying will happen quite soon. City we were talking about last week told us you could see 160 for yen to the dollar. If we don't see a change in the yield curve control policy. And Aichi is saying Japan very cautious about intervening without US support. Manus. Jules, thank you very much. Yeah, Dollar yen. It's getting a bit tricky, isn't it? Jules, we'll see you through the morning. At Jules, Sally in Singapore to China. A defiant Xi Jinping has opened the once in five year Communist Party Congress, reaffirming policies that are at the center of the frictions with the United States. For more on Xi's speech, let's bring our chief North Asia correspondent Steven Engel in Hong Kong. Steve, I mean, it's one of the most red stories, you know, it comes in there at number one, two, and five, and six. But what was the standout because he covered many, many issues, but with no pivotal, you turn on anything. That's exactly it. And that's why on Friday, I kind of went, eh! When you ask me what are going to be the market implications this Monday morning, and there's been fairly muted response as Julia just ran through, because he talked in fairly broad brushstrokes, and he did not necessarily talk about a COVID off ramp of COVID-0. And I got an email from the communications teams over at UBS here in Hong Kong, a Wang Tao, a chief China economist, essentially saying, she doesn't see COVID-0 easing anytime before the National People's Congress in March of next year. So, you know, that drag on the Chinese economy, we didn't get any more clarity. He also didn't mention property woes. That's a concern as well, because will there be any stimulus or any kind of resolution to the other big dampening, dampening on economic growth? So investors didn't have a lot to chew on other than the long-term main goal of the Communist Party is economic growth. There was concern that perhaps he would diminish that top goal, which has been in place since 2002, and replaced more by national security. Well, he did spend much of that speech talking about national security, but again, he stated that high quality growth will remain the paramount priority. And in terms of Taiwan, I mean, again, very much affirming his dominant position relative to the U.S. It's still on a unification trajectory. It's the timing that one has got to question, is it? Yeah, the timing. I mean, there was nothing necessarily new, but there does seem to be an urgency in Xi Jinping's voice. A sugary ran over by Beijing suggesting the executive duties of the underdevelopment upon a part this week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3728,2022-10-17 04:11:24
15443," Yeah, the timing. I mean, there was nothing necessarily new, but there does seem to be an urgency in Xi Jinping's voice. Shui Li ran over Bloomberg economics. She said, well, she's a colonist. She said he appeared angry when talking not specifically about the US, but about bullying tactics on Taiwan. And the Taiwan issue needs to be resolved by the Chinese. This is what he had to say. Resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese. A matter that must be resolved by the Chinese. We will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but we will never be able to re-nounce the use of the Chinese. And we will serve the option of taking all measures necessary. And he essentially said complete reunification must be realized and can be realized. As you said, Manus, the big question is when and how? Yeah, and then of course, there's no small response mechanism mechanism is it Stephen from the United States of America, verbal or visitors to these Stephen? Thank you very much. Chief North Asia correspondent Stephen Angle on Xi's speeches on Sunday. It's the UK's fourth chancellor, I think, Shaka. In his many months, he spoke into the media following his appointment on Friday in the wake of the quasi-quartine sacking. Here's what Jeremy Hunt told the BBC. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can because our long term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that. Well, this comes to speculation swirls about whether Liz Truss can cling to power. Bloomberg's Leigh Ann Garrons joined us from London. I mean, there's nowhere to hide that press conference on Friday, Leigh Ann. Let's just start there because this was a prime minister who didn't know where to look. Didn't know who was in front of her in the room. Well, that's certainly how it looked and sounded. They take from London. Good day. Manus, good day to you. Yes, extremely rattled prime minister on Friday. I think that speech lasted exactly eight minutes and 21 seconds. She wasn't hanging around. Was she to take questions from the media? She quickly came in and delivered that there was a new chancellor. That is, of course, Jeremy Hunt. And as you mentioned there, the fourth chancellor in just a full month. But now what is the head for the Symbattled Prime Minister, Liz Truss, who's been in office for just 41 days. And I think the real take is going to be how the markets react to this massive reversal that happened on Friday. And this new outline that is to come when it comes to fiscal policy in the country, Manus. Yes, in terms of the belief in her as a premier, Leigh Ann, I mean, where are we? There's some pretty awful stuff out there, but it sounds as if it's only a matter of time that she endures as prime minister. What's the latest that you're reading that you're getting from the polls and that back messaging from those back benches? So the latest polling shows that the Labour government is now 27 points ahead of the Conservative government as things are looking as we also stand today. And there was rife speculation in all of the newspapers over the weekend that a plot to house to list Truss, God, Theresa May, I still call her that. Sometimes I get myself a little bit confused. Forgive me. I think that we've had, you know, we're okay. We barely know Leigh Ann. We barely know who the chancellor is. I think the fact of the day, Greg sent it to me this morning, the producer of the show. Have you got the fact of the day? No, I don't have the fact of the day. The day on the conference. The fact of the day. Oh, this is one of those moments when I get to help the reporter. This is what is it? 22 years. 22 years. I think we had a number of chances. And in the space of four months, we've had four. And this is the Muhammad Aliere in pieces. And it's about credibility, Leigh Ann, isn't it? Quickly. His piece was absolutely excellent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3729,2022-10-17 04:15:13
15444," Isn't it about credibility, Leanne? Isn't it quickly? His piece was absolutely excellent over the weekend. I did read that. And it did make me really think that this is where we are now going to see the battle line drawn. Is Jeremy Hunt going to be able to come in? I know that he said, and that's not earlier, that we heard, that he was planning to stick to many of the tax cuts. But my feeling and the feeling from reading in between his lines is that he is actually going to have to rise, raise taxes in the country, and he is also going to have to really cut public spending in order to fulfill this deficit that we're seeing after this money budget was announced. OK, and that's just toxic at the polls. Between 1997 and 2019, 22 years, you'd four chancellors and four months you've had four. So you learn something every day when you tune in. Very brave, Leanne. Yes, thank you so much for that. We have one now. Leanne, be well. We'll see you through the morning. Younger and London HQ. Let's get to the first word. First word, headlines from around the world. Set the agenda. Julie, it's Ali's with me in Singapore, Jules. Manus, the European Union's executive arm is planning a mechanism to curb price volatility in the block's biggest gas marketplace. It wants to prevent extreme price spikes in derivative trading to rein in the region's energy crisis. The temporary mechanism would impose a dynamic price limit for transactions on the Dutch title transfer facility. The benchmark for all gas traded on the continent. A delayed statement from G-25 Anastas and Central Bankers has laid bare divisions on issues including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions, but clashes between major nations meant that this time, it took three days. As senior White House officials says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. The National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Rheard after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production. And South Korean boy band BTS has performed together for what could be the last time in years. Saturday's concert in Busan was to promote South Korea's second bigger city as a candidate to host the 2030 World Expo. In June, the band said it would go on an indefinite hiatus as its members focus on solo projects. The oldest singer in the group also faces a deadline this year to begin compulsory military service.

15445," Crypto learners, you know, we have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such the wild west. So it's so uncertain. But there's, it has the potential to completely upend everything. This is really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N., we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European flows with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Steele in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis, weekdays. Whether the committee would want to pull some proposed or thought of policy rate increases from 2023 into the December meeting, I think that's a judgement it's pretty mature to make. The St. Louis Fed President, James Bullard, on the Fed's next moves and the latest inflation expectation served by the University of Michigan, top the estimates, further cementing at least 75 bips from the Fed in November. Well, investors are cautious at the start of the week. Markets away the outcome of the UK's tax plan, possible intervention from the Bank of Japan and corporate earnings. Letter, the street from Goldman's Bank of America, Tesla and Netflix, where is my risk as we stomp out the week? Brett McGonagall can do that for us. He is the capital link CEO. Good to see you. There's no relent. He's an ardent front loader, as they would say, in my part of the world. I'm talking about Bullard. It's premature to talk about pulling forward 2023 rates, hikes into 2022. But certainly what it does do, it changes the narrative, doesn't it? It galvanizes the narrative for two more clips of 75 basis points. Are you in that camp in the next two meetings? Do I think it's going to happen most likely? Do I agree with it? Absolutely. And the consequences if they do? The consequences if they do is that they've gotten so far ahead of themselves already, that the economy underneath it can't, by any means, sustain it. And they're going to be looking to go the other way at the end of first quarter. I think we're in this position where how long can the Fed and the PBOC be at polar opposites? My feeling is the PBOC is acting in a way that suggests they understand the underlying economy, whereas the Fed is not. Do you think the Fed has, I mean, the debate is this, Jamie Diamond in his news conference, never mind what he said on another TV station, because that's history. He's talking about another recession, quite a serious tone, six to nine months. Then in the news conference, Danny sent me through this morning, there's no signs of breaking in credit. Things are not materially worse off than there were three months ago. So you're saying one thing on one station for a headline. And here we are, the reality in his news conference on his own bank. They haven't broken anything yet in the US economy? Yes or no? No, they have broken. The Fed has broken it, because the Fed is so far ahead of itself that they can't reel it back, and it's destruction to the consumer in the US right now. Please talk me through this, because the current conditions in the University of Michigan are grand, okay? By the way, mortgages are 7% just in case anybody hadn't noticed. So what are you saying that says the consumer is breaking, broken, crumbling? Well, so let's just, let's start at the point that this is a supply side issue. Right. So we don't have this huge amount of demand that's pushing prices higher, right? So this is the old supply side, Keynesian battle that's been going on forever. So where we sit is the consumer is basically sitting on their hands right now. The housing market is cooling, right? The housing market has been the theme around the world. It's the Chinese security deal right now. It's going to become the US as well. There's speculative capital built up that will be washed out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3731,2022-10-17 04:24:07
15446," Market has been the theme around the world. It's the Chinese Achilles heel right now. It's going to become the US as well. There's speculative capital built up that will be washed out. So where is most of the household equity is in your home? The consumer. The wealth of your home. Yeah. So when that gets destroyed like it has and rates have gone up, you know, month on month, they're going up by, you know, huge amounts. Where is the stability in the market? It doesn't sit there right now. So the question becomes how long can the Fed keep pushing a textbook solution to a situation where they actually need to get their hands in there and see what's going on? You can't read this from a textbook, but that seems to be the response. Okay. Well, they were pilloried when inflation got away from them and they did nothing. They'd been pilloried now if you're doing too much. So, you know, the market can't have it everywhere. Let's talk about credit. We're in a critical zone according to Bank of America. IG Assurance is back at the levels of 2008. There's a significant risk of dysfunction. Now, this is the standard rates that I've got for you on the screen, which is IG and high yield. We think the Fed can temporarily lose the high yield market, but not the IG. Can they afford to lose the high yield market? And do you see any cracks in high yield? We haven't seen huge cracks in high yield in the US right now. The investment, investment grade market, as we know, is a little bit more stable. Yep. I think that they can hold on. Look, I think they can back all of this out. That's the beauty of the idea that they've been talking. They've been talking. It's all hawkish. Now, what happens is if they say do 75 in November, I think you get 50 in December. I don't think it's a 75. And then I think it's a pause. Now, do they change the whole narrative that they're going to pivot? They won't say that. They can't say that. However, I think once you start to see the underlying economy, you're going to get two things. Destruction and underlying economy, and you're also going to see an abatement of inflation. And at that point, how do you sustain that? The rates you can't. I don't think it works. OK, I want to pivot very quickly. It's day one without the bank of England in technical backstop to the yield market. But let's listen to Andrew Bailey and what he had to say the weekend. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And as things stand to day, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps fought in August. Go on, Bailey. We might get a lumpier hike. A lumpier hike than we had in August. Is that enough to save starting? Briefly. I think in the short term, yes. But we need to see something out of Louis Trust and C. Will she be in the seat? I think by the end of the week? Well, I mean, I don't know how you were better judge on how it works than I do. But I think with Bailey, he's saying he's got control right now. Yeah. He's telling the market where it is. He's got a new chancellor. He's got 40 days of a PM. I just don't know where it breaks. Unfortunately, I think the path of least resistance is lower right now for the pound. But I do think that he can put it back on the tracks here. Give me a level on the dawn, so I've Bretton, then you can go. I think it goes 105 near term, then I think it stabilizes higher. OK. A cheeky level at 105. Bret, when you're back in time, we'll see whether it actually traded down to there, whether stabilization prevailed, which I hope it does. Bret McGonagall, my guest this morning on Global Risk, the CEO of Capital Link, right here on Daybreak Middle East. You wake up, show for a Monday morning.北 stains blanc black. Why is everybody want to be a consultant? And what are all these consultants doing? Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultants seem to imply that we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3732,2022-10-17 04:28:46
15447," to all these consultants doing. Well David, I think that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice. And when you look at what Accenture does, we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant. We're really about relevance and results. And that's what is driving our business. What about a consulting project? In my example, I'm the CEO, I have a problem, I call you up, I say solve my problem or give me a solution. We don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode. And so when you think about how long does it solve things, a lot of it starts with the company being willing to set aggressive goals. And so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster.

Monday morning, daybreak Middle East has your risk. Well, equity markets managed to claw a-n-th of a percent back from the cap sizing that took place on Friday. The Nasdaq is just off the lowest level since 2020, the wealth effect, $15 trillion globally has been wiped off global equity markets. That is almost as much as 2008. I've just had Brett McGonagall from CapitalLink talking about the feds functioning in this market. Let me roll it over, show to you in the bond markets. Brett's point as he walked off set was that the school yard bully is in effect the feds in terms of the momentum it's delivering to the dollar. And in terms of what it's doing to rates, it's pushing too hard, it's front loaded too aggressively. I mean, they can't win. They were left behind last year in terms of not responsive enough. You'll stop this morning to your paper trades at 4.46. You are here in Bullard, possibly open to a larger hike in December. Don't forget he's a fan of front loading. Roll it over, have a look at the oil. I mean, it's really ramping up in terms of the rhetoric in the oil market. The White House says there was no market basis for the production cut. They told the society's that. Other OPEC nations of Bloomberg scoop felt course to support the societies. And the Americans are saying the Saudi foreign ministry can try and spin it or deflect anyway they want. The market is tight, rough, 7.10 to 1%.

We're talking there about some of these bearish calls for 150 which is very much insight from Goldman and City saying last week 160 to the dollar two. We've certainly had more verbal intervention coming through with warnings of bold action repeated again at the G20 but so far we just remain on intervention watch as to whether or not there has been some market moves. I also want to point to what's happening in iron ore because there was disappointment about she's policy speech really not alluding to the fact that they are going to ditch COVID zero so that has sent iron ore futures here in Singapore down by more than 2% you've got iron ore sliding towards lowest since 2021 because no prospect of these changes to policies really mean of course ravaged to still demand as well. When it comes to the equity market we are back in the red on the back of that weakness on Wall Street and not really lifted by the upside you're seeing in US equity futures Australia Taiwan among the lagans there and despite that fairly flat year and you've still got the Nikkei dropping it's holding just under 27,000 points there man. Yeah, there's a lot of moving parts. Talk to me about city group they remain bearish on the yuan after she's policy speech it was along to our speech zero COVID's not going anywhere and there wasn't really a standard alpha for markets was there. No absolutely not and so this is going to be once again a strong dollar story which is why city is remaining a little bit more bearish here again against the yuan so they're saying you could see seven spots three to the dollar in a strong dollar environment when we're kind of looking at these levels of 7.2 for the offshore. The bottom line in thinking they say remain long dollar versus the offshore yuan with options and they underweight the overall CNY the onshore yuan in a basket of EM currencies. We're also of course looking at the PBOC movement in terms of that MLF function they kept that rate at 2.75% but they did roll over 500 billion yuan in that facility so that was mainly expected by the market but today we did have another stronger than expected fix the strongest on record OCBC saying this of course moves there reflects rather the need to continue to support the economy and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3734,2022-10-17 04:36:50
15449," Today we did have another stronger than expected fix. The strongest on record, OCBC saying this of course moves. There are a flex rather than need to continue to support the economy and overall credit. Manus. Jules, thank you very much. Leave it to you to find the better green there, monster green and the dollar. I love what Brett McGonagall just said there and I said the bully in the school yard, it is the fed on the value of that dollar for Asian economies. He said that in the break, but apparently I could quote him. Well, I have quoted him. There you go. Jules, thank you very much. Now the Bank of America strategies say that the key credit stress gauge is in the critical zone and this comes as you got the red hot US inflation, prints, spurring expectations of more jumbo rate hikes from the fed. Let's bring in Doug Bittcon and see whether he thinks he has credit strategies at Rosmala investment. So Bank of America say we are in the critical zone of the spreads and that the fed could lose the high yield market but they have to be very careful not to lose as opposed to hold of the investment grade market. Are we at some kind of critical point in credit markets overall? Let's just start with the backdrop. Yes, Manus, I think in the high yield space we have seen credit spreads blowing out and that is creating some issues within that market. At this point in time we haven't seen anything breaking and I think the fed is going to continue to raise rates until they do start seeing bigger cracks within this space because of they behind the curve in terms of inflation. Do we, are we immune? What I've looked at is our yield market. I mean this is the perennial question is I've looked at our high yield, sorry our investment grade spreads over treasures relative to US spreads over treasures and you said well maybe I need to think about it a slightly different way but there is this monster revaluation on yield that we've seen we put it in the GTV library. Talk me through, I mean with monster yield comes some kind of a moment where global investor step in here and maybe look at a rate over treasure yield to the end of 5.8% for GCC treasuries relative to US treasuries. Yes, I think there is definitely, there is an argument to look at where yield have gone and if we look at some of the hard grade paper out of the region, every dovey government and you're talking your 30 year paper, you're getting around about 5.5% and we haven't seen those kind of yields for an extended period of time. Also if we look at the spreads we've actually seen and this has really been, while we've been reluctant to move into the longer duration, is we haven't seen the spread moving wider in the region because of the elevated oil price. But if you look at the last couple of weeks we've actually seen on avey dovey government, we've actually seen how government spreads have actually moved out by around about 40 basis points. So you're now getting a spread from 160 up to 200, you're seeing KSA, it's actually moved up around about 50 basis points in that part of the curve. So you actually are starting to see credit spreads widening and this is resulted in losses and this segment of the curve of around about 30% year to date. Then the argument is of course that we're pivoting from duration into the shorter end of the curve and that's sort of a large part of the moves have been. You mentioned oil and I want to get to that because there is a brewing risk here. Let's listen to what the Jake Sullivan had to say to CNN over the weekend. The president isn't going to act precipitously, he's going to act methodically, strategically and he's going to take his time to consult with members of both parties and also to have an opportunity for Congress to return so that he can sit with them in person and work through the office. Is halting arms, is options include, as I was just saying, those options include changes to our approach to security assistance to Saudi Arabia. It's getting very, very bumpy, isn't it, between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. If you've had Sahil Al-Mazroui, the oil minister for the U.E. coming out on Twitter this morning, making the point that there was no coercion, it was a unified decision. You're listening to Jake Sullivan and I talking about all options on the table. How february is this relationship? Are you surprised that we're talking about no packet, maybe?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3735,2022-10-17 04:41:35
15450," You're listening to Jake Sullivan and I talking about all options on the table. How febrily is this relationship? Are you surprised that we're talking about no-packing maybe arms, a change in the arms sales? This is what Masri had to say. I'd like to clarify the theopek plus decision was unanimous. It was approved with a pure technical decision. There's no political intentions whatsoever. I can't really. That can't really be the truth. Well, actually what is the most surprising is this all seems to be played out in the media. Normally these discussions would be taking place behind closed doors. And the US appears to be pinning the blame on these oil cuts on Saudi Arabia. They're saying that they leaned on other members of opek to actually support these production cuts. And they are opening the blame on Saudi Arabia. Now this potentially could have an impact on credit spreads in Fosadi Arabia. This escalates. Is that what you're worried about? Credit spreads in Saudi Arabia. Really it could go straight to that grind zero or op-marker risk? I don't think so. The first point they're looking at is arms sales. On the arms sales side they've already curtailed offensive arms weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. But one has to remember that between 2017 and 2021, nearly 25% of US arms sales went to Saudi Arabia. So this is really, it's an important economic partner and also strategically. It's also Saudi Arabia is an important partner. But it's not only Saudi Arabia. But also UAE, now get brought into this feud between the US and Saudi Arabia. And then it's also, is this political? Will it blow over? The point that Israel, Highness Prince of Dulles has been someone made with me and through the interview, which was it was about economics, it was about a strong dollar. It was about the potential for a huge economic dislocation. And this banging of the drum by the central banks to keep raising rates at any cost to do with inflation. So I think one does have to go back and listen to the whole interview to understand his reluctance to talk politics. But also his justification for what they actually did. A Treasury's decided on a lot of US Treasuries. Yes, a lot of US Treasuries, not as many as Japan and China obviously, but they do take some of the Petrodollar inflows and they'll invest in US Treasuries. So they are one of the bigger holders of US Treasuries. What do you bet we hear a little bit more on that? Doug, thank you very much for the concerns about the escalating rhetoric between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America on the oil market and credit spreads. Doug Bitcoin had credit strategies at Rosemarla Investment Bank. Thank you. The IMF's first deputy managing director says that the weakening yen could pose the risks for the Asian financial system if companies or banks have not properly hedged their borrowing. Gita Gopinath told Bloomberg's Tom Keane that many nations are in for a rocky ride as they adjust to the dollar strength. So when you have sizable movements in the dollar, it has very sizable implications for the global economy because it's so dominant in trade and finance. But the important thing to keep in mind is that there are fundamentals that are driving these large movements. They seem very quick, they seem very steep. The differences in the path of monetary policy tightening is one factor. The differences in high-end is the prices are affecting countries is another factor. So I think this is going to be a bit of a rocky ride for countries, but they will have to adjust to it. So they have to use their own monetary policy tools to be able to keep inflation. We're going to speak to Shabber Majid here about emerging markets. Let me stay with the major countries with you, Dr. Gopinath. Let's look at the Yen experiment. All of this meeting in the world, John Farrow is transfixed by Yen 147. What is the council of you and your chief economist to the Japanese to extricate themselves from their unique yield-courved control experiment? They were a pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3736,2022-10-17 04:45:39
15451," and your chief economist to the Japanese to extricate themselves from their unique yield-courved control experiment. There were fundamental reasons for that particular divergence of we seeing in the currency. Japan has decided to stay the course in terms of keeping interest rates low, while the Fed has decided to stay the course in terms of raising interest rates very decisively to bring down inflation. And that of course is one of the primary drivers of the different, of the fact that the yen has lost value relative to the dollar. Now of course over time, monetary policy will have to figure out what the best course is depending upon inflation development in Japan. But as of now, I believe, given the diverging trends, you know, currency movements will look like they do now. With all of your expertise, if Japan capitulates to a more normal monetary policy, and yen goes strong, 148, 150, just as a pick a number out of thin air, 129, what will that do to the Pacific Rim financial system? We have to look into that and see how, what that happens in a disruptive manner, it happens in an orderly manner, right? We always have exchange rate movements all the time. When you have big movements in exchange rates, the problems that come up is when you have firms or banks that have borrowed multiple currencies and have been sufficiently hedge themselves. So those get affected. But if you hedge yourself, I mean, these are movements that you should be using. Now I'm our first deputy manager and director, Gita Gopin-Arthag with Tom King in Washington. Plenty more ahead on Dave Egg Middle East. This is Bl��ngag. Gary Gopin-Arthag. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. And that's a question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Mercedes Benzio says the energy crisis may be a challenge in Europe for the next two to three years, but this could be a catalyst to accelerate the transition to renewables. Mercedes won't have a stand at the Paris car show, but has unveiled a new electric SUV, the CEO, spoke to Bloomberg's Caroline Kona. The last few years has been a challenging business environment with COVID, with supply restrictions. And of course, also the war in Ukraine derives energy prices. If you couple that with interest rates, you know, the economy might cool down, but we've always had these cycles, and we have gone through the cycles. If you have a resilient brand like Mercedes Benz with a very loyal customer base, I think we're going to be prepared for whatever may come. Your third quarter sales were quite strong. Do you expect some kind of moderation in the fourth quarter? We grew by 21% in the third quarter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3737,2022-10-17 04:49:53
15452," Your third quarter sales were quite strong. Do you expect some kind of moderation in the fourth quarter? We grew by 21 percent in the third quarters. We're very happy about that. Very robust. And we're also looking at finishing this year off in a robust fashion. Do the Chinese car makers, especially those making EVs, pose a threat to you? China is the biggest car market in the world. So naturally you will have international brands in China. Like us, it's our biggest and most successful market in the last 10 years. But isn't it naturally in competition that maybe some of those brands are going to try to seek their luck in the European market as well? I think that's all fine. Another challenge, of course, of the kind industry has been the supply chain challenge. What carpods are you missing at the moment? Primarily for the last couple of years or even more. We have been looking at shortages of semiconductors, different kinds of semiconductors. And the chip makers and also the wafer fabs are increasing their production capacities. But that takes time. There's a lead time to build up that. So I think this supply chain constraint will certainly be with us throughout this year and also into next year. And then hopefully as we go through next year step by step, we will see a better situation. With the energy crisis, some also worry that it may have an impact on steel makers. Are you worried you might be missing steel at some point? I think we have to divide this into maybe two phases. Yes, Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany that's been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short to midterm challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer mid to long term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. In fact, we have made two very big decisions only in the last couple of months. We're going to build a sizable wind park on one of our premises in north of Germany. And also signed up just recently with an energy company here in Europe, a massive wind park in the Baltic Sea. So those two projects alone in the mid to long term will cover 40% of our electricity needs. So you can see now that companies are making decisions to create resilience in the mid to long term. The Mercedes CEO, the Ola Kaleneas speaking to Bloomberg. Pennymore, I had on this Monday morning edition of Daybreak Middle East. This is Bloomberg.

15453," MUSIC Prime Minister, clearly a difficult day. Can you explain to the public why you think you should remain as prime minister given you jumped a key tax cut that led you to be elected and got rid of your chancellor? You, though, wanted to cut 45 p-rate. You still had a platform to win the leadership of the Conservative Party on a platform to cut corporation tax. You and the chancellor, the ex-chancellor, designed this budget together in lockstep were told. It, times and secrets, the two of you, he has to go because of the fallout from it. How come you get to stay? Excuse the Bundesprime Minister, but given everything that has happened, what credibility do you have to continue governing? The former Tory chancellor, Fultham and his just said that you have totally trashed the Tory parties, election-winning reputation for economic competence. Will you apologise to your party? I'm absolutely determined to see through what I have promised. Well, my priority is making sure we deliver the economic stability that our country needs. What I've done today is made sure that we have economic stability in this country. Well, I am determined to deliver on what I set out. Liz Truss, coming under intense questioning there from the journalist during her own press conference in Dining Street on Friday, and that was after she sat the chancellor. Truss was reportedly asked if she could last as Prime Minister, Blumberg's Lizzie Burden, joins us now from Dining Street, Lizzie, a Prime Minister who appeared to the world very much out of her depth and didn't seem to know who was in the room or where to look. It didn't go so well. It's Trussonomic's dead. If it isn't dead yet, Manus, it seems like it soon will be. You heard that press conference there. It was scant on detail, no sign of an apology. And even though the U-turn on corporation tax is politically embarrassing, it doesn't do much to balance the books. Our economists say that she's got £24 billion worth of savings to find. And so we heard from the new chancellor over the weekend Jeremy Hunt, and he suggested that there are going to be more U-turns in the pipeline. Take a listen to this. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can, because our long-term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that. So Liz Truss is going to host the cabinet here at number 10, Downing Street tonight to gauge what those U-turns will be. But as a result of all this, Jeremy Hunt now seems to be the most powerful figure in the government, which begs the question, what is the point of having Liz Truss at the top at all? Three Tory MPs have already publicly called for her to quit. Behind the scenes MPs are weighing up whether to roll the dice on a new leader now, which would surely bring about a snap general election. Or should they cling on until 2024 and face what seems from the polls to be near total wipeout? But this is the price Liz Truss has paid for short-term market stability. We've seen the pound-lift in Asia trading reflecting really the seemingly sealed fate of Truss and Trussonomics. MPs are going to have a close eye on guilt today now that the BOE's stabilizers are off. Yeah, I mean, I think Mahamad El-Aryans op-ed really makes it very, very clear. They're going to have to do an awful lot more than a few U-turns on tax. There's still a structural deficit. There's a credibility void, never-minded deficit. And now, of course, we have a bank of ink, which is not technically present today for the first time in the guilt market. Will we get to the closer business today without the bank of England bailing out the guilt market? Well, there are hopes that Andrew Bailey is going to step in and do some more, have his own, whatever it takes, moment, take some advice from Mario Draghi. And that could come in the form of a delayed quantitative tightening. It could be the introduction of a new facility. Partly, really, Manus, it depends on how much the pension funds...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3739,2022-10-17 04:58:36

Coming down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak here up I'm Danny Berger in London. Managed crannies in Dubai with the stories that set your agenda. Down in street hot seat the UK's Liz Truss battles to rescue her premiership. The pine gains on expectations of more U-turns from the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can because our long term health depends on being a low tax economy and I very strongly believe that.

The latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills. Danny Good morning. It was captivating watching the spectacle of the Dynastreek press conference on Friday night. The guilt market reacted with some virulence. I like what Lord Jim O'Neil have to say. She's wrapped herself into these markets even more than she was before the press conference. Good morning, Danny. Good morning, Managed. Pound moving higher at least confidence that there will be a full U-turn. Will we get details of the full U-turn today, Managed? We're now looking at a headline crossing the UK Chancellor will make a statement today on the new fiscal plan that Jeremy Hunt. Of course, you spent the weekend talking about this idea as we heard from that bit of sound that those tax raises need to stay in check for now, Managed. This is still a confidence void. There's still a credibility void. The only void that they can fill is that fiscal unfunded gap. And the question is how much more brutal will he be with U-turns and how much longer will she be in power? That is what the market is punting on. So a couple things to keep your eye on for today. That statement coming from the Chancellor and the open of the UK bond market, which of course will happen at 8 a.m. UK time. In the meantime, Managed, let me show you what this futures market is doing. I went ahead and put UK futures on here. They are moving lower, not as low as the rest of Europe, but they did underperform pretty significantly yesterday. The recovery is writing that corporate tax changes, hiking taxes, they are a big deal for equity investors. It does mean that capex and hiring will be deferred. Meanwhile, S&P 500 futures, those moving up half a percent, gomen out with a note that yes, the entirety of this US stock market, it is expensive. But there are some deals and individual names that have sold off with everything. And finally, Asian equities, those moving lower after sell off on Wall Street Friday down more than 1 percent, Managed. Yeah, the $15 trillion has been wiped off the global equity value and wealth destruction is brutal. Let me show you across the market. You've got the oil market rallying a little bit up 3.4%, just 1% despite G not moving on zero COVID. And the war of words between the White House and the House of Sard is ramping higher in terms of coercion accusations from the White House towards other OPEC nations.

Lizzie. Thank you so much bloomberg's Lizzie bird in there With the latest on the UK Let's turn to China now though President Xi Jinping delivered a defiant message to the world in a speech at the communist party congress That message that China is ready to stand its ground. She also signaled no change in direction for two main risk factors dragging the economy down risk strict COVID rules and housing market policies for more on this we're joined by Rebecca Chung Wilkins our Asia government reporter Rebecca What was this vision that she painted of China's global role in this world? Well, Xi Jinping took this quite strident defiant tone to paint a picture of China that is more powerful and more influential in the world Essentially saying that the national rejuvenation of China was inevitable Even with the sort of dangerous storms and the hostile environment that he is facing And one of the parts that seemed to resonate Most strongly both with Xi Jinping and the party itself was this message around Taiwan in particular The language itself wasn't particularly unusual that sort of pushing back against foreign interference Saying that they will not renounce the possible use of force But it was the tone that I think was quite remarkable Xi Jinping's voice appeared to crack with anger at one point And it was the point in the speech that by far had the longest or what",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3743,2022-10-17 05:14:05
15456," It was the tone that I think was quite remarkable. Seed Imping's voice appeared to crack with anger at one point. And it was the point in the speech that by far had the longest, or one of the longest applause from all of those party delegates. And it's a really important reminder that this political event is mainly about selling this vision of China and China's future to his party and to a domestic audience. Rebecca, good to see you. What were the messages on the economic priorities? And the market doesn't seem to have taken any great vigor away from his comments around zero COVID, or indeed the property market? Well, quite frankly, I think markets probably priced in quite a lot of pessimism going into this. There wasn't a lot of hope for a U-turn on either COVID-0 or property. And indeed, we didn't see any sort of lifting of either of those two. I mean, there was an interesting point on the sort of future direction potentially for economic growth. Seed Imping focused on science and education in a way that he hasn't done in his 2017 speech and analyst interpreting that this is Seed Imping's real bet on restoring economic growth and meeting those foreign policy targets that competition with the US by focusing on innovation here to try and help revive the economy. So that was perhaps one sort of bright spot there that we saw. There was this little nod, though, to just how challenging the economic period is going to be for Chinese people. He encouraged and promoted this idea of the spirit of frugality across society. Just a brief sort of hint about the kind of period of austerity that we are going into now. Seed Imping, of course, for the first time in a decade, about to oversee a China that is suffering an economic downturn. OK, Rebecca. Let's see what the week brings in terms of market responses we build up. Rebecca Chung Wilkins, our Asia government reporter, will invest in Asia, appeared disappointed, one could say, by the Chinese president's speech, traders remain on Yan Watch, Yan intervention watch, Juliet Sally is with us now. Well, we thought 145 was the break point to yield curve control and significant intervention. What do we have so far today and what do we expect, Jules? Yes, the end still at that 32 year low amount. So certainly a lot of intervention watch. Let's start with the broader picture, though, because we did have the factors, Rebecca alluded to, that there wasn't a turnaround from COVID-19 policy or strong policy support for the property sector. So you've still got the CSI 300 trading at these lowest levels since the beginning of the pandemic. And certainly a lot of weakness coming through in the likes of iron or futures here in Singapore as well, all leading to a negative day for Asian stocks. And those tech players coming under pressure as well, after we saw that broad US tech sell off too. We did have the PBOC once again trying to de-stem the decline in its currency with a stronger fix. They also rolled over the MLF with that rate at 2.75%. And you've got a slightly stronger offshore you want there, but city saying, look, watch it get to seven spots three due to the fact that we didn't see any turnaround from she in terms of COVID-19 zero. And that is going to continue to prop up the dollar two. Let's flip the board and have a look at the Yan, of course, we've had once again more verbal. Intervention from the likes of the top official Canada G20 and also the finance minister Suzuki as well. But so far, no inclination that we have actually seen some money into really try and stem this decline, which is continuing to see the Yen touch that 32 year low. 150 very much in sight, Goldman saying that will happen quite soon. City will talking last week say 160 to the dollar. And they each are saying, look, perhaps Japan will be cautious about intervening without US support. You've certainly seen a pickup in yields to the 30 year touching one and a half percent Danny for the first time since 2015. All right, jewels. Thank you very much.

Yeah, well coming up we're going to talk about Mr Bullard leaving the door open to the possibility that the Fed may raise interest rates by 75 faces points at each of the next two meetings we focus on further Fed action that's next on Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys and that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating a Love. Yeah. Now I would have a much more experience about those who say that love you and tend to stray you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at the stage. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional because when you subscribe to Bloomberg you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Whether the committee would want to pull some proposed or thought of policy rate increases from 2023 into the December meeting. I think that's a judgment that's pretty mature to make. St. Louis Fed President James Bollard there on the possibility of a larger heart hike in December. Manus, we have of course had that data out from Friday. You Mitch continuing to show gains in inflation expectations. Well, let's take some of those risks to our guests. It is Sinha, Global Head of Private Capital Advisory at Raymond James. Great to have you with us this morning. A lot to chew over between the UK at a breaking point again. And the Fed, we know that this man Bollard is a front loader. The question is, Malaske said the Fed are bullying neither. Overdoing it, they're pushing too hard and the narrative around 75 basis points. So both of the next meetings is just too much. It'll break something. Do you think they'll do 75 bips in both? And what's the risk of something breaking? I think the likelihood of them doing 75 basis points and more is definitely higher for the U-Mish survey results last week. Reason being is that they're late to the party in inflation control. We all know that. And the world is in the world economy is paying the price, especially the US real world impact is getting quite real now with these increases. They're afraid of doing too little rather than too much. And yes, the risk of course is that they break growth. And much more important than concerning to me is that they're risking financial stability in parts of the market, which is a risk that's yet to be priced in. If that's so, it's an...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3745,2022-10-17 05:22:26
15458," Is there risk that's yet to be priced in? If that's so, Seneda, how do we buy risk assets? How do you form a thesis that says, jump in here with everything selling off and buy risk? Well, the only place is to buy risk is where you get some risk adjustment, right? So think about what instruments give you that kind of risk adjustment. Or what parts of the markets, including the equity markets or the bond markets, look healthier today versus six months ago or even three months ago. So what are we talking about here? I think companies that are more exposed to US domestic consumer or domestic demand are going to be better off than global businesses. Services businesses, better off than goods businesses. Industries that are better exposed to a lower growth environment are not that impacted by lower growth, probably better off insurance services, health care services, and so on. You've got to pick your spots. Is it time to go long holistically? No, very difficult to do that today. So, Nia, can I just challenge that a little bit? It's all very well saying, you know, step in to some of those parts of the UK. But the wealth effect, I just want to deal with this. I mean, we've got a great article. The wealth effect, 4% of the US wealth has been wiped out. 144 trillion, the second biggest wealth wipe out since 2008. How much more wary does that make your value relative to growth, even though growth has got been trashed? Very wary. So you've got to be very careful as to where you want to pick your spots because yield is not a bad place to be in cash today, right? You've got a lot of FDs yielding 4.5% and going up. So you've got to think about where is the risk premium worth investing today and you've got to be micro. You can't be macro today because of the wealth effect that you're talking about that on a real basis. A lot of these assets are not yielding enough for you to take that kind of risk premium on. So it's time to be a macro. Perhaps it was just too easy to invest in the past where you bought anything and it would go up. This other risk though, or the other risk, there are a lot. You have US midterm elections coming up. You have OPEC plus determined to push up the price of gas. The war in Ukraine continues to get more intense. You have China as well. What do you fear the most? You know, what I fear the most today is what is started to develop in the UK over the last couple of weeks, which is the financial stability risk in parts of markets. Those air pockets that can be created by this higher rate for sheep, the markets are too used to low rates high liquidity. As this pivot, spokesman can be caught out and parts of the non-bank sector can be caught out. That risk is paramount because that can be an exogenous shock to the market that can really destabilize things very quickly. Well, let's just talk about deteriorating liquidity. We have Janet Yellen warning about liquidity in the bond markets. And I like what Bank of America's note talked about. They talked about the risk of significant dysfunction and the underpriced risks are credit freezes, liquidity breaks and potential decline in foreign demand. We're showing them the GTV library and the ratcheting higher in terms of some of the spreads, which determine a view on liquidity. Are you seeing a material evaporation of liquidity and is it a concern which we are cognizant of, which we are understanding enough of at the moment? I think it's certainly the understanding is yet to occur in terms of which markets house specifically. We're still in the early innings of that. What is clear is that as these financial instability issues arise in different markets, it makes central bank policy incredibly difficult and uncertain to implement. Right? So you saw that with the Bank of England doing quantitative easing in the long end of the curve while signaling tightening in an aggressive way to control inflation. Those two things start to run into each other very quickly and that's danger. Well, I also wonder because you mentioned these issues are popping up in non-banking sectors. These are non-banking financial institutions, pensions. Do central banks or central banks equip to handle that considering they transmit monetary policy through the banking sector? Well, they're there as crisis management tools, right? Just as you saw Andrew Bailey come in and step in and say, listen, I'll buy these bonds. I'll make sure the market functions for a short period of time two weeks in his case. They can do that. They're the funder of last resort to try to make markets healthy and function. They cannot afford for the bond market to break. That is not a possibility because of the incredible side effects that ten million investorial banks,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3746,2022-10-17 05:29:53
15459," of last resort to try to make markets healthy and function. They cannot afford for the bond market to break. That is not a possibility because of the incredible side effects that that had spillover effects in the real economy. However, in the short term, all these central banks are looking at their other potential agencies to try to figure out where the risk lies and how can you do an orderly, deleveraging of balance sheets to ensure that this doesn't spill over again. Okay. So, Nina, thank you very much. Helping us navigate the wildness that has been these markets. Suñena, Sinha, there, global head of private capital advisory at Raymond Jains. Now, coming up, the new plan the EU is considering to tackle the growing energy crisis. We're going to bring you the details of that next. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to next zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3,000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace, there's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. The multi-trillion dollar industry, there's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany that's been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short to mid-term challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer, mid to long-term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. Can you see these Ben-Cio there, or are Kalenias speaking to Bloomberg about Europe's challenges and what they face now in terms of an energy crisis? And how that may fasten the push into renewables. So Danny, it's interesting to see everybody debates this in an energy crisis, delays the transition, but it's not denied. You know, it's becoming that peak moment as we go to COP, isn't it? Yeah, it is. And at the same time, we still have to contend with what actual regulations will look like, because Man is at the same time absolved of this. The European Commission is planning to put forward a dynamic price cap on the EU's biggest gas exchange. Now, this is all part of a range of measures to tackle the energy crisis, all of this, according to a draft document of the plan seen by Bloomberg. Let's get more into it. Special guest, special star appearance in our London studio, it's European correspondent Maria Tadeo, who joins us. So, Maria, what is this dynamic price cap? Danny, welcome.

15461," appearance in our London studio. It's European correspondent Maria today. Oh, who joins us. So Maria, what is this dynamic price cap? Danny, welcome. Very good to see and a dynamic price cap. You don't know what it is. Who can blame you? Right? This is a lot of the technicalities that the European Commission is working on. But just to take a few steps back, because really, this is a core of the issue. You do very well. The commission has argued. When you look at the TTF, right, this is the benchmark essential for gas prices. It no longer reflects the real price dynamics that are going on in Europe. We've seen that exports and imports of Russian gas essential have gone from 40% to 7%. The European Union is now switching to LNG. They want to create their own index for LNG by the way, starting next year. But on the interim, what they argue is that the volatility and the price swings have to be contained. Now, this is where we get to a dynamic price cap. What it means is that essentially they would allow some moves in this market. But once you go past a threshold, you'd have a limit up. Transaction is closed. It's actually that's the idea behind it. What it does is that it creates a consensus between those that really want to see a full cap and those that say I do not like it, because it could be a disruption for supply. But I would say one thing. This is a draft. A lot of things can change. Tomorrow, the commission will meet again. And I would not be surprised to see that by Thursday, a lot of things change. Maria, we've actually run out of time. We can continue this conversation. Are you going to be with us through the morning? I suppose there's a question, Maria, of whether they all get on board with this price cap. And what it really means. And I think it's perfect to make that point that those gas markets are broken and something a lot of our gas have told us time and time again. Maria, we'll see you a little bit later on. If not in the next couple of hours. She's on the grind. We should make it take advantage of you. Up early, Maria, today in London. Danny, let's just return to the breaking news headlines. We're going to hear from in Hunt. We trust. Did you like that? Yep. In Hunt, we trust. We're going to hear a little bit more. Exactly. Maybe we'll hear a little bit more about what he is going to backtrack on. You turn on in terms of tax. Yeah, and we'll still get those full plans come October 31st. But again, we'll get something. The Treasury says this morning will continue that conversation coming up. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis.

15462," this is Blinberg daybreak here by Menace Crennie and Dubai. Danny Berger, London HQ with the story, setting your agenda. Downing Street, hot seat, the UK's Liz Truss battles to rescue her pre-morship, the pound gains on expectations of more U-turns from New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, he's due to make a statement later this morning on his fiscal plan. Taking a stand, China's Xi Jinping backs COVID-0 at his party Congress, doubling down on policies at the center of tensions with the US. Chinese stock slide. Plus, the EU plans to temporarily overhaul the continent's gas market with a dynamic price cap, its latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills. Man, it's good morning. Happy Monday to you. A statement on its way from Jeremy Hunt, Pound, pushes higher versus the dollar. Absolutely, we understand both the Chancellor and the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey spoke last night ahead of the debt management office. Sorry, the Chancellor met with the governor of the Bank of England and the head of the debt management office to brief them on his plans. So this is about a reunification of FP with MP and that is something the markets will latch onto Danny. Yeah, of course, we'll see exactly how that plays out at 8 a.m. this morning, man, it's when bond markets open, but for now, we're getting some hints from the Treasury market moving higher. We are indeed. There's the point. I mean, over the past two days, it's not back at its highs on Friday, but certainly it's reversing course from its Nadeira to run the 103 just over the 103 level 20 days ago when the quasi-quartine economics and trust dynamics came to bear and trashed both the guilt market, the currency market and the confidence of global investors in global Britain. To the markets, or a little bit higher this morning, yeah, and when the intervene, well, it'd be 152 year-nitch roll over in terms of you were dipping this morning, as Bullard opens the door, perhaps to a larger than expected rate hike in 2022 in December 2022 and the dollar rose down. The bully in the school yard, according to my guest, a capital link. The dollar is the bully we dip by an 8th of 1%, 2 tenths of 1%, Danny. Meanwhile, we are looking at both UK and wider European futures in the red this morning. Man, it's down 3 tenths of 1% Jeffries warning that higher UK corporate taxes does matter for equity investors. It means less spending, less cat-bex, less hiring. And of course, we had a pretty negative session on Wall Street on Friday after those U-Mitch numbers showed inflation expectations say firmly entrenched that we are getting a little bit of consolidation after that sell-off S&P 500 futures up more than half a percent. But the sell-off continues in Asia, man, is down 1% for the MSCI Asia Pacific. Well, we are focused on the UK, obviously, Danny, in terms of any nuance that comes through Liz Truss's position as UK Prime Minister is coming under increased pressure following the series of U-turns in the mini-budget, resulting in the sacking of Chancellor. That left her plans for the economy quite literally in tatters. The new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is due to make a statement to the markets a little bit later on. And we are just seeing here that in the Times there is a headline that in the Times that Truss has signed off to faring the 1P income tax cut until 2024. But the damage is all but done. Lizzy Bowden is outside Dining Street for his now-lizzy. I mean, this is an annihilation of Truss economics. What do we expect from Huntonomics? Well, Manus, markets certainly seem to think that Trussonomics is dead or on its way to being hence the rise in the pound in Asia trading. The Prime Minister's press conference on Friday lacked both detail and an apology for the U-turn on corporation tax and the sacking of quasi-quarting, politically embarrassing, but not doing much to balance the book. So we're expecting when Hunt makes his statement in the comments today to give us a little more detail on how that-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3748,2022-10-17 05:38:35
15463," Politically embarrassing but not doing much to balance the books. So we're expecting when Hunt makes his statement in the Commons today to give us a little more detail on how they're going to balance the books. Economists at Bloomberg Economics reckon trust needs to find 24 billion pounds in revenue razors and savings. But because trustonomics is being dismantled piece by piece, MPs behind the scenes are asking themselves what's the point of having her at the top, has she got weeks or months left? And they're asking themselves, do we want to gamble on a new leader now and face a snap general election? Or do we want to face almost certain wipeout in 2024? A lot's going to hang on what happens in the guilt market today, of course, guilt's tanked on Friday after that underwhelming statement. Let's see what happens today now that the BOE's help is gone. Well, what do we expect from the BOE, Lisi, in terms of continued support, of course, independence front and center for the BOE at this moment? Yeah, that's the message that Andrew Bailey wanted to underscore at the IMF. Over the weekend, he suggested that bigger hikes are going to be needed, including at the November meeting, then was there expected in August as a result of the fiscal plans. Take a listen to Bailey in Washington. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And as things stand to day, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps fought in August. So, Andrew Bailey wants to get back to focusing on fighting inflation, but they'll have to see how much the pension funds have fortified themselves during this interim period of emergency BOE support, the form that the Bank of England's help could be extended in, could be an extension of delay, the delayed quantitative tightening, or it could be an introduction of a new facility. We'll have to see how the guilt market reacts today. Okay, Lisi, thank you very much. Lisi, burden outside of very fitting, very rainy downing street. Now, let's get to our next guest who previously worked as a special advisor to Theresa May and David Cameron when they were serving as prime ministers. Now, he advises FTSE 100 companies and investors on how to navigate a volatile UK political landscape that's Alex Dawson, UK, country director at Global Council, Alex. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. So, how much longer does Lisi trust survive and doesn't even matter? I think it's really at most months, possibly, probably weeks, possibly days. To an extent, though, there's, she's not really in control anymore. So, it kind of doesn't matter in that respect. I think Jeremy Hunt is de facto UK Prime Minister at the moment. He calls the shots on this number one issue, which is about how the UK restores its fiscal credibility and all the sort of discretionary stuff that Lisi Trust wants to do. It's not really in her power anymore. Alex, good morning. How? How are you? Damaging was Friday night's press conference in Dianne Street, because I sat here in Dubai 5,200 miles away watching what can only be described to somebody didn't know what was in front of them, didn't know where to look, and didn't know the names of the journalists in the room. I think it was extremely damaging both in political and financial senses. I think it demonstrated that UK leadership wasn't really on the same plane as a lot of other folks. And I think you've got to walk and demonstrate a certain amount of competence at the very basic cost. They were briefed, Alex. Alex, they were briefed. They were briefed. Both Quasi Quattang and Lisi Trust were briefed. And I can tell you that factually were briefed before they came out with this version of the budget. They were told not to do it this way. I think they had spent too much time talking to a set of people that didn't necessarily get them to heed those warnings that they were being given and that they were replying. And that fatal mistake that they made was to try and go further and faster when it comes to their growth plan than they set out, frankly, in the leadership campaign. a cutting mix, and again...,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3749,2022-10-17 05:42:18
15464," And faster when it comes to their growth plan, then they set out, frankly, in the leadership campaign. A cut in nicks and canceling a corporation tax increase would have probably been manageable, but blowing the doors off to quote the Italian job and to scrap 45p to bring forward a 20p down to 19p income tax cut this year, both of which are now being cancelled. Alongside everything to do with IR35, stamp duty changes, etc, was just too much for markets to bear. And it surprised the political markets as well. And that's why she is in the very, very difficult position that she is now. Well, it's something she emphasized over and over again, nearly to every question she was asked on Friday. The markets were unhappy, not in those exact words, but something along those lines. The markets, we were surprised at the market reaction, the market was surprised at how fast, how far we went. What does it mean going forward, not just for the Tories, but for UK politics, to have this moment where markets essentially dictated a U-turn in policy? Well, it's not the first time we saw it with the global financial crisis. We, frankly, saw it in the late 70s with the IMF. And I think it's a little bit of a reversion to norm. Now, what it means when it comes to questions like the EU's post-Brexit settlement with the UK, what it means with fiscal conservatism is that I think it's all going to be much more embedded and probably much more treasury orthodoxy, ironically considering what Trussonomics was meant to come in and do as a consequence. And I think we're going to see that with the Labour Party as well. Now, there are 20, 30 points ahead. Surely that lead will probably diminish a little bit over the coming years, but you're going to see a Labour Party that's going to have to work out how you do supply side growth policy, how you do fiscal conservatism, and how you make sure that actually it's more equitable, you know, according to their political beliefs. There's a consequence of that. Can we square a couple of things away, Alex? Lots of talk over the weekend. I mean, the Labour Party are now on a election footing very clear from Kierstown. One wouldn't expect any other kind of rhetoric. Is there a real risk of an interim election between now and the end of the fixed term? I think there is a growing chance of it. I think if you have a situation where a significant number of Conservative MPs or ministers signal no confidence in the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister says, and you have a significant instance caucus within the Tory Party that says you can't just change Prime Minister again without reference to an election. It perhaps triggers one, but it's accidental. I mean most Tory MPs, they don't want to be facing the electorate right now because it's going to be the last such conversation they have with them. I saw this really interesting argument from Pippa Krier over at the Guardian and essentially said that the Tory should hold an election right now because essentially you get Labour in charge of a very tough economic environment. Therefore, meaning there's not permanent damage to the Tory, so they can come back and what do you make of that? I think it's too clever by two thirds. I mean, I think anyone who sort of tries to predict what the outcome of the next election is going to be in seven years time. They can't even say what the market is going to do when they open this morning. I think it's slightly fanciful. I think they should avoid listening to commentators, no matter how great a journalist Pippa Krier is since years, who come out with political strategy like that. That sounds almost like Trostonomics. Alex, what is what is Hunter Nomix? Hunter Nomix is Rishi Sunax, fiscal policy on steroids. He's going to go further and faster in terms of demonstrating fiscal competence than than anyone would ever imagine. Is there going to be a shocker of a tax rise that just blows the Donald Trump to quote you. It's quoting the Italian job, Alex. I think you'll end up with a surprising bloodiness when it comes to all of the measures being scrapped probably apart from the next cut from the growth plan. I also suspect that you might start to see some words about the spending side of things and how that's going to be reduced. You've got a series of very big commitments around NHS and defence spending that Trostonomics involved. There's a, you know, there's something that's left unsaid at the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3750,2022-10-17 05:46:26
15465," You've got a series of very big commitments around NHS and defence spending that Trosonomics involved. There's a, you know, there's something that's left unsaid at the moment, which is what happens to those big protected areas of spending. Alex, let's see what the day brings. Never mind the week. Alex Dawson, the UK, at Country Director for Global Council. Coming up in the show, the UK US bank earning season continues with Bank of America on the slate today. We have more in the story right here on Bloomberg. Music a digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Put the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. Yeah, watching Bloomberg, Deborah Kieriff, I'm Juliette Sallian, Singapore with the first word news. Well, Chinese president Xi Jinping says China is staying the course as it faces what he calls dangerous storms and growing challenges from the US. In an almost two hour speech to open the five-year-old communist party Congress, she said China would pursue development while ensuring national security. He also said Taiwan re-enhancation was a matter for the Chinese and held what he called the restoration of order in Hong Kong. A delayed statement from G20 finance ministers and central bankers has laid bare divisions on issues including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions, but clashes between major nations meant that this time it took three days. With her details of a revamp at Goldman Sachs, according to the Wall Street Journal, the bank plans to combine its flagship investment banking and trading businesses into one unit. It also plans to merge its asset and wealth management divisions. The reporter, the report rather, says the reorganization could be announced within days. And Rupert Murdoch wants to combine news, Corp. Fox, recreating the media behemoth he split apart nine years ago. The move would likely consolidate power in the hands of his son, Lockland, currently the CEO of Fox.

Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg QuickTech powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Manus. Jules, thank you very much. Jules, they're setting me agenda this Monday morning with the White House National Security Advisory General, Jake Sullivan, has told CNN that President Biden is re-evaluating U.S. study relations, and that's after the OPEC plus I put Kant leading to an escalating public dispute over oil. The president isn't going to act precipitously. He's going to act methodically, strategically, and he's going to take his time to consult with members of both parties and also to have an opportunity for Congress to return so that he can sit with them in person and work through the arms. Is halting arms, though? There's options include. As I was just saying, those options include changes to our approach to security assistance to Saudi Arabia. It's getting extremely tight around the collar here in the oil markets and rhetoric. Paul Wallace joins me out. He covers oil and energy from Dubai. This feud between the White House and the House of the side is in the Ascendant. The White House saying there's no market basis for the production cup. We've been through that. But from what you've seen, how escalated is this situation? It is. I mean, tensions between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia are at the worst for, I'd say, a very long time. Perhaps even worse than after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. I think what we're waiting for now is to see some concrete reaction from the U.S. They've made it very clear that they will do something, even if Jake Sullivan says that Joe Biden is going to act methodically. I think it's pretty clear that we're going to have to see something, whether it turns out to be purely a symbolic move that doesn't actually change much on the ground or something that really does hurt the Saudis remains to be seen. We're basically looking at two things, change or some kind of restriction in arms sales to from the U.S. to the Kingdom, or perhaps the no-peck bill being passed into law, which it's a big if, but it would certainly be very unwelcome in Saudi Arabia. OK, Danny. Well, the other variable, Paul, is China, of course. How surprised was the market by Xi Jinping doubling down on his COVID-19 strategy? Hi, Danny. I think in some ways the market took this sort of in its stride, if you were. And the consensus, at least among oil traders for a while now, I think, has been that China is not going to ease its COVID-19 restrictions any time soon, perhaps not at least until March next year, or maybe even beyond that. I would say it's pretty much the biggest thing at the moment affecting the market's outlook. A lot of oil bulls were saying, you know, only a few months ago, that, hey, just wait for China to reopen and you'll see oil consumption in the country go through the roof and that's going to send prices, you know, back to $120 a barrel and perhaps even higher. But that's obviously not happened. And I think oil traders are now reconciled to the fact that China is going to be under COVID-19 for at least several more months, if not even longer than that. I think it's interesting that oil has snapped higher this morning, really, isn't it, Paul, even on the back of those zero COVID comments. Let's see what frightens the world more, no peck or the arm sales, perhaps being interfered with 25% of US arm sales go to Saudi Arabia. Paul, thank you very much. Paul Wallace, I guess my colleague in Dubai on the oil market. Danny, what have we got? Well, we got US bank earnings, of course, Manus, because the season it continues today. We're going to get Bank of America report. It will report rather later today. We also got that Wall Street Journal scoop on Goldman Sachs to cover for you. All of that next, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3752,2022-10-17 05:55:03

The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage.

Jamie Diamond there who is speaking on JP Morgan's bank earnings call. And of course, he spoke about this idea. He got a lot of questions about his recession calls but basically said at JP Morgan, the cracks and credit, they're not showing up, it is still a healthy consumer. Mike Mayo over at Wells Fargo says that these results bowed well for the rest of the banking season. So let's get into the rest of the banking season. Bloomberg's David Scanlan joins us now. So David, we've got Bank of America on deck. Does that seem right to you that the first wave of bank earnings, JP Morgan, city, PNC financial that they do bowed well for what we're going to get later today? Certainly on the consumer side, Danny. And don't forget, these high interest rates have been terrible for the stock market, the bond market. But it can be very good for the banks, particularly like at JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America. They have big consumer businesses. And really the difference is just what are they paying out in deposits versus what they charge for loans. And as rates go higher, they simply take in more money. They're key metric, the net interest income for JP Morgan is going to be $62 billion this year. So very, very impressive. Obviously, on the other side of the ledgers, the investment banking, which has not been very strong at all. So IPOs are drying up, not a lot of mergers. So we saw that with Morgan Stanley. Pretty hard hit. Red knew down about 50%. So it really depends on which part of the bank you're talking about. So a big broad franchise, like a bank of America and JP Morgan, they have a lot more levers to pull to withstand what's a pretty tough market otherwise for banking. No question. David, do you think the Red Hot headline this morning, Goldman, to combine the investment banking and the trading is to try and make better use of flow and efficiency? Or is it trying to get out ahead of that slowed on that you've identified in the investment banking side, which is pervasive? This is a big move by Goldman. Yeah, the only thing constant it seems under David Solomon at Goldman is overhaul.

15468," Yeah, the only thing constant it seems under David Solomon at Goldman is is overhaul is about the third one in four years is really undoing some of the things he did just two years ago, but it is really about streamlining is about efficiencies. So they're going to combine the wealth management and the asset management businesses, which are pretty similar. You're managing money for your customers, but also the investment banking and the trading. The big move though, which we reported last week is the is cutting back on the retail business. That's probably the most significant move. The one that might have the most implications in terms of jobs in terms of cost, but they're trying to bring Goldman Sachs to the masses, if you will. Just hasn't really worked out. It's been a very expensive endeavor. It's not making any money. It's a very crowded space. Thank you so much, Ted. And things like that. Time has run against us, David. Bloomberg Market Europe is up next. This is Bloomberg. These flooring flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels laid on the surface of a reservoir. They can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest flooring solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plan was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. Good morning. Welcome to Bimberg Market, Europe. I'm Anna Edwards live in London.

15469," Downing streets, potsy, the UK's Liz Trass battles to rescue her premiership. The pound gains on expectations of more U-turns, as New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to make a fiscal statement today. Taking a stand, China's President Xi backs COVID-0 as his party congress and doubles down on policies at the centre of tensions with the United States. Chinese stocks slide. Plus, the EU plans to temporarily overhaul the continent's gas market with a dynamic price cap. It's latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills, watch as gas markets open this morning. We're just under an hour away from the start of cash equities trading here in Europe. Good morning, everybody. Another Monday morning. Let's have a look where the future's positioned us for the start of that trading session. So as I say, an hour away still. But this is what we have on the future's pictures. European futures looking a little bit sluggish. Down a quarter of 1% on the 1,100 DAX futures down a tenth of a percent. And of course, during Friday's session, we saw gains in Europe. But that was then followed by losses in the United States. So we were down by more than 3% in the US session on the NASDAQ at least during Friday's session, increasing inflation expectations, as per survey data, increasing expectations of Fed Hikes. Obviously, that was weighing on big tech during Friday's session. So that seems to be the big story in terms of the overall market setup. This is the US futures picture, which does look a lot brighter, as they say after that real weakness, in particular in tech in Friday's session. So NASDAQ features up by 910s of 1%. Let's roll on and have a look at the GMM. And it'll show you a pretty mixed picture coming through in Asia, down by 910s of 1% on the MSCIA's Pacific. A bit of weakness there in the Japanese market. Now, there is some weakness as you can see there in the CSI 300, but it's not much. We're flat really on that particular measure of Chinese stocks. And in fact, the Shanghai composite up by 310s of 1%. But we do see some Chinese tech coming under pressure. We also see the Hang saying down by 410s of a percent. So maybe overstating it to say that we're selling off on Xi's speech. Where we got pretty defiant message, of course, on Taiwan, of focus on geopolitics, of focus on technological battles. But we are seeing certainly that adding to nervousness today. We see the pound on the GMM jumping by just under 1% as we mentioned in our headlines. We are seeing that rally in the pound on expectations of, well, maybe more U-turns to come. U-turn after U-turn from the UK government. A new chancellor now in post. And he is set to make a statement later on today. Let us focus in on the UK political story. And what that means from our case, Liz Truss coming under intense questioning from journalists during her press conference in Downing Street. Well, intense for four minutes. She delivered a eight-minute combined statement and Q&A. That was on Friday, utter sacking, of course. Her chancellor, Liz Truss, was repeatedly asked if she could last as prime minister. Prime Minister, clearly a difficult day. Can you explain to the public why you think you should remain as prime minister, given you jumped a key tax cut that led you to be elected and got rid of your chancellor? You, the one that wanted to cut the 45-P rate, you still have a platform to win the leadership of the Conservative Party on a platform to cut corporation tax. You and the chancellor, the ex-chancellor, designed this budget together in lockstep, we're told. It times in secret the two of you. He has to go because of the fallout from here. How come you get to stay? Excuse the bluntness prime minister, but given everything that has happened, what credibility do you have to continue governing? The former Tory chancellor, Hammond, who has just said that you have totally trashed the Tory party's election-winning reputation for economic competence. Will you apologise to your party? I'm absolutely determined to see through what I have promised. Well, my priority is making sure we deliver the economic stability that our country needs. What I've done today is made sure that we have economic stability in this country. Well, I am determined to deliver on what I set out. So, some repetition of the questions and indeed in the answers. Let's get now to our colleague, Lizzie Burton, who is in Downing Street, for us. Lizzie, what do we expect then from Jeremy Hunt's statement later, which if you're just keeping up, fourth chancellor so far this year, is Trussonomics dead then? Well, un-Trussonomics is being sold for parts in exchange for market stability. You heard the press conference there. Very little sign of detail or an uphol-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3755,2022-10-17 06:08:30
15470," Well Anna Trussonomix is being sold for parts and exchange for markets stability. You heard the press conference there. Very little sign of detail or an apology from Liz Truss. So we've heard from the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt over the weekend. We're expecting to hear from him at 11am today and 3.30pm London time in the commons. And we can expect yet more screeching new turns. Bloomberg economic says they need to find £24billion worth of savings on public spending and in terms of revenue raises. And this is Hunt turning Trussonomix into what Rishi Sunak would have done had he been Chancellor. So Hunt very much the strongest most powerful person in government now, which begs the question, why is Liz Truss in number 10 at all? Three MPs, Tory MPs have publicly called for her to quit behind the scenes. Tory MPs are asking, should they gamble now on a new leader or wait for inevitable annihilation in 2024? They're going to be watching the guilt markets today, Anna, that you've already seen the pound lifted in Asia trading. But the guilt market is going to be without the BOE's stabilisers today. So be watching out for that. Yeah, absolutely just 55 minutes then until we see the start of guilt trading at Lizzie and we will look to see how it manages without the support of the Bank of England. Given the issues surrounding pension funds and their reliance on guilt markets and hedging, Lizzie, thanks so much. Bimbo's Lizzie Birdon, who is in Downing Street, I can confirm the umbrella is slightly getting in the way of the view. But yeah, I hope she manages to stay broadly dry. Let us bring in another voice on this conversation. Benjamin Jones joins us in Vesco, who is the CEO of EMEA's director of macro research, who has found a dry place to spend the day. Benjamin, very good to see you today. Let me ask you about your expectations or maybe the broader market's expectations for what we need to hear here and now from the new chancellor. We are expecting him to make a statement around the fiscal situation today. Although the full fiscal update is still scheduled for the 31st of October, what is the near term focus for markets? Yeah, good morning, Anna. Thank you. It's tricky to say, really. I mean, I think whatever Jeremy Hunt says today, it's not going to be enough to fully stabilize markets because we are still going to be remaining with this big question of who is going to be the leader of the Conservative Party and the Prime Minister going forward. And that is going to be an enormous uncertainty. And even if Liz trustworthy to go and that was a change, I don't think that would significantly change matters. So I think we're in for a period where UK credibility is continually questioned and UK assets remain incredibly volatile for a significant period of time. And Jeremy Hunt try his might to take a more fiscally responsible hand. I don't think it's going to change matters too quickly. Now, yes, he might be able to to temper things. And as Lizzie was just saying there, I think watching the guilt market is going to be absolutely key for determining whether markets do believe that he is that more stable hand. And if he is going to be able to push those policies through, because I think at the moment you're going to get this very much sort of push and pull between the front and the back benches on the Conservative Party. So I think we're in for a very difficult time for guilt and for sterling trading going forward. Yes, and whatever was said on Friday, we played some clips of that press conference and some announcements were made, A U Turn was made around corporations acts. It seems to be enough to change the direction of the nervousness in guilt markets ben during Friday session. So I suppose the risks now are around the politics as discussed, but also the readiness of the market to stand on its own two feet, the readiness of pension markets and their hedging strategies to stand on their own two feet as we start another week of guilt trading. Do you have any thoughts on that front? Yeah, that is actually I mean, the thing we have to hope is that the Bank of England last week was was able to buy enough time for pension funds to sort their liquidity and margin issues out. And then as you go into to trace today's trading session little under an hour, that they've able to do enough and we just have to wait and see really. The problem is that this is coming at a period where obviously we're seeing this political uncertainty and this this lack of credibility already coming on the back of a backdrop where liquidity was fairly tight. I remember that this is not a world where we were sitting 12 months ago where liquidity was easy and central banks were very stepping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3756,2022-10-17 06:12:33
15471," He was fairly tight. We have to remember that this is not a world where we were sitting 12 months ago where liquidity was easy and central banks were very stepping at every sign of stress. I think what we've seen very, very clearly over the last couple of weeks is that central banks are going to be much more selective about how they tackle these periods of market stress. So, yes, we got that period of QE last week from the Fed, but it was very short lived and it was very targeted. Whereas, if you think back to what we've lived with over the last 15 years, at any sort of market stress, central banks would have come in with absolute swathes of liquidity and just sort of blanket it the market with support. But given the inflation problem that we have, it is exceptionally difficult for them to do that now. So, I think actually the bank of England is going to be a lot less forthcoming with support of the first sign of stress and there are unfortunately things that are going to break. Okay, yes, and as you point out, yes, that move from the Bank of England, what look like quantitative easing, of course, describe differently and described and cast as something much more targeted by the bank itself. We will look to see how markets perform on that front. We'll have more. We've been Jones, in Vesco, in me, at our banks, we have macro research. Shortly, we'll get to a wider broader conversation around markets. Let me just get this and break your news around. China, just one headline with not a lot of detail, but China asking top LNG importers to hold resales to foreign buyers. This, of course, a real focus for markets, the supply of LNG around the world, as we see Russian gas, either not delivered or not wanted in various parts of the world. Then many countries have been relying on LNG, their ability to import it and the availability of it. We see natural gas prices actually on the move a little bit here in Europe down, in fact, by 2.5% so not responding too much to this right now. But broadly, that is not too much of a big movement, in fact, in gas prices, given what we do sometimes see. Now, more on gas markets later on, we've got some reporting around that to cover. But let's get to some of our top stories this morning. A first-world news update with Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Anna. Chinese president Xi Jinping says China is staying in the course as it faces what he calls dangerous storms and growing challenges from the US. In an almost two-hour speech to open the five-year-lead Communist Party Congress, she says China would pursue development while ensuring national security. He also said Taiwan reunification was a matter for the Chinese and hailed what he called the restoration of order in Hong Kong. A senior White House official says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Riyadh after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production. A delayed statement from G-25 Anzmunist's and Central Bankers had laid bare division on issues including Russia's war in Ukraine and ways to deal with climate change. The statement was based on meetings last week as part of the IMF and World Bank's annual gatherings in Washington. It's usually released within hours of those discussions, but clashes between major nations meant that this time it took three days. We've heard details of a revamp at Goldman Sachs. According to the Wall Street Journal, the bank plans to combine its flagship investment banking and trading businesses into one unit. It also plans to merge its asset and wealth management divisions. The reporter says the reorganisation could be announced within days. Global news, 20-hrs a day.

Coming up on the program, the new plan that EU is considering to tackle the growing energy crisis will have all of the details about that. Plus, China's president Xi, as we heard from Alice, kicking off the party congress by defending policies including the Hong Kong crackdown and COVID-0. We will be live in Beijing shortly for an update. Next, the Fed's Jim Bullard leaves, open the possibility that the central bank could do back-to-back 75 basis point hikes.

There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realise that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel, to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. Multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Whether the committee would want to pull some proposed or thought of policy rate increases from 2023 into the December meeting, I think that's a judgment it's premature to make. While my expectation is that rates are going to have to move higher for a sustained period, I do see risks around moving to abruptly to this new higher level. Moving too fast can disrupt financial markets and the economy in a way that ultimately could be self-defeating. That was St Louis Fed President James Bullard there on the possibility of a larger hike in December and Kansas Fed President Esther George saying it would be risky to hike rates too fast. Many views available. It seems still very focused on the hikes though overall at the Fed. Benjamin Jones is still with us in Mexico, in me a director of macro research. And we saw stock settling off on Friday, which was interesting on expectations survey data suggesting expectations of inflation are becoming more entrenched. But your overall take on inflation at this point is still that it is either has peaked or is peaking. What are the best indicators that you're looking at to suggest that the worst could be over on that front? Yeah, look obviously Thursday's inflation print last week was a little bit disappointing for anybody that thought the Fed was going to slow down their pace of high hikes. But I think if you look at some of the faster moving data, there are indications that some of the services inflation is potentially close to peaking out. Now, I think it is services inflation. We need to look up more closely because we know that goods inflation already has peaked out and there are good signs of that is continuing to come down. So if we look at things like the Zillow rent for example measure that's starting to come lower already and that tends to be a reasonably good leading indicator of the official rental inflation in the CPI basket. Obviously things like airfares that came in a lot stronger, I'd be watching that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3758,2022-10-17 06:20:35
15473," a reasonably good leading indicator of the official rental inflation in the CPI basket. Obviously things like AFRs, that came in a lot stronger. I'd be watching that very closely. Again, that was a disappointing number on Thursday. But as we start to see the consumer getting squeezed more broadly, some of those real incomes starting to bite or consumers I'd expect to start to see that slowing down. So I'd be watching AFRs. And again, if that disappoints and continues to surprise higher, then I maybe have to start adjusting my view a little bit. But that would be something I'd be watching. The healthcare one is again, something I'd be watching closely as well. And there's a lot of interesting dynamics there on the way that healthcare inflation is calculated. And it is a different calculation, look at PC and CPI. But the CPI measures should start to come down over the course of the next year, just because of the technicalities of the way that they are calculating. I think that will act as somewhat of a drag going forward. OK, so that's where you see the role over in inflation, where that story comes from. Tell us about the timing between that and profits and the market bottom, because not all of those things have set to happen together. And indeed, a weaker inflation environment might play badly for margins. And I'm not sure how risk assets deal with that. Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you, that's my best case scenario. What I want to see is some real pressure on margins. What I want to see is some real pressure on earnings. And obviously, we're in the midst of Q3 earnings season now. So we hope to get some indication of that. And the reason that I say that is because markets do tend to bottom after you've seen earnings fall a reasonable amount. But before they bottom, typically markets will bottom around about eight to nine months before earnings do. So that idea that markets are certainly forward looking. But unfortunately, what you do tend to have to see is earnings real, trailing earnings, having come down, but also earnings expectations coming down. Now again, there is some size of that in the market. It's not entirely even. We're still getting some reasonably good numbers coming out of the energy sector, for example, and that's going to pull the overall earnings growth up. But in other sectors, you are starting to see some earnings contraction. And you are starting to see, as we go through Q3 earnings season, earnings expectations coming down, has it been enough not yet? And I guess my fear is that because corporates and households have very strong balance sheets, that that sort of coming earnings down draft just takes longer to come through. And then we're in these very choppy, very volatile markets, but with a general sort of downward drift for a longer period of time. I think this time is very unlike March 2020, for example, where you got a very sharp drop in markets. You got a very sharp drop in earnings. You had that sort of catharsis in the market. You had that capitulation. And then investors were able to look through this and get back in and we were able to resume an uptrend. We're not in that type of environment now. It is more of a slow car crash, if you will, in terms of the earnings story that is coming out. So I think we need to see some of that weakness coming through. And that will allow investors to say, okay, there is enough pessimism. There is enough bearish in the market. Now we stand if we can start to buy. But unfortunately, I think we're a little ways away from that. And I'd be looking for further weakness going into the end of this year. Okay. Thanks Ben. Thanks so much for joining.

15474," What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets, Europe, 40 or so minutes until the start of cash equity trading and we look to catch up with the weakness on Wall Street on Friday. The US futures are decidedly higher this morning. President Xi Jinping delivered a defiant message to the world in a speech at the Communist Party Congress that China is ready to stand its ground. She also signaled no change in direction for two main risk factors dragging the economy down, strict COVID rules and housing market policies. Let's bring in Bloomberg's China government reporter, Colin Murphy. Colin will dive into some of the specifics here but before we do, what were some of the main takeaways for you? There's a whole range of takeaways, obviously ranging from the economy to common prosperity, to technology, military, Taiwan, US, so on and so forth. I think one of the most immediate ones that people are looking to is COVID-0. And on COVID-0, he defended his signature policy and said that it does work for China that it has protected people and the economy here. He avoided giving any timeline for changes to that strategy. And the strategy has become really problematic in recent weeks and months. As more and more people here are increasingly frustrated with COVID-0 restrictions and how it's impacting their daily lives and also the economy. Yes, a lot of people writing about how COVID-0, you know, backing away from it, although some taking comfort, perhaps from the fact that it wasn't a specific focus with very detailed new policies in that regard, but you know, maybe that's people clutching its drawers. What's on the cards then for the next few days because this was just the start of the Congress? Right, so this, as you say, was the sort of kickoff of the whole event which will last for about a week. During this week, we'll go a little bit quiet in terms of like official insights into what's going on. The delegates will gather, have meetings, discussions and there will be certain areas such as corruption that will be given closer focus. They'll also be debating and discussing the work paper that was presented in draft form. And then they'll reconvene on Saturday, which is the final day of the Congress. And at that time, we'll get some voting action on the different elements. And of course, that will lead to sort of a wrap-up speech, a short one from Xi Jinping himself on Saturday. And then shortly after that, most probably on Sunday, we will have this big reveal of who is going to be in the top veterans of Chinese leadership for the next five years. And that almost certainly looks to include Xi, of course, as the number one. Okay, so a lot of focus on China over the week ahead. Colin, thanks very much. Brimbo's Colin Murphy with the highlights so far from Xi's speech. She focused very much on geopolitics and technological composition. And we'll continue, as Colin says, to monitor what's going on behind the scenes and with those more detailed meetings, perhaps. And then, front and center, with Xi himself once again next weekend. Now, just to tell you what's going on in markets, we do see a little bit of weakness in the gas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3760,2022-10-17 06:29:31
15475," and with those more detailed meetings perhaps. And then, Fronton said to me, she himself wants to get next weekend. Now, just to tell you what's going on in markets, we do see a little bit of weakness in the gas prices morning, perhaps responding more to the capping plan that will get more details on shortly around Europe than our reporting about what's going on in China, which could have been putting upward pressure on gas prices. We're not seeing that right now. Natural gas prices in Europe, down by 6.3%. Coming up, we'll get back to UK politics, though. Britain's beleaguered Prime Minister Liz Truss is backing to rescue her premiership. We are expecting to hear from the new chancellor today. More details to follow. How much of that is true? How confident did you actually over achieve? Did you back then realize that we would be using AI in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today. But I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or 10 years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place. But I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this day, we still know very little about how the brain works. But these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel, in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things because AI or machine learning has become so good at so many things that, what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe half an hour until the start of cash equity trading here are your top stories. Downing Street Hot Seat, the UK's Liz Trass battles to rescue her premiership, the pound gains on expectations of more U-turns as new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to make a fiscal statement today. Taking a stand, China's President Xi backs COVID-0 at his party Congress and doubles down on policies at the centre of tensions with the United States, Chinese stocks are weaker.

15476," is latest efforts to rein in soaring energy bills. Natural gas prices drop. Welcome back to the program every half an hour then until the start of our trading day and our trading week. And the European futures picture looks a little bit weaker, but actually the Kekkeirol stands out as a mover higher by two tenths of 1% broadly. We're looking to catch up with Wall Street. On Friday, we saw expectations of higher inflation, looking more entrenched, and that led to higher expectations of rate highs, and therefore wait on tech stocks. So the NASDAQ was down by more than 3% of Friday's session. We looked to catch up with that today, but it should say the US features two point higher, so that could be something of a turn in sentiment as we get later on in the day. Let's get a blue-bank business flash. Top corporate series we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. Hi, Anna. We've heard details of a revamp at Goldman Sachs, according to the Wall Street Journal, the bank plans to combine its flagship investment banking and trading businesses into one unit. It also plans to merge its asset and wealth management divisions. The reporter says the reorganization could be announced within days. Rupert Murdoch wants to combine newscorp and Fox recreating the media giant he split apart nine years ago. The move would likely consolidate power in the hands of his son, Lacklin, currently the CEO of Fox. So far, none of the Murdoch clan have spoken publicly about the deal, but the company's acknowledged it was in the works on Friday. Mercedes is broadening its battery-powered line-up with the new sports utility vehicles. The game is to take on Tesla's model Y, the carmaker's latest step to go all-electric by the end of the decade. The EQV SUV is the fourth model to use Mercedes-Dedicated EV platform. We spoke with CEO Ola Kalaneas, who says the energy crisis may hasten the move into renewables. Europe, in particular, will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany, that has been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short-to-midterm challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer, mid to long-term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. That's your Bloomberg Business Flash, Anna. Very much, Alice Hanks joining us with the Business Flash. Now, the UK's fourth chancellor of the EXJECA in as many months has spoken to the media, following his appointment on Friday. In the wake of quasi-quarting's sacking, here's what Jeremy Hunt told the BBC. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can, because our long-term health depends on being a low tax economy, and I very strongly believe that. So long-term commitment still to tax cutting, but certainly a different emphasis in the short term, and nothing is off the table, he said, not being bound by the plans of his predecessor. Let us bring in Bloomberg's Lizzie Burton, who's in Downing Street for us. So Lizzie, give us the state of play on Trussonomics then right now. Well, Anna, Trussonomics is rapidly being turned into soon-acconomics, on steroids as a former guest on Bloomberg TV this morning has put it, all so that Truss can calm the markets. If you think back to Friday's press conference with the Prime Minister, it like detail, it lacks an apology. So over the weekend, the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, as you heard there, made clear that he is planning more U-turns. We're going to hear from him at 11 a.m., and then again at 3.30 p.m., there's going to have to be a lot of reversals, including on revenue raising and spending cuts, if this government is to balance the books. Our economist at Bloomberg Economics say that he's going to have to find 24 billion pounds worth. So Trussonomics seems to be dead in the water, which begs the question, what's the point of having Lys Truss at number 10? Certainly a question that Tory MPs are asking themselves, three have asked it publicly. And behind the scenes, they're asking, should they gamble on a new leader now, or wait for 2024 when they'll seem to face certain annihilation? But they'll be watching the guilt market very closely today, the stabilizers from the Bank of England are off. But we have already seen the pound lifted in Asia trading, because of the seemingly sealed fate of Truss and Trussonomics. Yeah, talking about the stabilizers coming off the guilt market, then Lizzie, today is the day where they start trading without that support that buying from the Bank of England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3762,2022-10-17 06:38:52
15477," the fate of trust and trust dynamics. Yeah, talking about the stabilizers coming off the guilt market then Lizzie today is the day where they start trading without that support that buying from the bank of England. The plan as Bailey said coming to an end on Friday, but there are still other measures of support or other support measures, sorry, in the market at this time. Bring us up to date with the B.O.E. plan. Well, the hope is that there will be more support from the bank of England that Andrew Bailey will take inspiration from Mario Draghi and do whatever it takes. But we heard from the governor over the weekend at the IMF and he seems very determined to refocus on his mission of inflation fighting. Indeed, he said that it's probably going to need a bigger interest rate rise at the November meeting in a few weeks. If they're going to account for all of the fiscal developments that have been in the work since August, take a listen to Bailey in Washington. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And as things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps fought in August. So what we may get today if the market turmoil continues is another delay to quantitative tightening or the introduction of a new facility, but really it's going to depend on how much pension funds have done to fortify themselves in this period of theory intervention. Okay, Lizzie, thanks very much. Moeberg's Lizzie Borden with an update from a fairly damp downing street this morning. Let's bring into the conversations, Jean-Arlie Poonani, who is the chief UK economist at Credit Suisse. So, Marley, very good to have you with us. So I suppose you've been running the numbers just as every all other economists have been around. They unfunded tax cuts. The extent of the U-turns we've already heard from those. According to the the IFS, there were 60 billion pounds worth of unfunded tax cuts. And we've you turned on around a third of that now when you look at the top rate of tax and the corporate the corporation tax. What's your assessments of where you've got to where we've got to on that particular story? Yeah, sure. I mean, I think about, you know, out of the 2% of tax cuts that were announced, you know, 0.9% have been reversed. Having said that, you know, still a lot needs to be done. We need, you know, spending cuts or tax rises of about 30 to 40 billion to stabilize debt to GDP in the medium term. So, you know, still a lot more new turns need to come in the next few days. And, you know, as we heard today, we have Jeremy Hunt announcing something. So, so let's see where we have what we have on that front. Yes, what kind of assumptions are you making this? And finally, at this point, in terms of spending cuts or or tax rises, I mean, those tax rises could come in the form of delayed implementation of some of the some of the tax cuts that have been mentioned already. All we could see turning around some of the narrative around windfall taxes and going after a wider tax base, perhaps around energy. I mean, what are the sort of levers that we could see in play? Yeah, I mean, there are so many options on the table that, you know, we can't really rule anything out. I mean, one of the options that has been discussed is even to reduce the investment spending that has been penciled in the previous plan. You know, the initial plan was to get investments spending up to two and a half percent of GDP. You know, some of that could be cut. We could have something on on benefits. As you said, you know, we could even you turn on windfall taxes because that's, you know, a big source of revenue that can pay for at least some of the energy price guarantee that the government is doing. So I think, you know, at this point, as as you know, the chancellor said over the weekend, everything is on the table. And I think in the next few days, we will hear from the government what it is. Exactly. That's been that's been the final plan, what it looks like. But I think a lot of the the tax cuts are going to be you turn in the next few days. What kind of hiking are you expecting to see from the Bank of England? I see a headline across the Bloomberg says that traders are pairing their wages or their betting on Bank of England rate hikes. They now see the key rates peaking at 5.36% by May. What kind of peak do you put on interest rates in the UK? I think, you know, the Bank of England would have to have a very strong credible response in November when they meet, I think we heard from. And really that that's something that they're applying to do when they take into account the fiscal plan. So we have a look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3763,2022-10-17 06:43:16
15478," that's something that they are applying to do when they take into account the fiscal plan. So we are looking for 100 basis points hike in November and then we think that the Bank of England would continue hiking to a four and a half percent by early 2023. So our forecast for the terminal rate is lower than where the market pricing is currently. But we think that if the Bank of England can show credibility in November that can actually bring the risk premium down and also reduce the market pricing in the next few days. But for that we need a credible response in November. What about the inflation story from here then, Shunali? Because of course the market is going to be very focused on the fiscal side of things. The market has been focused on fighting inflation and wanted to see more of a focus on that from from fiscal actors. And thinking about inflation, we get the latest inflation print on Wednesday which could once again add another dimension to this. I see that the survey number suggests we'll get 10% inflation. So back into double digits again. What's at stake for you on Wednesday? Yeah, I mean we actually have an above consensus call for Wednesday. We think inflation will go up to 10.1%. But having said that, the energy price guarantee does limit the increase in the near term on inflation. So inflation is likely to now peak at 10 and a half instead of going up to much higher rates depending on where the gas prices are. So given that the government has kept the amount of energy built that everyone's paying, I think in the near term, there are inflation is probably going to be less than what have been the case. Otherwise, having said that depending on what the fiscal support looks like, it will definitely add to medium term inflationary pressures, which obviously the Bank of England would need to counter by raising rates. So I think even though in the near term inflation might be lowered due to the fiscal support in the medium term inflation should be higher and that should mean more pressure on the Bank of England. I mean if you look at the numbers from the US, I think the story is that the central banks are a long way away from being able to control inflation and we're not seeing that kind of slow down that everyone has been hoping for and wishing for. So I think it is too early for central banks to start pivoting on rates and I think the Bank of England is in a similar, if not more aggravated situation. Yeah, in pursuit of that peak it just seems to get more and more difficult to find. What about the role of house prices? Clearly a big part of the UK consume a confidence story, Jean-Ali and the UK economy as well. The latest headlines out of right moves suggest that perhaps at least asking prices are holding up but there's an expectation of something much more negative to come. So London is leading the UK home asking prices to their biggest gain in months. That's the most recent headline out of right move but right move saying they see signs of a slow down as buyer demand slumps some 15%. Yeah, no, I think the outlook for the housing market is looking quite weak. Now we've seen there's been a lot of tightening of financial conditions. The two-year swap rate has gone up which basically means that new mortgages are going to be now remogaged at a higher rate. So if this financial volatility continues that definitely puts downside risk to the housing market, it puts downside risk to our growth forecast and I think if this market tightening continues and the financial conditions look like what they look today, it definitely puts downside risk to our forecast and we think that the recession could be deeper than what we've been sold in our base case. Jean-Ali, thanks so much for your time. Jean-Ali Pannoni, Chief UK economist at Credit Suisse with her perspective on the UK economy, will turn to the Eurozone shortly. Coming up, the EU has a plan wider than the Eurozone. Sorry, apologies. The European Union has a plan to rein in the bloc's energy crisis involving its biggest gas market intervention. It's biggest gas marketplace. There's a big intervention plan there. We'll get details shortly. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3764,2022-10-17 06:47:13
15479," Music A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Cook the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. If you have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. Music This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. You have to look at UK and it's been a Greek tragedy what we've seen in UK over the course of the last week with some of the policy announcements in the back and forth. We're at risk of talking ourselves into a worse position than we are. You know, this is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. Also in some of the other markets where housing is a major component of their economy. So whether it's Hong Kong or Australia, you start to wonder if they aren't the next ones to look. The Chinese economy has been in a recession for some considerable time. In the real economy, for example, bankruptcies, we see already bankruptcies increase. You know, it started in Spain in Europe and then the UK very clearly. And now it's reaching Italy and then France and Germany. To me, the next risk in markets, the next downturn, is the realization that the economies in after slow a substantial amount to meet those inflation goals. It doesn't mean the whole world is going up and smokes simultaneously. But when you have a situation where we've had very low interest rates for so long and the world was adapted to it, adapted to it. Now the central banks are raising interest rates. It changes things. Some of our guests are on where the next recession could be. What is the next shoot to drop? Let's pivot our conversation to Europe. Now the European Commission plans to put forward a dynamic price cap on the EU's biggest gas exchange. It's part of a range of measures to tackle the energy crisis. That is according to a draft document of the plan seen by Bloomberg. I'm pleased to say Maria today joins us here in London this morning. Maria, very nice to see you. In person this morning. So tell us what it is hard enough to understand price caps broadly. Now we have a dynamic price cap. What is that? Yes. And Anna, that was the first question I put to a source yesterday. I was like, what is a dynamic price cap? You need to really explain this because dynamic, what does it mean? So it's actually what it, the fundamentals of this. If you go back a few weeks ago, the European Commission has been clear that the TTF no longer reflects the price dynamics. This is the Dutch benchmark. Exactly. For gas prices, they say this doesn't really reflect their real dynamics. We're moving into LNG with moved away from Russian gas. There's a lot of speculation going here. So there has been a debate as to do you cap it entirely? Is it a way to put a limit on it? There's countries of course, you know, very well Germany, the Dutch, who say if you do that then, you know, it's a brutal market. You may not get the supply. So that is also dangerous. This dynamic, what it does is essentially would allow some buy-in and sell on a free market basis. But once you go past a point, you do a limit up. The transaction is closed. The key question is, what's a percentage swing that you would allow on a daily basis? And what is that price limit? That from what I understand has not been decided. But it really is the key as to whether or not a dynamic price cap works or not. Yeah, absolutely. And where have they set versus what Asian buyers are paid worth?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3765,2022-10-17 06:51:41
15480," from what I understand has not been decided, but it really is the key as to whether or not a dynamic price of works are not necessarily. Yeah, absolutely. And wherever it is set versus what Asian buyers up at worth willing to pay, also a key question. So that's how it could work then in theory. A lot of detail still to understand, but how likely is it to tools that this gets implemented? And by the way, Anna, there's a story that we've had this morning suggesting that the Chinese are now telling their own gas importers do not sell or resell in this market, because you don't know what's going to happen in the winter. You really need to keep the stocks up. So it is a brutal market out there. Now in terms of the dynamic or not, and we're going to get a deal by the end of the week. Remember, Vunderlion promised a major intervention by the end of the week. We know the European leaders will gather in Brussels. I'll be there, by the way, so we're back home. It's so exciting. On the Thursday, Friday, and there needs to be some type of political deal. Tomorrow, we're expecting a document finally, an executive roadmap, but then it comes down to the 27. And I think they're very far apart. You know, I've never heard anyone tell me there's consensus already in a Monday, but you know, four days of Brussels is a lot. Four days, yes. OK. You're afraid a lot of things can change. OK, so I'm sure between your visit to London and you getting back to Brussels, there are no more conversations will be had on this front. OK, Maria, thank you very much. Maria, today, we're here with us in London, but back in Brussels later on in the week. Let's get a Bloomberg first web news update. The top stories we're covering this morning, his Alice. Hi, Anna Goldman Sachs is downgrading its outlook for growth in the UK. That's after Prime Minister Liz Truss replaced her chancellor and road back on counselling and increase in corporation tax. The bank says it now expects a more significant recession. Annual growth for 2023 is now minus 1% down from minus 0.4%. Chinese president Xi Jinping says China is staying the course as it faces what he calls dangerous storms and growing challenges from the US. In an almost two-hour speech to open the five-year-old Communist Party Congress, she said China would pursue development while ensuring national security. He also said Taiwan reunification was a matter for the Chinese and held what he called the restoration of order in Hong Kong. A senior White House official says the US could change its approach to providing security assistance to Saudi Arabia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told CNN that President Biden could make a decision on relations with Riyadh after consulting with lawmakers following November's midterm elections. Biden told CNN last week there would be consequences for Saudi Arabia after it voted for OPEC to cut oil production.

Alice, thank you very much, Alice Atkins here in London. Coming up, we will look at your stocks to watch, including the German-based energy company RWE. As the EU plans to tackle the blocs energy crisis, we were just hearing more about that from Maria, the concept of a dynamic price cap being discussed. More developments on that front this week will get the lowdown, though, on the energy sector and the stocks to watch. This is playback. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates. The second generation expands and the third generation destroys.

The situation became dire with the stage. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets, Europe's 7 minutes until the start of cash equity trading. Futures are negative broadly, but we do see a little bit of green on the screen as well. US futures certainly looking green this morning and expectations of a rise of 7-8 tenths of a present on the major markets there. Let's get into the individual stocks we're watching. Tom McKenzie joins us and get at the European market open and Tom. Take us through. Good morning. Take us through the stocks you're watching starting with the energy sector. Yes. I know you're unpacking this story with Maria today in the studio just a few minutes ago around this dynamic pricing facility. At least mechanism the officials and Brussels are trying to put together. So the implications of course for utility companies across the Eurozone. We pulled out RWE as one example to look at, of course, a major producer and provider of electricity. So we know that officials are looking at this transfer facility. So the Dutch, titled transfer facility, the TTF in which is housed essentially the benchmark for gas trading across the Eurozone. So they want to decrease that volatility. You would expect that's going to be a benefit for the likes of RWE. Of course, we've got to get signed off by the leaders possibly on October 20th, 21st when they meet. Okay, so that's the story around energy. What about the telecom sector, Vodafone to New Slow? So yes, this is a JV that's been announced between Vodafone and Altis to provide fiber to home services in Germany. What it means for Vodafone is that they're going to be getting about 1.2 billion euros transferred from Altis over a period of time. And together the JV is expected to invest about 7 billion euros in providing these services to Germany. So see the reaction to Vodafone on the back of that news. And some news flows around being a source of the British fast fashion company. Yeah, this company is really struggling. The stock is down about 80% year to date. They came out with a profit warning and a downgraded forecast in June. And the reporting of the weekend is that ASOS has been reworking its banking facilities. Its credit facilities essentially to give it what it says is greater flexibility. But this has stopped us being hit very badly. The cost of living crisis, the squeeze on consumers. So they've had to ensure that they do have that funding in place and that liquidity to tie them over. And we had that reporting out over the weekend on ASOS. OK, thanks very much. Thanks to Tom for that Tom McKenzie, a colleague there with the start of trading in the sense of stocks to watch for. Let me tell you about what else we're watching for. We just had confirmation in the last few minutes actually from the Bank of England. A statement around the ending of its guilt operations. Remember, these were brought in to try and calm the market, find some space for the market to deal with some of the hedging strategies put in place by pension funds. So perhaps enough time is finished found. We will see what happens to guilt trading at the start of our trading day. That due in just minutes from now, of course. So the Bank of England after the market has to sell their own to you. And see if you think this is going back. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3767,2022-10-17 06:59:49
15482," There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Plus, the EU plans to temporarily overhaul the continent's gas market with a dynamic price cap. It's the latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills. So Tom, given all of that, if you look at the futures, it's definitely a cautious start to the week. So a lot of these futures are down between, well, one tenth of a percent and two tenths of a percent. The focus, of course, is on China putting, I guess, extra concern out there and we're also starting into earning season. Yeah, and the market verdict, importantly, of course, on the new Chancellor of the Exchequer who was out on the airwaves over the weekend, trying to reassure the markets. That was central to all of his comments that he gave over the weekend. And we're going to get that important statement from the new Chancellor, as we said, at around 11 a.m. Before he addresses the comments at 3.30 p.m., that is the expectations. So the market's opening in the green just about in Spain. You're seeing gains of 5.10 of a percent. The FTSE 100 up by just three points, again, as equity markets have start to open on the back of what was happening. The losses of last week, the concerns, of course, about the volatility and the political unrest, essentially, and breakdown here in the UK. The catcrime over in France, getting three tenths of a percent. Let's switch it on, because really the primary of the focus today is not the equity markets in the UK. It is all about the guilt. The pound has gained, yes, but we want to see what happens in the bond markets as we lead up to that statement from the new UK Chancellor. The future states are appointed to gains of 7.10 of a percent officials. Fed officials continue to say that you may need to see further and more aggressive hikes. That was after, by the way, the University of Michigan Survey in terms of sentiment around inflation came in higher than expected.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3768,2022-10-17 07:04:29
15483," that you may need to see further and more aggressive hikes. That was after, by the way, the University of Michigan Survey in terms of sentiment around inflation came in higher than expected. We know that that is important for Jade Powell in terms of how he assesses the rate hike path going forward. The US-10, you're currently at 396, that is a move lower by five basis points. So a bit of a bid for US Treasury's the benchmark at least gains for the pound of 810s of 8%. And you just see a pick up on the back of the news that the Chancellor will be giving this statement. And some speculation around further, you turns, more you turns to this mini-dependent current trading, 112 for the pound. Brent is at $92.00 per hour. That is again of 910s of 8%. Let's look at guilt's then on this important day in terms of that market reaction to yes, another Chancellor of the Exchequer. We'll switch it over again. The BoE coming out of the statement as well, a few minutes ago, saying that they have and confirming that they did indeed end those bond purchases on Friday, saying that the operations did inject greatest stability into the financial system, the repo operations, of course, remain in terms of that access for some of those funds. So here's how things are playing out then across the guilt curve. A little bit of a mixed picture, as you can see, with a 30 year at 461. Now it's all shaping up. You had a few seconds where things had to rattle out. But basically you've got money going in to guilt's yields down quite pronounced, the 17 basis point move on the 30 year, the 10 year at 417, that's a 15 basis point move. The 5's is at 414 and the 2 year, of course, at the front end, 374. So you're looking at essentially a 15 to 17 basis point move lower as money moves into guilt. So some reassurance then, and that was reflected in the panel see, of course, if this holds up to and including that statement, an 11 from the UK Chancellor, Francine. Yeah, if we dig deeper into the sectors, there's not these massive swings. I'm seeing actually quite a lot of green, but again, they're not massive gains. They're getting between 0, 3 and 1%. Auto parts, utilities gain around 1%, then you have banks and energy stocks. And then if you look a bit of pressure, but again, it's not a huge move. It's just a little bit to the downside. I have chemicals, construction materials, and consumer goods ton. OK, now, new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to make that statement, then on Britain's fiscal plans at 11 this morning. It's as, of course, Liz Truss, the Prime Minister, her position as PM is coming under increased pressure following a series of euterns on a mini budget that resulted in the sacking of her previous Chancellor and left her plans for the economy in Tatters. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden in Downey Street. Lizzy was soon in the market reaction, then, a bit of a bid for guilt, some relief for cost, reflecting the pound as well. When it comes to the Trussonomics agenda, essentially dead, what are we expecting from the new Chancellor? Well, Tom, it's absolutely no coincidence that the Chancellor, the new Chancellor has given us a heads up that he's going to be speaking today before the market open. And you can see that reflected in the guilt market already, the lift there now. We're expecting Jeremy Hunt to make even more euterns on Trussonomics. It seems to be dead in the water at this point, because she did say on Friday that she was going to eutern on corporation tax. She sacked her Chancellor quasi-quarting, hugely politically embarrassing, but it doesn't do much to balance the book's economically. Bloomberg economics says she needs to find another 24 billion pounds worth of revenue razors and saving in terms of spending cuts. So we'll get more of that today. It looks like Trussonomics is rapidly being turned into soon economics, and it leaves a wide open goal for Keir Starmer. It's leaving Tory MPs asking themselves, what's the point of having Lys Truss here at number 10? Three have already come out publicly and called for her to go. More behind the scenes are asking themselves, should we roll the dice and take a new leader now or wait for near certain wipe out in 2024? They're going to have a close eye on the guilt market today. But as George Osborne, the former UK Chancellor, put it, she is the Pino Prime Minister in name only. So Lizzy, if Lys Truss can weather the markets, of course, as you're saying, her second test is really trying to deal with the mutiny within her conservative party. Where does this live, the BOE? Well, we've just heard from the Bank of England this morning confirming what we already knew essentially, that their emergency...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3769,2022-10-17 07:09:19

15485," Some U-turns around tax and around government spending. Those will probably have some impact on how much investors are demanding in terms of risk premium to own those longer-term bonds. But then when you bring it back to the BOE policy, of course, there is still some interest rate risk. You know, we're hearing from the chancellor today, but then we also have the UK CPI on Thursday. And that is persistently high. You know, expected to come in at that 9.9%. And you know, just try of the double digit figures. So the BOE rate high risk is very much still on the table. But Kreme, at the same time, every time you see a relatively sharp interest rate rise, then you have to look at the places in the markets, which is leveraged that are fine at 1% not so fine at 5%. And this is partly what happened in the pension's market. Are there any other pockets in the markets in the UK that we should really worry about? I mean, of course, the housing market, we do have a lot of fixed rate mortgages that are rolling off to floating in 2023. A lot of analysts have been pointing to the spring 2023 point, especially because it would intersect with the peak terminal rate of the BOE. So I think, of course, the mortgage market is something that's worth monitoring. But ultimately, that policy path from the BOE is still going to remain hawkish. And we heard that from Governor Bailey in Washington just earlier. And it's going to remain hawkish so long as the persistent inflation repressures, especially at the core level, remain. Yes. From the BOE to the Fed, then, Christine, I'll bring you in at this point. Particularly on the back of that University of Michigan survey around inflation expectations over one year, and it coming in higher than expected. And we know, Jay Powell has made a point in saying he watches that survey very closely indeed. How does that change the view from the markets in terms of rate pricing around the Fed? Well, John, I think last week's figure is the University of Michigan figure, yes, but also the US CPI figure which came in higher than expected. I think that just drives on the point that the Fed itself has a lot more to do when it comes to tackling inflation. It was very interesting to see earlier in the week when there was a little bit of a new one's change in the way the Fed was communicating around this. I mean, it seemed like there was starting to recognize the global impact of their policy and kind of being mindful of that, especially in the minutes of the September meeting. But then when the data came out, I think that kind of shifted the conversation back again to the Fed's primary focus, which is getting inflation down in the US, regardless of what potential risks that may pose to the rest of the global economy. And so I think that's where we are at the moment, which again, leaves the rest of the world either scrambling to catch up with the Fed or having to deal with the painful consequences of a stronger dollar and a global economy that would be struggling as a result of that.

As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. It's a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade.

Let's bring in then Bloomberg's China government report to column Murphy, who is in Beijing for us and was in the great hall of the people for the speech column. In terms of the main takeaways, then, what really kind of stood out to you? Well, there was a whole host of different topics. So it was like from COVID to common prosperity, to building up the military, Taiwan, so on and so forth. But I do think, you know, in the immediate sort of time frame, people were really curious as to what he would say about COVID, because that seems to be the most immediate barrier to the economic development here right now. And, you know, he defended it. It's his signature policy. And he said it was good for China, that it helped protect people and the economy. And he avoided giving any timeline around changes to that strategy, which of course is becoming increasingly unpopular as people are more and more frustrated with it in terms of how it's impacting their daily lives, but also the economy. So, come, what's on the cards for the next couple of days? I mean, there's quite a lot in the speech, and, you know, on geopolitics, that makes the markets a little bit wary today. Right, there was quite a lot, as you said. And, you know, this will take the implications of which will take a while to sort of work through. But I think for this particular week, we will see the delegates meeting mainly behind closed doors, reviewing the report, reviewing topics such as corruption, and that will reemerge next week with a vote on the report and a short speech by C. But, you know, as you mentioned, the Taiwan issue particularly is quite of note with, you know, she saying that it's a Chinese issue, and which is definitely a pushback against the US. And that sort of brings in the question, where are we headed in terms of US-China relations? Will there be a C-Biden meeting and how will that go?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3772,2022-10-17 07:21:35

Watch the expectations of B for that and that would be of course coming up next month. So yeah, there's a lot to reflect on, a lot to work through and it will take some time before the actual implications of the amount of, you know, the long speech, just they will begin to take shape. Thank you so much, Colin Murphy. There are Bloomberg's China government reporter and of course our expert, our resident expert in China is also our Tommy Kensie who you've been many many years in China and one of the things that's you know not surprising but I guess that the markets are now reacting because one of the greatest unknowns is actually what happens in China economically and politically. Yeah absolutely, in particular in COVID-19 we have this drumbeat of statements within the state media saying this is a system, this is a policy that works and we're not backing down from that and you heard that reiterated from Xi Jinping. Karim, I want to bring you in at this point for your views. Does any of this change Black Rock's views on the investibility of China? Not really, I mean when we look at China I think we need to break it up into the tactical horizon and the strategic on the tactical horizon you're absolutely right, it's all about the zero COVID policy and any signs of easing as the congress finishes and we didn't get a lot of signs of that and so I think this will be really important for activity data. We have a lot of activity data coming out this week from industrial production to retail sales to GDP which will give us a sense of how much the zero COVID strategy to date has been impacting and whether there's been any signs of easing up in the impact on activity and that will be key for the tactical view on China. But what does that mean in terms of regulation? So we're expecting them to inject for example things to encourage listed companies for example to buy back shares. Does this support the world economy at the margins because you see a boost in China or is it really just domestic policy? I would say it's more domestic actually this has been one of the big factors when looking at the global economy and also some of the downgrades that we've seen from the IMF and the global economic growth forecast which is basically that this time China is not the source of growth that usually shows up the global economy when you have shocks and other parts of the world. This time around we're not seeing that pull through which is creating more risks for the global economy as we head into 2023. I want to quickly get your views on earnings which is another big topic for us this week. We had some of the bank earnings coming through on Friday, JP Morgan City, Morgan Stanley. Do you think that earnings peaked in the second quarter? You hold that view. What are you saying? What are you looking for and why are you seeing margins being maintained? Yeah, I mean we do see them as having peaked and also when I look at the earning analyst estimates they're still too high. They've come down. They've come down more in the US than they have in Europe interestingly which means that even though Europe is cheaper in terms of how much it's underperformed you could still see more pain in Europe as the analyst estimates get surprised on the downside more whereas even in the US earnings are still too positive. So they've peaked and the analysts have not reflected that they have peaked in terms of where to see some signs of strength. I mean I would look at it on a sector level and I would focus on those pockets of the stock market where we have a bit more resilience to this margin pressure theme. So I'd stay away from the consumers even the consumers staples which are traditionally defensive even those are finding it more difficult to pass the cost to consumer or to shore it up. So I would stick with the healthcare and other types of defensive. Correct. Thank you so much. Currie Bechette. They're head of investment strategy for I shares at the MAA at BlackRock.

15489," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING McC indemnat... My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investable universe you look at the private markets and it's you know significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors and I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. Welcome back to the open everyone 30 minutes into the European trading den here are your top stories, stories, downing street hot seat UK bonds surge at the open on expectations of more U-turns by the government. Now the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is sent to make a fiscal statement at 11 a.m. London time. Taking a stand China's president Xi backs COVID-0 at his party congress and doubles down on policies and the center of tensions with the US Chinese stocks slide. Plus the EU plans to temporarily overhaul the continent's gas market with the dynamic price cap its latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills. So Tommy if you look at the markets are kind of trading sideways but actually quite a lot going on in UK UK bonds surging corporate bonds seem to be really mirroring what we're seeing in guilt. And we know that that corporate stress has been that has been very very acute indeed. Any relief will be welcome certainly for the corporate space it is earning season as well so we continue to watch the numbers that come through but absolutely the focus is on the UK guilt markets this morning after what was an attempted charm offensive by the new chancellor over the weekend with the media and of course his message to the markets around stability and getting the fiscal house back in order more unpicking of trust economics is expected that statement out at 11 a.m. will be of course zeroed in on by not just politicians and political watches but also of course the markets.

15490," tax essentially unchanged in Germany. And here in the UK, the FTSE 100, adding 12 points up to 10th of a percent. Let's switch to the over, have a look at the sectors as we continue to keep in mind that really, it's what's happening in the guilt markets this morning when it comes to the UK. That is the most important. You have seen that move of money into guilt's yields off by around 20 basis points the last time I check. So let's have a look at the sectors then. Again, I talked about the earnings season. Stateside on Friday had JP Morgan and City coming through with better than expect results from Morgan Stanley, a bit of a disappointment. And then Goldman Sachs, the interest around the restructuring that is emerging there within that investment bank as well. Utilities that are the list followed by energy and telecom. So a bit of a safe haven tilt in terms of the way that money flowing into these equities in these sectors this morning. The bottled on the list consume a products down 9% percent technology, also low by 7% worth noting. And as that fell and closed, lower by more than 3%. The S&P lower by about 2.5% on Friday. The University of Michigan survey just reconfirming that inflation is persistent and the Fed is going to have to do more to get that under control. But let's go from the Fed to the Bank of England and the Central Bank here has confirmed it will terminate its emergency bond buying program. That as the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is due to make a statement on Britain's fiscal plans at 11 this morning. For more, we are joined by Bloomberg's Lizzie Brayden, Lizzie breakdown then, the B.O.E. statement that we had out. They confirmed that they did indeed wrap up that bond buying on Friday. They did, but this is a statement that's intended to calm markets while they have wrapped up bond buying. They're also saying that there are various or the repo facilities available if needed. And so the broader message is that the Bank of England now wants to refocus on fighting inflation, but it's there if necessary. This was the message that Andrew Bailey was trying to hammer home at the IMF over the weekend. He did actually say that he expects higher, a bigger rate rise is going to be needed in November than was expected in August as a result of Liz Truss' fiscal policy. But interestingly, looking at B.O.E. market pricing this morning, it's actually at its lowest since the mini budget. And now the key rates peak in May is expected at 5.36%. So a calming in markets has changed the course a little bit for the B.O.E. it seems. So it all seems that Lizzie and I can't say that it seems Lizzie and I could watch actually you all day in front of Downing Street. Is it people coming in and out? You wonder what they must be thinking and saying. And I know you've lost a spot at Larry the cat last Friday. So if the chancellor is in charge and if it's basically Jeremy Hunt that calls the shots now, what are we expecting him to say? Well, we're expecting lots more reversals on Trussonomics as Jeremy Hunt turns Trussonomics into soon-acconomics and calms the markets. He finally, we have a good communicator in number 11 Downing Street. He hinted at his message over the weekend. And then this morning pre-announced that we're going to hear from him at 11 o'clock and 3.30 today. And then as a result, you've seen guilt s rallying. So no coincidence there. But what we're expecting in terms of the reversals, a confirmation that this cut in income tax will be delayed. We're expecting reversals on the cuts in stamp duty, the tax in dividends, tax free shopping for overseas visitors. So dismantling quasi-quartengues plans one by one. But the irony is that these were also Liz Truss' plans. So it seems that Trussonomics is dead in the water, which begs the question, what is the point of having her here at number 10 Downing Street? Tory MPs are asking themselves three publicly have called on her to go. Behind the scenes more are asking whether she's got days, weeks, or months left. Quasi-quarteng actually has said that it's only a week. All right, Lizzie, thanks so much. Lizzie Birdon there outside number 10. Now Goldman Sachs plans to combine this flagship investment banking and trading businesses into a unit as part of the organization, a free organization. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. Now this makes David Solman's third major restructure in just four years as chief executive now joining us with Morris Tom Metcalfe, who've leans our finance team here in London. So first of all, Tom, good morning. How dramatic is this? And does it mean that the last reorganization didn't work? Or is it just improving on what he's already built? Yeah, I think it's probably the former. So for me, the thing that jumps out here is the optics. This is the third.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3776,2022-10-17 07:39:39
15491," I think that the last reorganization didn't work, or is it just improving on what he's already built? Yeah, I think it's probably the former. So for me, the thing that jumps out here is the optics. This is the third sort of real gun four years. That is not a good look for any CEO. And it's a lot of these sort of flagship programs that you know, we launched a lot of fanfare. Hey, this is going to be the way we sort of move Goldman Sachs to the future. And guess what, they're sort of rolling them back, but also at the same time kind of restructuring the firm. It's on me, I'm very diplomatic, but you kind of nod to this. So what does it mean for the credibility of David Solomon? What does it mean for his standing within the bank and within the banking world and for his strategy? Yeah, I think it's bad news for all of them, right? You never want to be so really completely reverse-course as we can see in the UK, right? But I think particularly sort of embarrassing almost is this smooth back from Marcus. So that was launched, he kind of staked his name on it. So this is the way we're going to get regular recurrent revenue. And guess what, they're now basically breaking that up in terms of splitting out among various banks. It's now definitely not a sort of top priority. So will we have a clue in through quarter earnings on whether this is because they didn't do as well as expected? Yeah, I suspect you must see some losses, right? That's normally what's going to be pushing something like that through. So if earnings come out tomorrow, I think this is all meant to be announced then. So they've been kind of hurried into these sort of revelations. And it'll be interesting to see how he characterises David Solomon. OK, so they added interest around the earnings. Tom, what else are you looking for? And what have you learnt from the earnings? They came through from J.P. Morgan's city, Morgan's standing, a bit of a disappointment there. Where do you think Stan in terms of the banking earnings up until this point? Yeah, I think when we're looking at Goldman, we're going to obviously look at their trade numbers. I think it's pretty obvious the investment bank inside is going to struggle like all the other banks. And it's just a question how much can the traders sort of cover those kind of shortfalls? So I think for a few of the banks you did see that happen. But yeah, someone like Morgan Stanley was a bit disappointed for the markets. OK, Bloomberg's Tom Meckoff on the travails over at Goldman. Another re-structured looking head to those earnings. They'll be added interest really tomorrow around Goldman. Thanks, Tom Meckoff. Thank you. As ever, friends. Now, coming up, the Paris Motor Show is back. We'll be hearing from Mr. Lanter's chief executive, Carlos Tavarez. He's coming up next with our caroline conan. This is Bloomberg. Now, I'm so excited for what I'd seen today. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys and that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating Love again. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that.

15492," Please tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Welcome back to the Open 40 minutes into European Training Day. I can tell you about European stocks. They are currently flat. The interest though really lies in what's happening in the guild markets here in the UK. And you aren't seeing yields lower quite significantly. These are bid now. This is going to offer some relief, some respite, at least temporarily, for the new chancellor of the ex-Jekker Jeremy Hunt ahead of that statement at 11 a.m. UK time. So at the front end, that is a 23 basis point move lower. At the 30 year, which was getting close to that 5% level again towards the end of last week. It's currently at 4.5 on the 30 year. That is a move lower by 27 basis points. The pound also up 8.10%. And the futures in the US pointed to gain is between 8.10 and 9.10 of 8%. Let's get the Bloomberg first word news now with Alice. Hi Tom. In the UK, the pound is gaining this morning. That's on expectations. There may be further U turns over the government's unfunded tax cuts. The newly appointed chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, told the BBC that nothing is off the table. I'm not taking anything off the table. I want to keep as many of those tax cuts as I possibly can because our long term health depends on being a low tax economy. And I very strongly believe that. Goldman Sachs is downgrading its outlook for growth in the UK. That's after Prime Minister Liz Truss replaced her chancellor and road back on canceling an increase in the UK. The bank says it now expects a more significant recession. Annual growth for 2023 is now minus 1% down from minus 0.4%. Chinese President Xi Jinping says China is staying the course as it faces what he calls dangerous storms and growing challenges from the US. In an almost two hour speech to open the five year-lead Communist Party Congress, she said China would pursue development while ensuring national security. He also said Taiwan reunification was a matter for the Chinese and hailed what he called the restoration of order in Hong Kong. Global news, 20 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take power by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Tom Francine. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I'll ask that, Kim's in London. The Mercedes-Benz Chief Executive says the energy crisis may be a challenge in Europe for the next two to three years, but this could also be a catalyst to accelerate the transition into renewables. Mercedes won't have a stand at the Paris Car Show but has unveiled a new electric SUV. The Chief Executive, Ola Kalinyos, spoke with Bloomberg's Carolyn Conan. The last few years has been a challenging business environment with COVID, with supply restrictions and of course also the war in Ukraine derives energy prices. If you couple that with interest rates, you know, the economy might cool down, but we've always had these cycles and we have gone through the cycles. If you have a resilient brand like Mercedes-Benz with a very loyal customer base, I think we're going to be prepared for whatever may come. Your third quarter sales were quite strong. Do you expect some kind of moderation in the fourth quarter? We grew by 21% in the third quarter, so we're very happy about that. Very robust and we're also looking at finishing this year off in a robust fashion. Do the Chinese car makers, especially those making EVs, pose a threat to you? China is the biggest car market in the world, so naturally you will have international brands in China. Like us, it's our biggest and most successful market in the last 10 years. But isn't it naturally in competition that maybe some of those brands are going to try to seek their luck in the European market as well? I think that's all fine. Another challenge, of course, of the kind industry has been the supply chain challenge. What car parts are you missing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3778,2022-10-17 07:47:48
15493," European market as well. I think that's all fine. Another challenge, of course, of the kind industry has been the supply chain challenge. What carpods are you missing at the moment? Primarily for the last couple of years or even more, we have been looking at shortages of semiconductors, different kinds of semiconductors. And the chip makers and also the wafer fabs are increasing their production capacities. But that takes time. There's a lead time to build up that. So I think this supply chain constraint will certainly be with us throughout this year and also into next year. And then hopefully as we go through next year step by step we will see a better situation. We have the energy crisis. Some also worry that it may have an impact on steel makers. Are you worried you might be missing steel at some point? I think we have to divide this into maybe two phases. Yes, Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany. It has been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short to midterm challenge. But if we go a little bit longer, mid to long term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. In fact, we have made two very big decisions only in the last couple of months. We're going to build a sizable wind park on one of our premises in north of Germany. And also signed up just recently with an energy company here in Europe, a massive wind park in the Baltic Sea. Those two projects alone in the mid to long term will cover 40% of our electricity needs. So you can see now that companies are making decisions to create resilience in the mid to long term. Okay, the Mercedes CEO speaking to our Caroline Conner who joins us now with another fantastic interview, the CEO of Stellantis, Caroline. Tom, we haven't had a Paris car show in four years, the last one was in 2018. And I know with the Stellantis CEO Carlos Stavarez, in front of a Jeep Avenger, fully electric, Stellantis wants to be one of the leaders of electrification in Europe. My first question to you would be how you planning to do that, even the very fierce competition? Well, look at the numbers, look at the numbers here in France. The Le Mans EV cells is the Peugeot 208, electric. Look at the fantastic Jeep Avenger, the first pure EV Jeep that we introduce in Europe. And we are fighting for the number one spot in terms of pure EV cells in Europe. And with our PHEV plus the BV in this country, we are by far the leaders. So look at the numbers. A lot of brands are actually not coming to this Paris car show. Volkswagen is not here, BMW is not here. However, a lot of Chinese EV makers, including BYD and GreatVol are here this year at the Paris car show, isn't that risky to open this kind of highway to Chinese EV makers? Perhaps it is, but I would say it's marginal. If you compare to the framing that was offered by the European Union to the Chinese competition, if you look at what has been set in terms of open markets, regulations that support what has been done in the Chinese market for the last 10 or 15 years, the risk is there. The fact that we are here or not, we are here, we stand on this, are at the Paris Motor Show. Some of my competitors decided not to come. As I did, I didn't go to the Munich Motor Show a few months ago. That's a pure return on investment decision, but the big, the bigger real estate. The big fact is that European Union has opened the market to the Chinese competitors in a way that indeed we can challenge. One of the big challenges of course of the car industry has been the supply chain challenge including chips. Are you ready to pay more for chips? So they don't go to competitors like Tesla? Well actually we are already paying more for the chips. All the industry is paying more for the chips because as you know, the real competitor of the automotive industry when you look for chips is the consumer electronic industry. So the automotive industry is already paying more for the chips.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3779,2022-10-17 07:52:09
15494," The real competitor of the automotive industry when you look for ships is the consumer electronic industry. So the automotive industry is already paying more for the ships and of course that's bad news for the consumer because at the end of the day when we protect the sustainability of our companies that the additional cost ends up in the price of the cost. So it's bad news for the consumers but yes the answer is yes because we are competing with the consumer electronics industry. Apart from chips, what car parts are you missing at the moment? Are you worried for example that the energy crisis that's cutting a lot of pressure on steel makers will actually make it hard to find steel in the future? I would say that the situation is uneven. On the ships and the semiconductor front things are improving progressively, slowly but progressively and I can guesstimate that by the end of 2023. That situation will be vanished and that will be a balance between the demand and the manufacturing needs. So that situation is improving. On the steel front I think that the steel makers are doing whatever they can to keep the pressure on the market so that they limit the capacity so that prices remain quite high. But as we know we see that the economic slowdown is now bringing the demand down and as the demand is going to go down the price of steel will have to go down and is already giving signs that it goes down. So that is not now the major factor. What I was visible is the logistics. The logistics in Europe and namely the road logistics are a big big problem in this region of the world. And this is now the bottleneck of the industry is the speed at which you bring the cars to the consumers and to the dealerships. That's where the bottleneck is right now. Finally the energy crisis is also of course having an impact on consumers. The ACA association is still expecting the car market to shrink compared to pre-COVID levels. Do you think the cost of living crisis, the energy crisis is having an impact? How long do you think this is going to last for European car customers? That's the key question you are raising. I believe that the European Union and the political leaders should recognize that for a modern democracy freedom of mobility is a pillar of modern democracies. And that means that we need to protect the affordability for the middle classes to access clean safe automobiles. This is fundamental. And of course the energy inflation is not helping the access to the automobile and the freedom of mobility of the middle classes. That needs to be handled. But it also assumes that the European Union will be able to move beyond dogmatism. And many decisions that have been made over the last few years are purely dogmatic. And now it's time to start being pragmatic. So what I would recommend to the European political leaders is that they add a layer of pragmatism to the dogmatism that led to the decisions they have made, led to the situation we know today. And please recognize that we have been explaining for the last five years that this will be the consequence of the decision. So the industry has been anticipating on those consequences. How long will the energy crisis impact the European consumer? This is the key question according to the Stellanticio Carlos Tavares, back to you in London. Thank you very much indeed with the Stellantis CEO there at the auto show. Coming up Jim O'Neill, former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, of course, and former UK government minister joining at the top of the hour, do not miss that conversation. This is Bloomberg. Thank you very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3780,2022-10-17 07:55:59
15495," how they could go through the supposed normal process of a three month, two to three month plan of electing a new election from at the end of the day, what is basically 150,000 people. And I can't imagine many Tory MPs would want to have an immediate general election given the opinion polls. So if you rule out both of those options, the only other one is a so-called coronation. And because there are so many factions inside the Tory party, I can't see the candidate that would be likely to be anointed by so many. So as bizarre and as crazy as it is, but as your colleague Lizzie just described, effectively the PM trots on some kind of version of a chair, not a particularly strong one. And the chance was now the CEO, but all of that could unravel if he himself now has made the error of raising expectations and can't deliver. And the biggest problem of them all is you have a party that is obviously ideologically committed to lower taxes. But you have a country that does not want significant spending cuts. And if you can't marry those two, how can you have fiscal credibility? And he's said all the right things have been really impressed with what Jeremy said over the weekend. But how can you marry those three things together without really, really soft decisions that are going to upset a significant number of people? So what's the plan you imagine coming out from the chancellor today? I mean, I don't think he will be able to really detail any spending cuts because of course, linked to aspects of what I've said with the factions, he can't just impose those on all the different departments or many of those cabinet ministers themselves will be part of a revolt against him. So he can only give a flavor of what it likes to do on spending cuts. And then I, if I was I know, he will spend the week sitting down with all of them trying to persuade them to what, and it's for what I can see over the weekend, virtually every department is going to have to have some kind of cuts. So therefore, what he will do today is tell us now what the markets have effectively priced in and what again Lizzie talks about. They're going to reverse all the tax moves bar the National Insurance Coop. But we kind of know that now that the tricky bit is unless they're actually going to raise income tax or bringing some other higher taxes, which he could do. And some part of me thinks at least from a policy ideal, that would be what they should do. I think he won't go that far this quickly because he wants to explore the limits of standing cuts. So what do you think international investors, Jim, are thinking right now is a UK still investible, maybe more investible than a week ago or in the truth. Now, I think the job is still out because we don't know how stronger cards the new chance was being given. It looks from how he's behaved over the weekend that he feels as though he's got a really strong card. But when it comes to trying to push through spending cuts, he's got two problem. I've talked about one. He's got problems with the with each department and the secretary of state. But you then got going to open up all the issues around it. Let's call it the left wing of the Tory party with one nation toy as they call themselves and others that understand there is a need for government supports to help particularly health but other leveling up something I'm obviously hugely involved in the Northern powerhouse. All of those things are fraught with practical and political difficulties. So I don't think investors will be suddenly become really excited about the UK. That's for sure. I don't think there'll be as freaked out as they were on Friday, but that could change before the days out if Jeremy makes any mistakes to them. Jim, what do you think? You know, I don't know whether you saw it as a Bailey versus trust kind of game of chicken.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3841,2022-10-17 08:11:13
15496," If Jeremy makes any mistakes to them? Jim, what do you think? You know, I don't know whether you saw it as a Bailey versus Truss kind of game of chicken last week. And whether this is one zero to Governor Bailey and what the Bank of England can do next. Listen, I think, you know, Andrew Bailey came in for a lot of criticism from all over the place at the past fortnight. And as you know, we've discussed it before. I think the bank has made mistakes in terms of monetary policy in the buildup to all of this in recent months. They should have tightened faster and more. But I'm broadly supportive of what the bank has tried to do here in a spectacularly difficult position. And it's definitely one-mill. It's probably more than one-mill to the bank. I think the bank has handled the past four weeks and particularly the past week pretty well. They're obviously going to be watching all of this just as closely as the markets. And another sort of rinky-dink complication for the pound is of course, if what the Chancellor goes ahead with and gives impression of today is really credible, then all ideas of the bank raising by one percent will probably go out of the window too. So it'll be better for the guilt market, but the pound itself will lose any potential support from the scale of interest rate hikes that people have been talking about. So all of it is interrelated and obviously pretty tricky stuff to walk through. Yeah, pretty tricky. We'll talk also a little bit about leverage shortly. And Jim, there's like, Manu versus Chelsea. You know, I think I'm going to ask you about that. It's like the O'Neill versus Laquois square off this Saturday. So we will talk football as well. We'll have more with the Jim O'Neill shortly. This is Bloomberg. Music What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close?

Now, UK bonds are served at the open on expectations of more new terms on the government's plans to cut taxes and increase borrowing. The new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, at the UK's fourth in as many months, is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3842,2022-10-17 08:15:26
15497," The search said the open expectations of more U-turns on the government's plans to cut taxes and increase borrowing. The U-Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, at the U-K, the U-K's fourth in as many months is said to make a fiscal statement at 11 a.m. London time. Well, or Jim O'Neill is still with us. Jim, we're talking a bit before about the pitfalls and some of the uncertainty, of course, going on to also that inflation report from the U-K on Wednesday. What do you do with housing right now? I know we're looking at leverage and I guess the pension market was a stark reminder that you can make money or get on if interest rates are at 1%, but we need to maybe look at the parts of the market where it doesn't work at 5%. So listen, I think, linked how I answered the last question before the break, I think there are clearly some on the MPC that are already worried about how much financial conditions have tightened and given the amounts of leverage effectively with our consumers, they have understandable concerns that if the raise rates too aggressively too quickly, it's just going to add to the scale of pain to our consumers and deepen the recession whilst that might superficially help the fight against inflation, it might be too much. So, all of that's got its own tricky part. A separate part of my brain is can't stop thinking this morning about, you know, this never ending thing that one gets through periods of big tightening of monetary policy, where you suddenly find all these pockets of hidden leverage all over the place. And what's going on in the UK here is a sort of forward, if you make a parallel God forbid that it ends up being the same with O7 and O8, you know, before the complete collapse of everything in O8, as you will remember, we had a few things that started 12 months earlier in the summer of O7 and in some ways that, and I think that's going on in markets too, it's making many, many people think, well, what other pockets of excessive leverage are though in country X, Y and Z. And all of this will remain an issue obviously as the Fed being forced by the data has to keep on tightening as aggressively as it's doing. So it's all very troubling and haven't even focused on the fact that I had lunch with somebody late last week. Like this month, we have some really important CPI days that are coming out of Japan because we're getting closer to the point where the B.O.J. is going to have to abandon yield curve management there and goodness me, when that goes after, what is it, the best part of 20 years of QE in Japan? You know, there could be endless, endless fallout from all of that. Going back to those parts of the markets which are too leveraged, is this shadow banking? And what is the chance that something that we're not seeing now unravels to the extent that we get a financial crisis like in O8? I mean, this is another hope. I don't know, Fran, I really don't know. There's three things going on in my mind. First of all, the regulates always do a pretty good job at putting in place, stopping a piece of exactly what happened in the past crisis. So in that regard, it does look, secondly, as though the big banks are pretty well capitalized for virtually anything. However, there is no such as a free lunch, a thing as a free lunch. And as we get from ridiculously low rates that seemingly we're going on forever, but it's something vaguely like normality. The system has got a coat with all the ways of savings and the boring needs of being met, which essentially must mean a lot of the so-called shadow banking systems. So within the so-called real money community, we've seen it here in the UK with the GIL issue in the past month. There must be quite a few of those in different parts of the global savings pool, I would guess. How much do you worry about the housing market? Could we really see a crash in the UK? I mean, if you just look at what's happened the past fortnight and hear people, the housing market essentially shoots. And I was listening to some stories over the weekend about from the individual real estate agents.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3843,2022-10-17 08:19:54
15498," The housing market has essentially shut. I was listening to some stories over the weekend about from the individual real estate agents and that the number of visits and people planning to go through with houses already visited have just dropped off a cliff. So unless the Chancellor's policies and his style succeed in calming down the guilt market, we already have got a reversal of the UK's housing market in underway. Hopefully it won't turn into a complete collapse. But that obviously is from what I can see now completely dependent on the credibility of the government's fiscal policy. Jim, what are you buying menu? And I'm sad we're not... So I'm going to the Chelsea game on Saturday and you're not going to be there. So we can't even like, you know, have a bet on who wins. There you go. Listen, from what I can tell, despite everything, the owners or the two or the six siblings that really control what will happen to mention I said, for whatever reason don't want to sell. They seem to still think either at some magical moment, some lunatic somewhere is going to pay the mediotic money. And in the meanwhile they carry on treating it as this huge cash car for them. And do they really care how you know how to do, so long as it's in the news every day and they can do advertising deals, sadly they don't seem to care. All right, Jim, I'm still betting on you buying it at some point. I don't know how you get a consortium together, but I'll continue trying to fly the flag. Let me know when you figure it out, fun. Yeah, well, we'll crowdfund it. Jim, thank you. As always, Lerge and O'Neill there, of course, on everything UK and of course a bit of football. Coming up the EU has a plan to rein in the block's energy crisis involving its biggest gas marketplace. We have the draft details. This is Bluebird. A digital first approach to the future of work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. But the future of work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. If I can have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey.

Plus, the EU plans to temporarily overhaul the confidence gas market with the dynamic price cap its latest effort to rein in soaring energy bills. Good morning, everyone and welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Franci Lacwag here in London. Now President Xi Jinping delivered a defined message to the world and a speech at the Communist Party Congress that China is ready to stand its ground. She also signaled no change in direction for two main risk factors dragging the economy down, strict COVID rules and housing market policies. It's bringing Bloomberg's Jean-Lou in Beijing who heads all of our Chinese coverage. So what are the main key takeaways from that speech? So I'll give you three key takeaways, Franci. One on COVID-0, as you said, President Xi talked about how the policy had done good things for China. There was no indication of a change in direction on the horizon. And so we expect COVID-0 to continue that being said there was not as full-throded defense of the policy as some thought there might be. So I think the door remains slightly open for some change down the road, but we'll have to wait and see. On the economy, President Xi again confirmed to reaffirm that economic growth was the Communist Party's top priority. There have been some speculation that he might drop that line from his speech, which has been there for many decades at every party Congress. And finally, I would say on the diplomacy front, President Xi striking at the finance stance, talking about how all the ways that China has...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3846,2022-10-17 08:33:00
15501," President Xi striking at the finance stance, talking about how all the ways that China has run its economy, run its diplomacy, done various things, have worked, have been an alternative method, methodology, model for the world for other countries to follow. So setting up a very competitive meeting with President Biden at the G20 next month. So, John, what's in the cards for the next couple of days? So, in the next couple of days we will have briefings from the Congress. We had one this morning about the economy, about the state of the energy supply for China. There will be one later, for example, on diplomacy. We don't have the exact date for where some of these briefings yet. The big event, though, will be this weekend. The Congress concludes on Saturday, the 22nd, and then it'll be on Sunday about new time here in Beijing. We will get the new Standing Committee lineup. That will be the seven people who will run this country for the next five years. All right, John. As always, thank you so much for joining us. John Lue, there in charge of all of our Beijing coverage. Now, we're also joined by Stefan Ost, author of Xi Jinping, the most powerful man in the world, and former editor of Derch Peege. Stefan, thank you so much for joining us. A lot of questions about how China will be different after this people's Congress. What did you hear yesterday that could change the trajectory? Well, actually, I think the opening of the party Congress showed very clear the direction in which it will go. It was all around the person of Xi Jinping, now doubt that at the end of the Congress, he will be declared leader for another term. And then he will be the only Chinese leader after Mao Zitong for more than 10 years, and Mao was the leader of a poor developing country, while Xi is leader of an economic superpower. That makes the biggest difference. And I think he is going to try at least to be the leader for his whole lifetime. But, Stefan, what does it mean? We know, for example, that the Chinese president gave very little assurance on China's economic risks, right, that those will ease, because there's no change in direction for some of the things that he's put in place. Where does that leave China going forward? Well, actually, we don't really know. When we wrote the book, we were talking about and writing about his past, and trying to tell the story of China along his lifetime, and his lifeline along the story of China. So we don't really know what will happen. But the interesting thing is that in a certain way, the economy of China is not a communist economy anymore. That has changed. It's a market economy. It's a capitalist economy. But at the same time, it's a one-party system. It's a one-party dictatorship. And now one single person will be on the top, at least for the last, I don't know, years along he will live. And the interesting thing is, if you have two power structures, at the same time, an economic power structure with rich people, careers, people who make careers, connection for the foreign countries, for the global economic system, you need, if you look at from that point of view, you need a very strong, yeah, let's say, what it is, dictatorship to keep the business man and the business in this socialist way. And what he invented is kind of trying to fight corruption, and he decides who is corrupt and who is not. But so what does that mean, actually, for how the U.S. should deal with China? I know some of the questions, for example, is the market is trying to figure out when they talk about technology, and is that an indication of whether they will support the sector, and of course, that would be, you know, against what the U.S. has been trying to do? Well, actually, the main reason for China's growth, the economic growth, and the growth of its power, its world power, is opening the borders. And first, they were the working bench of the West, and she is trying to change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3847,2022-10-17 08:37:21
15502," is opening the borders. And first they were the working bench of the West. And Qi is trying to change that to concentrate more on China's own market. And at the same time, the national growth product is getting as big as the American one. So the Americans really are a little... Yeah, not really a little. They are afraid that the Chinese will take them over. So not as a country, but be more wealthy and bigger than the American economy is. Which is not a secret if you have 1.4 billion people living there compared to Americans four times as many. But at the same time, the Americans try to keep it a little bit away from China and don't deliver everything that they need to China and not buying everything. Do you see Stefan, the anxiousness or the world being split into two, the pro-US and the pro-Russia? And it's unclear where China falls into all of this. And actually, I think this is a big danger these days that we come back into a situation like during the Cold World War, the Cold War when you had one socialist communist part in the world and the capitalist party at the same time and always the danger of a big conflict. So I hope it won't go into that direction. But the danger is rather big because the relationship between the Chinese and the Russians were quite close during the time of the Cold World War, but right now, it's getting as close as it used to be at that time with one main difference. China is much, much stronger than it was during that time and what they need is energy and there is one country in the world who has energy on mass that is Russia. And so what does the US do with this now? What's the right approach? Actually, I wouldn't like or try to give them some advice, but I think it would be good not to let the confrontation go as far as it used to be during the Cold War time. I think we have to be in a world economy and I think we have to make business with countries who are not on our democratic level. Otherwise, it will get very cold for us. Thank you so much for joining us. Stefan Osler, author of Xi Jinping, the most powerful man in the world, and former editor of DashpGil. Coming up, Goldman Sachs sees its third major restructuring through the Chief Executive David Solomon. That's according to the Wall Street Journal. We'll get more of that next. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to nexzero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3848,2022-10-17 08:41:25
15503," Great for a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years, as soon as the 2030s. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in a scene at... Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Economics, finance, politics. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of Francine Lacqua here in London. Now, Goldman Sachs plans to combine its flagship investment banking and trading businesses into one unit as part of a reorganization of the Wall Street Journal reports. Now, this makes David Solomon's third major restructure in just four years as Chief Executive. Now, for more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. Charlie, first of all, good morning. I mean, this feels really dramatic because it doesn't look good on paper that they've had so many. Is it to build on what they had or change things around? This is really difficult. So this is one of the biggest shakeups that the Wall Street firm has had in its history. And it's really notable. I think one of the most dramatic elements here is actually about consumer banking. Now, Bloomberg, Star, Shredar, Natarajan has been reporting on this for a long time, that Goldman wants to backtrack from its consumer banking because mainstream has been a lot more difficult to crack than Wall Street. And we're seeing that effectively being disbanded and then a simplification at Goldman, investment banking and trading in one unit, asset management and wealth in another, and then a sort of catch-all of transactions and tech. So it's a lot more simple than I think a lot of people were expecting. So what does it mean for the chief executive strategy? I don't know whether it points to the fact that they're in trouble or we're also getting earnings tomorrow. So David Solomon, the CEO, Moonlight's as a DJ. And I think any DJ will be reminded by that kind of record-spinning sound. And this is effectively another remix. Now what he has really been trying to do is look for fees in any environment because Goldman, of course, is the epitome of the Wall Street bank. But at a time when there's so much volatility, when it's harder to get those fees, it really needs a new strategy. So what are you looking for in the earnings? Right, so those earnings are on Tuesday. Yeah. And they're a tough act to follow because J.P. Morgan actually had some better than expected metrics come out. We saw net interest income for J.P. Morgan highest ever in a quarter. We're not necessarily expecting to see that for Goldman given its strategy. I mean, investment banking fees down 54% compared to last year. So I think it's going to be a struggle. One potential bright spot could be in fixed income, but that's just one spot. All right, Charlie, thanks so much. We have to exchange this is what happens. He comes on here. We talk a little bit about banking and then we also talk a little bit about recipes, including a terminal recipe. So we'll put that out on social media. Yes, do that. For people that want to know a bit of both that Charlie Wells are the very latest on Goldman Sachs. Now let's get straight to your Bloomberg business flash here is Lee and Garence. Hi, Lee and Hi, Francine. Goldman Sachs is downgrading its outlook for growth in the UK that is after Prime Minister Liz Trost replaced her Chancellor and rode back on canceling an increase in corporation tax. The bank says it now expects a more significant recession and you'll grow for 2023 is now minus 1% down from minus 0.4%. Rubit Murdoch wants to combine news, Corp and Fox, recreating the media giant he split apart nine years ago. The move would likely consolidate power in the hands of his son, Locklin, currently the CEO of Fox. So far none of the Murdoch clan have spoken publicly about the steel, but the companies acknowledged it was in the works and that was on Friday. Mercedes is broadening its battery powered lineup with a new sports utility vehicle. The aim is to take on Tesla's model wide, the carmaker's latest step to go all electric by the end of the decade.

15504," To take on Tesla's model-wide, the carmaker's latest step-to-go-all electric by the end of the decade, the EQE SUV is a fourth model to use Mercedes-Dedicated EV platform. And we spoke with the CEO who says the energy crisis may hasten the move into renewables. Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany, that's been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short-to-midterm challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer, mid to long-term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. And that's your Bloomberg business flash in France. Well yeah, thank you so much, Julian Gernes, the very latest. Now we're also getting a China delaying its third quarter GDP data release. It's giving no new schedule. Of course, we're just at the beginning of that people's party congress. We had a terrific briefing from our John Luar Beijing bureau chief and we'll continue following that very closely. And as soon as we have a time and a date for GDP third quarter in China, we'll of course bring you that live. Now European natural gas prices have fallen to a three-month low on expectations of more measures from the EU to curb volatility. Now Bloomberg has draft document of the European Commission's plan to put a dynamic price cap on the EU's biggest gas exchange. Now it's part of a range of measures to tackle the energy crisis. I'm delighted to be joined by Maria Tadeo, who joins us from London. Maria, welcome to the studio. I'm so happy to see you. I love the idea of the dynamic price cap. So what does it do on the tin? Well, what it means it's unclear, but Francine, the market likes it. I mean, you referred to it the big moves down today on the gas futures. Now this dynamic idea, in fact, it's not new. It was floated two weeks ago by the Italians. You know, they're very dynamic themselves and a lot of things. So, and what it does is that, look, it combines two things. It's full cap and then the countries that do not want to see a cap. So in between, you need with a dynamic price cap. What it means is that there is a level of free buy and sell in this market in the DTF. But once you get past a certain point or a certain level of volatility, you cap it as I can stock. So you say, well, trading stops and then beyond that, the transaction is closed. Now that's what it means. But in reality, the big question, and this is what I asked my source, today, what is the price swing that you would allow and what is the price that you would say we stop it here? And he said, well, that's according the debate. And there is no agreement on that. So fundamentally an idea, but the actual price that matters. I think that is stupid. You've seen this going to be very thorny. Yeah, it just feel like so European. I shouldn't say that. So I think I'll also believe in European things. So usually, you know, cut it to the wire and then something happens. And then do we know about implementation? Well, the implementation will have to figure out because that, well, the timeline this week is that tomorrow we get the head of the commission who by the way gave herself a deadline of October 20th, 21st to come up with big intervention. It's not just the cap. It's also the idea, perhaps, of storage for next year. How to buy things jointly. So really use the EU 27 market to get a better price, which frankly seems like a no brainer at this point. And that, of course, is down to European leaders Thursday Friday. I've been told we know it starts on Thursday. What time it ends? I don't know, but Francine, the Thursday night we're back in the four hour sleep. Four hours if you're lucky. Look at it Friday, you're lucky. Yeah, don't you get like two and a half? This is like a Maria today. Maria, I don't need to sleep today. Maria, when you look at actually the at the moment and we're seeing some pretty heavy strikes and keep this morning by drones, at the moment it seems that Europe is holding together or at least are more or less on the same page. How difficult is that going to be as we get them to the winter months? Yes, it is. And Francine, by the way, we heard because this is a very serious, of course, issue. We've seen the pictures out of Ukraine this morning. The top European diplomat, Joseb Burrell, came out and said, we need to really find out and figure out whether Iran is doing this because if they are, then that means more sanctions are potentially coming. And by the way, there's already sanctions that are being debated because of this crackdown Burrell on the women of Iran, which is, well, we've seen the pictures are really as heartbreaking in so many different ways. I think in terms of the unity, so far, they have agreed on everything unanimously, but it will depend on this winter, the bills, the social pressure. They're very aware that social backlash, of course, could really change the narrative of we're in with Ukraine for the long haul. Maria, thanks so much. Maria, today, they're on this very important story. Now, coming up, we look close to the bon-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3850,2022-10-17 08:50:36

[♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ You have to look at UK, and it's been a Greek tragedy what we've seen in UK over the course of the last week with some of the policy announcements in the back and forth. We're at risk of talking ourselves into a worse position than we are. You know, this is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession. Also in some of the other markets where housing is a major component of their economy. So whether it's Hong Kong or Australia, you start to wonder if they aren't the next ones to look at the Chinese economy has been in a recession for some considerable time. In the real economy, for example, bankruptcies, we see already bankruptcies increase. It started in Spain, in Europe, and then in the UK, they're clearly, and now it's reaching Italy, and then France and Germany. To me, the next risk in markets, the next downturn, is the realization that the economies enough to slow a substantial amount to meet those inflation goals. It doesn't mean the whole world is going up and smokes simultaneously. But when you have a situation where we've had very low interest rates for so long, and the world was adapted to it, now that central banks are raising interest rates, it changes things.

15506," to it, to it. Now that central banks are raising interest rates, it changes things. Well, some of our guests are on where the next recession could be, which was our market's live question of the week. Now, rally in Guilts this morning, ahead of the new Chancellor's statement, has bond markets breathing a sigh of relief. Our market's editor, Valerie Taitel, is here to take us through it. Valerie, so what does this mean for broader markets on the fed? Yes, Francine. I'm going to maybe go out and elim there and say, this is some first steps, some calm being restored to the guilt market. Now, we know that it has had an unprecedented amount of volatility, which has been aggravated by a worsening liquidity situation. I have a chart here, which is the Bloomberg guilt liquidity index, which has shown how catastrophic the situation has been in the last few weeks. But if we look forward to what this means to other central banks, if for instance, the guilt market does find some calm liquidity does return, maybe that puts more pressure on other central banks to hike more rapidly. You could say, for example, that the ECB may no longer be worried about liquidity in their BTPs. They don't need to use the TPI tool, just yet. They can continue with their jumbo hikes. Also the same with the fed and treasuries. Janet Yellen warned us last Thursday that she is worried about liquidity in the treasury market. But if the guilt market returns to normal liquidity, maybe that calms the treasury market too. And hey, that could tee us up for back-to-back jumbo hikes from the fed, going 75 in November and December. If they are no longer concerned about this systemic risk of financial stability, impeding their ability to tighten rates. So, Valerie, the biggest concern, of course, is this sharp rise in interest rates. And there are places in the market that are leveraged, that are fine at 1%, that are not fine at 5%. How difficult is it to get through those? Are there parts of the market that you look at to go as an indication of what happens? Yeah, so that is a key risk for central banks moving forward. There are a few metrics we can look at that might give us some hints of stress. One of them is short-term funding in the dollar market. We know that's become even more stress than it was over the Russia sanctions. And then these things like these liquidity indexes, like that is going to be the key driver of the hiccups, in my opinion. It's less so about where the rates rise to, but do central banks need to pause in order to rein in financial stability, i.e. liquidity concerns in their bond markets first? Thank you so much, Valerie. Our markets editor, they're a Valerie Taitel, the very latest on GILTS. Now it is going to be a pretty busy day and busy week for UK assets overall. The pound did rally UK bond surge. Imitate expectations that Prime Minister Liz Truss' package of unfounded tax cuts may actually be reversed. The proof is in the pudding. One of my favorite expressions of the British language, the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, due to make a statement in about an hour and five minutes from now, on measures to support fiscal sustainability. It's the start of what may be a particular toward week for UK assets. So we'll keep it very close to high.

15507," Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third-party apps on the App Store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers of Outstage Manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. When US inflation numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. The CPU in America 40 year high yields are absolutely flying, and it's down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? We are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? The down shift just keeps getting pushed down. Now it looks like we're going into extra-ennings. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's do it. Welcome to DeadBreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology from Bloomberg crypto. The last few years has been a challenging business environment with COVID, with supply restrictions, and of course also the war in Ukraine. Look, I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. The market is really all about short-term trading swings, nothing about fundamentals. There's a lot of bad already booked in this stock market, so we could have a recession, and I'm not so sure the market has to go all out of order. I think the US is in a very different spot than the UK, right? You have a situation in the UK where I've called it a crisis of confidence. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early addition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lyons. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York, and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong are top stories today. Downing street hot seat, the UK's Liz Trass battles to rescue her premiership, the pound and guilt's gain on expectations of more U-turns, has new Chancellor Jeremy Hunts is set to make a fiscal statement in an hour. King of stand, President Xi strikes a defiant tone at his party congress, letting the world know that China wouldn't change course and warned of dangerous storms ahead. And yet another overhaul at Goldman Sachs. David Solomon is embarking on his third major reorganization in just four years as CEO.

New York Kayleigh Lyons is off today and Matt relief in UK assets, it seems, will watch for the statement from the Chancellor in an hour's time. But relief in risk assets more broadly globally, actually this morning. Yeah, absolutely. We see that around the world, not in Japan.

15508," around the world, not in Japan. Take a look at the NICA down a little over 1% at the close. These markets are closed right now. But the Japanese had a little bit of a drop here. And you can see that the pound had a little bit of a drop as well. The dollar gaining a little bit against the pound at 148.73. So we're getting back to those record levels. The hang sang and the CSI 300 were up just a little bit overnight. But you really see that relief in US equity index futures. So take a look at S&P futures this morning. Thereup, of course, we had a huge drop in the cash trade more than 2% on Friday. But right now, we have S&P futures up full 1%. Maybe the concern about, I think, what drove us down on Friday near the end of this session, or after the release of the economic data was the University of Michigan consumer confidence. And of course, the inflation outlook that's really been the key. The US 10-year yield right now coming down a little bit, 390, 590. We're really watching gilts, though. So we're waiting for your boards here. But I'll just show you the dollar index coming down at 1346. You see the pound gaining over there. And crude right now, a little change to 8568. It's really a story all about the UK right now, Anna, because in just an hour's time, we're going to get more from HUD. Yeah, absolutely. So the new chancellor, the fourth that so far this year, still keeping track here in the UK, will make a statement in around an hour's time. Let's have a look at what markets look like as we work our way up towards that, then Matt. This is a picture of strength coming through on European equity markets. We started off in negative territory looking to catch up with what we've missed at the Wall Street session on Friday. The NAS Act was down by more than 3%. But then we've turned that around. We've gone instead with the direction being set by US futures. They pointed in a more positive direction. And as a result, we've got European equity markets moving substantially or actually modestly higher this morning up by 3.10% of 1%. Also, here at the UK assets that you just mentioned, Matt, and so important to get to those, the 30-year gilt yield then falling. And we see demand for gilts. We see demand for fixed income across various geographies. I should point out, but that does look to be specifically the case in the UK. We are seeing gilts coming down across the curve. And more substantially than we see it in other geographies, 30 basis points off the 30-year as you can see. We went above 5% on this particular long duration. And we've seen a lot of different debt products at the height of the concerns around the UK. 11270. The question is really though, are UK assets rallying on what we've seen already, the U-turns around the top rate of tax, corporations tax, the changing of the guard when it comes to the chancellor? Or is it about changes still to come? Is it about policy U-turns to come? Or is it just a different emphasis, a change of tone and a different recognition, I suppose, of market pressures and the current state of the market from the new chancellor that we're focused on here? And more on from our colleague Maria on this one, but a dynamic price gap, whatever that means, being talked about in Europe and she'll help us to understand what that means. And we're not seeing moves higher in gas prices despite those lines coming out of China earlier that they don't want to send any spare gas that they have, LNG gas, that is, to Europe. So that was an interesting narrative. And ITV, I put this stock-specific in there, just to show you there is still some corporate activity taking place. But that stopped up by 8.3%. It's a TV broadcaster, but this is in connection with newspaper reports that suggest their production arm could either be up for sale or there could be interested in some investors in that particular business, so an interesting one there to unlock value. Let's turn to the UK political story, though. The new UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, is due to make a fiscal statement on Britain's fiscal plans in less than an hour. Bloomberg's Lizzie Byrdon joins us now from Downing Street for more on what to expect. Lizzie, what do we expect? Well, Anna, we're expecting a near total dismantling of trussonomics by Jeremy Hunt this morning. More tax cut reversals. Our economists at Bloomberg economics say he needs to find 24 billion pounds worth of revenue razors. Part of the logic behind bringing all of this forward is it allows the fiscal watchdog, the office for budget responsibility, the opportunity to change its forecasts so that markets can reduce the cost of borrowing so that the fiscal hole that Jeremy Hunt has to fill shrinks.

15509," Thursday day of volatility or prices go past a threshold, you'd say, okay, we'll limit up. We're going to close it. The transaction is done and that's your dynamic price cap. Now this is working progress. I've been told the key here is the volatility on the intraday and the price and on that, I'm not sure we're very close to a consensus or an answer to that. I want to get an update on the war. We heard this morning that Russia has hit Kiev again with Kamikaze drones. What do we know? Yeah, and Matt, this is another, well, terrible Monday for Ukraine and we have seen the pictures, terrible pictures coming out from the Ukrainian capital. Of course, they blame the drones. The question is, who is supplying them and who is a maker of them? There's a lot of questions around Iran and today, by the way, we heard from the top European diplomat, Jusaparral, who says they will now, at least the European Union, try to figure out who is supplying this. And if it is indeed Iran, there will be more sanctions to come in the country. On top of the sanctions, by the way, that they will debate about the massive and horrible crackdown that they've done on young women in the country. All right, Maria, thanks very much for the update. Bloomberg's Maria today are giving us the latest on pricing mechanisms in Europe as well as the war that Russia is waging in Ukraine. Now in banking news, Goldman Sachs has said to be combining its IB and trading businesses into one unit that says the bank embarks on its third major reorganization in just four years, Bloomberg's Wall Street correspondent, Shana Ali Basik joins us now with a detail. So another big move from David Solomon, some of this undoing changes that he just made in 2020. Yeah, this is David Solomon's fourth year as CEO and you're seeing him making some major changes, the most notable being some of the consumer banking changes you're seeing. As he does this reorganization, you can expect three major business lines within Goldman Sachs. One being platform solutions run by Stephanie Cohen, who had overseen that consumer business, that will entail transaction banking, you will entail the Apple GM partnerships, any other partnerships. But IB and trading to talk about that for a second here, you do have that business that is more than 60% of the firm still by net revenue, sometimes a lot more in certain quarters, depending on how well the business is doing. The question that David Solomon keeps on having to do for or answer for investors is what roles as a consumer banking operation play, how profitable is it supposed to be over the long term? And how does it keep Goldman Sachs more stable in different types of environments? These are consistent questions for Goldman Sachs. Yeah, consistent question. And we've talked about the retail side of Goldman in recent weeks, and we some of our reporting, Shanali. So looking ahead to this week, we're going to hear from Goldman and Bank of America this week, what do we expect? For Bank of America, remember, JP Morgan had increased their net interest income projections for the year. Can we see similar moves over a bank of America with that booster getting from that interest income? And also a better sense of a handle on costs. There's a lot of questions about jobs out there in the market. Does Bank of America have to cut any to keep their costs in line? Same with Goldman Sachs. We've heard a lot about this story all year. They're kind of led, if you will, on this idea of efficiency this year. Levers on compensation. Remember that Goldman Sachs, with this leadership shake-up, we'll expect to hear a lot more in their earnings call tomorrow, as leaders are expected to change across business lines. We've reported many of them in Bloomberg's story today. So just everyone, take a look on just how much is changing because it is certainly a lot in that. Shanaali, thanks very much. We'll be back, Shanaali Bassack, with the latest on the banking sector. Coming up on the program, we will be talking about the UK and indeed about China, a different political dynamics to discuss today with Robin Nibbletz, who joins us, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House. We look forward to talking to Sir Robin Nibblet, a little bit later on. And John McLean, also with this brandy wine, global portfolio manager, what does his strategy look like right now as we head towards the end of the year, I suppose, we could say? Now, plus how Russian ships are laundering grain, stolen from occupied Ukraine. Read more on today's big-take story. That can be found online or on the Bloomberg terminal.

15510," See you next time! We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on it pays them, and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers. This is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when a White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. The learning season is here. It's not just pricing for nothing. It's not that big an exceeding. Everyone is expecting it to be poor. It has big mark downs on earning. Bloomberg breaks the numbers first. The bar has already been set pretty well. The big question is can it go lower or seems a pretty bad earnings? Already, can those who have reported it? With exclusive expert analysis. Which aspects of the market are not sufficiently priced? Is this a macro-cute headwind? There is some really bright light at the end of this tunnel. When is this floor going to come? When can I stop on it? Bloomberg Television and Radio. The fastest numbers and analysis you trust. This is Bloomberg's surveillance earlier this year. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in New York. Kaley Lines is off today. The UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to make a statement on Britain's fiscal plans in less than an hour. This comes as Liz Truss's position as UK Prime Minister is coming under increased pressure, following a series of U-turns on a mini budget. Joining us now is Robin Nibbler, a distinguished fellow at Chatham House. So Robin, really good to have you with us. Thank you very much for joining us. What would you put Liz Truss's chances of survival at right now? I think we've only seen three MPs from the party come forward and say that they don't want her to be Prime Minister anymore. Of course, there's a lot of talk about people behind the scenes saying that less openly. What is your expectation for whether she survives? Well, an incredibly difficult question. The first thing I'd say is that a lot, I think, depends on whether markets stabilize this week. Let's see how Jeremy Hunt performs at 11 o'clock when he puts on the table. What more he rose back and how he closes that very large hole. There's some people estimate that it'd been between 60 and 70 billion, not just the 45 billion that was in the quasi-quarting budget. I think if markets stabilize, then the desire of the Conservative Party not to reveal is continuing deep divisions by having another leadership contest will prevail over the next few years. I'll prevail over the deep disappointment frustration anger at the performance of the Prime Minister over these last six weeks. We have a new chancellor, of course, then Sir Robin. What should the focus of Jeremy Hunt's address today in, as we say, less than an hour's time? Do you think the focus of his address?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3857,2022-10-17 09:22:24
15511," We have a new chancellor, of course, then Sir Robin. What should the focus of Jeremy Hunts' address today, in, as we say, less than an hour's time? What do you think the focus of his address should be? Clearly, he wants to try to stabilize or continue to see stability in UK assets. What should he focus on? Well, I think most of the reversals of the tax package have been fairly well-trailed. And so I think, as people have been saying, they'll probably be torching most of the quasi-quarting mini-budget barring the step that already been taken or nationally insurance, lowering that level, which was supported by Labour. That's only going to save, along with a couple of other measures, stamp duty probably giving you about 15 billion of the 45 billion whole. And as I noted earlier, a lot of the estimates are there that it might be a 60-70 billion shortfall. So I think where he's going to have to focus actually is on the discipline of spending. That is the really difficult part. This government isn't just rolling back the tax cuts, if you want to call them all, the tax savings. They're actually going to have to make public savings in public spending. Where do you do that? As you're digging out from the COVID crisis, you can't do it in health, you can't cut education anymore. I think there's some hope that they can move the markets with their sense of stability and therefore reduce one of the very important new big expenditures, which is the larger spending on the debt, debt is risen, debt is more expensive, the UK is spending a lot more on it. They can change that expectation that may shave another 5, 10 billion a year off their expectations. What does this mean, Robin, for life in the UK and for the possibility of a recession that's deeper than maybe had been previously expected? Look, I think the possibility of a recession is high, not least because mortgage rates are up way before, you know, way higher than they were before. Mortgage just tend to affect those parts of the British economy that spend. It is that middle class space that is so important for economic activity. So yeah, and of course, if there is a sense of recession, then the GDP growth figures are going to be, well, obviously negative for a recession, that then makes the ability to hit the growth targets necessary to make the economy have its sums that up. Now, that much more difficult. So look, we were looking at maybe squeezing an 0.3, 0.2, 0.4% gain in GDP last next year. It might now be heading into negative-turching. It's just very, very hard to see right now. Is there any chance, as they're looking for levers to pull on to put things in reverse as it were, is there any chance that they can reduce some of the hard Brexit measures that haven't been good for the economy? Look, unfortunately, again, the best that can be done right now is not to make things worse. Brexit is, whatever, some people say, a drag on the British economy. It is costing it potential growth for as long as it takes to get into a better relationship with the EU. What we were worried about, a lot of people were worried about under Liz Truss. Things might get worse with a confrontation over the Northern Ireland protocol. Already, Liz Truss was worrying back on that, better mood music. But all we talk about here is not making things worse. I think there's no capacity right now to make the situation better with the EU economically. A lot of people have made quite a big deal, Robyn. And I wonder what your view of this is of some of the changing mood music around some of the Brexit themes in the UK. So slightly better tone over Northern Ireland negotiations, for example, reported over the last couple of weeks. A piece in the telegraphed over the weekend saying, Project Fear, which was the Brexit arms view of the remains side, Project Fear was right over all, talking about the reduced standing of Britain in the world. Do you read anything either short or long term into that kind of narrative? Well, the extent the telegraph is even putting this stuff up is a change in tone. But I'm afraid the battle lines within the Conservative Party are deeply, deeply written. And this is one of the reasons why I think they can't afford right now another change in Prime Minister. Because there are many people who've staked their careers, their whole political lives on the belief that when the UK leaves the EU, growth will be unleashed. And this is part of what the kind of Britannia unchained idea of quasi-quarting. And this trust was a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3858,2022-10-17 09:26:36

15513," This is part of what the kind of Britannia unchained idea of quasi-quarting and this trust was about. So to simply abandon that, say, oh, we've got to recognize our costs would require a complete rebooting the relationship. Remember Boris Johnson signed what was the thinnest possible trade deal with the EU, the trade incorporation agreement, which by the way, just by naming it is kind of the weakest type of trade agreement you would have to improve the terms of British access to the EU markets would be a long term process, something that you would probably have to go into the next election as part of your platform. But as I said, you can't make an adjustment in the literally two to three to six months that we're talking about here to steer the economy in the right direction. Now, afraid, I said, there are people who have state their careers on this. They're inside the Conservative Party and they will make life very difficult if this trust were to try to turn the boat around too sharply. I wanted to just ask while we have you, Rob, because you're also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, what was your take on Xi's speech yesterday? How do we know that China is sort of setting its course going forward with him in the third term? Look, with Chinese politics, as I read it, and many people who know Chinese politics better than I do, but as I read it, we are where Xi Jinping had already planned us to be two to three years ago. You know, he set up in 2017 the plan that he would be able to extend his term into an unprecedented, at least in the modern era, third term as the leader of the Communist Party. So that's in itself a big shift. I think until we see who are the winners and losers of the merry go round who's going to be on the standing committee of the Politburo, which we won't see until the 23rd after this party, 20th party congress has been completed. We're not going to get the full picture, but from what he gave in his speech yesterday, no shift in the COVID policy, a strong statement about rejecting foreign interference. But I thought very importantly, some nuanced language on Taiwan. Yes, you know, a refusal to take the use of force off the table if they're forced, but a very strong statement for the preference for a peaceful transition. And very importantly, associating changes in Taiwan with the national rejuvenation of China. This phrase, the rejuvenation of China is linked very much to the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, which takes place in 2049. So, you know, a lot of people have been worried that 2027 in five years time might be sort of unwritten deadline over Taiwan. A lot of the experts who are looking at the speech field that he's been trying to buy some more space to focus on what is a really difficult domestic agenda. You know, a property market that's on its knees, and economy that's not growing from us enough because of the COVID lockdowns. Global export markets, which China still depends on in very tough position, because of the recessions in Europe and the US. Thank you, Ruben. The America. Thanks so much for joining us. The Robin Nibblet of Shatterm House. Yes, a very comprehensive answer, and we really appreciate it. Thank you so much for joining us. And next up, we'll talk about markets once again.

15514," Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks App. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers. I'm Mark Garmin, this is Power On. This is Bloomberg's surveillance edition. Here's what you need to know. Downing streets, hot seat, the UK's list trials battles to rescue her premiership, the pound and guilt gain on expectations of more U-turns as New Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is set to make a fiscal statement in half an hour. Taking a stand, President Xi strikes a defiant tone at his party congress, letting the world know that China wouldn't change course and warned of dangerous storms ahead. And yet another overhaul at Goldman Sachs, David Solomon is embarking on his third major reorganization in just four years as CEO. Goldman and Bank of America take their turn in the earnings spotlight this week. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in New York, Kayleigh Lines is off today. A Matt at risk appetite seems to have returned, US futures point higher, European stocks, almost all sectors are higher, but utilities the biggest gaming sector doesn't have an incredibly bullish feel to it. Yeah, no, it's really kind of the roller coaster just continuing, right? After we dropped on Thursday post inflation figures, then saved by the algorithms, so many people say Friday, push back down again by inflation expectations to the tune of more than 2% in the cash trade. So now we're seeing a bit of a bounce in futures. This morning still four hours ago until the bell, but we're up more than 1% on S&P futures. The US 10 year yield coming down, so investors buying that debt right now, it's 390, 426. I heard someone this morning say you won't realize things are normal in the UK. I think it was Marcus Ashworth until your 10 year yield on GILTS is lower than ours on treasuries. And we're getting there to some extent, although this isn't really helping that calculus. The US dollar index coming down a bit, we do see a stronger, pound stronger Euro against the dollar right now, 1345 is the Bloomberg US dollar index level and 9x crude unchanged right now at 8560. So I'm not telling us a lot about risk appetite, but that could be good news for stocks as we get closer and closer to the open. And what do you see in Europe? Yeah, I've got to focus on UK assets for you, but before we get there, the stocks across Europe broadly speaking up today up by 6 cents of 1%. As I mentioned to you, Matt, most sectors in positive territory, but utilities the biggest gain of their so it's slightly defensive feel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3860,2022-10-17 09:33:48
15515," You get the stocks across Europe broadly speaking up by 6.1% as I mentioned to you Matt. Most sectors in positive territory but utilities are the biggest gainer there so it's a slightly defensive feel perhaps to that and some of the moves that we're seeing in commodity markets of course maybe behind that. Here's the UK focus then. I haven't got the 10 year yield for you Matt but I've got the 30 year 4.43%. And it's an interesting question to ask where this should settle out because of course we're seeing buying of gills. We're seeing some relief in the markets. The Bank of England not active in the same way that they were. They do have some schemes in place. You can go post collateral at the Bank of England. In exchange for cash if you're certain types of pension funds and they're hedging managers. But we are seeing broadly speaking the markets managing to survive on their own. And we see yields coming down by 35 basis points at the long end. But where should we settle? This is still well above the sort of 3.5% we were at before we got the run up to the mini budget. Of course it's a rising rates environment and should there be a premium attached to UK assets as a result of what we've seen in recent weeks. The pound at 112.86 so recovery once again in UK assets there. But this is an anticipation of U-turns still to come. And what happens if we don't get an eight that's one of the questions of course. Natural gas prices down by 4.5%. As we were hearing from our colleague Maria earlier on Matt. This all in connection with a dynamic price cap it's been described as now. Will we be able to see any agreement though across European leaders they will meet later on this week to talk about it. All right we'll be looking forward to that. Also looking forward to earnings coming across today. We're going to get a number of big banks bank of New York, Melon, Bank America coming out with earnings Schwab coming out with earnings. So it'll be interesting to see what we get this morning truest as well. John McLean Brandy wine global portfolio manager joins us now to talk about what to expect. Is this going to change our focus John? We've been so macro and you can see that you know the UK guilt market moves develop markets around the world. Are we going to start to focus in really on earnings now? Yeah it's time to pass the torch from macro to micro here and I think earnings will be fine in 3Q but really it's all about the guidance for 4Q and I think that's where we're going to see the weakness. And I think that's really where that narrative is going to form around we are in a recession going into recession. There's no real way to avoid it here. And so we're waiting to hear you know at the micro level from companies about what they're seeing on the ground and how quickly things have changed. You're focused in on high yield and corporate credit strategy specifically. What are you looking at? Yeah and what I'm looking at is really capital allocation priorities for management teams and what we've seen is a meaningful shift and that's why we want to go long CEOs and corporate American short politicians. We say that look corporate America's focused on profitability. I think that a lot of these companies are going to be proactive on their labor force meaning reduction in labor force to maintain margins and really you know I think that since COVID companies have been focused on liquidity and preserving liquidity on the balance sheet. So we come into this recessionary type of environment from a place of strength in terms of the balance sheet for corporate America. Good to speak to you John. You want to see that passing the baton from the macro to the micro but to linger on the macro for a moment do you still see spill overs from what we've experienced in the UK and that big rise up and run up in guilt yields. Do you still see evidence of that in the markets in which you are active? I'm thinking of US corporate debt or collateralized loan obligations and various parts of the market that people have reported to us. You've seen sort of sympathy selling. Oh absolutely. Still over from the biggest most liquid markets really the underlying risk free rate determines pricing across every other asset class and so when you can't accurately determine what the value is of a 30 year guilt or a 30 year US treasury it makes it really hard to price equities and high yield and corporate credit risk. So until we slow down the rate volatility that we've seen in developed market economies that you know I think we're going to see meaningful volatility in our marketplace and that's going to go on for the foreseeable future here and really again yes I see the risk of many more policy errors because politicians are focused on appeasing constituents across the globe they're not listening to shareholders. Yes I mean we had a nice piece of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3861,2022-10-17 09:38:19
15516," years because politicians are focused on appeasing constituents across the globe. They're not listening to shareholders. Yes, I mean, we had a nice piece out over the weekend talking about a wider tug of war between central banks and governments. Don, do you see that playing out in other geographies? Absolutely. I mean, I think, you know, the UK part of the first shot, I think Europe's going to really struggle here. I think we're going to be fighting inflation with fiscal stimulus. Yes, we've done a little bit of that in the US already as well. And I think there's more to come. And that's not the right medicine for the market. And that prolongs the pain. Wait, fighting inflation with fiscal stimulus? Doesn't fiscal stimulus sort of cause inflation? Absolutely. But, you know, I think a lot of politicians have in red economics one-on-one textbooks. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Listen, the liquidity is a problem in especially in your markets, right? Well, we heard Janet Yellen last week say she's concerned about it in treasuries, which was I think very interesting. And it looks like the tide continues to go out. How does that affect your strategy? Oh, absolutely. Look, you know, everyone wants to talk about the Fed put as a relate to equities. There is no Fed put as a relate to equities. The Fed put is around functioning capital markets, functioning fiscal marketplace. And when you go back to COVID and you couldn't spot a treasure, you couldn't trade, you know, in the biggest most liquid markets, that was a real problem. And we're not completely there yet. But certainly we've seen a meaningful deterioration in the marketplace. And as it relates to my marketplace, in particular in high yield, we've really seen the dealers Wall Street step away from the marketplace. They're not providing liquidity in the market today because the banks are focused on balance sheet. They're looking their wounds from underwriting a lot of pretty nasty LBO deals here. And so, yeah, I think that liquidity is challenging. I think that the Fed should be paying attention to this. And I think that the Fed most likely breaks financial markets before the break in place. Yeah, that's interesting. We've talked about that a few times. And so you warn us, be careful what you wish for. Slowing hikes means something broke. We will watch to see what breaks then, John.

One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. Like it. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition on Matt Miller in New York with Anna Edwards in London. Kaley Lines is off today. Well, Rally in Guilt this morning has bond markets breathing a sigh of relief. Valerie Tytel takes us through what this could mean for broader markets and for the Fed. Thanks, Matt. I'm going to go out and know them there and say that this means that liquidity and the dampening of volatility is going to happen now in the guilt market. As we know, liquidity has been worsening and worsening even over the weeks that the bill we have done their operations. But now that we have some calm restoring to the market, I think the key theme for this is that the calm is going to go into treasuries and then into BTPs, which is actually going to embolden those central banks to hike rates more. I think that this means we are teed up for 75 basis points back to back jumbo hikes from both the Fed and the ECB as we head into the close of 2022. Okay, Valerie, thank you very much. Valerie Tytel, we've heard views on what's happening in guilt markets and the spillovers into other markets. You can see Valerie's charts and all of our terminal analysis via GTV Go. That is the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal to get hold of those charts we discuss. Eddie Vanderbilt joins us. Bloomberg markets live. Editha and Eddie, we want to talk to you about crypto. But let's linger on what Valerie was just proposing there, which is that if this is the start of more calmness in bond markets, does that mean central banks feel more emboldened to hike? And perhaps more emboldened to go back to will continue those QT plans. Yeah, absolutely. You know what, if somebody said to me a couple of months ago that the UK market was going to set the tone for global asset prices, I wouldn't have believed it. But really, we have seen that over the last few weeks, right? We've seen the pound blowout, we've seen a UK yields blowout and that feeling through into wider markets. And that is something that I think, you know, if we can see some calm restored as a result of more liquidity in UK markets, I think that will definitely play, you know, wealth asset prices broadly and emboldened the Fed. So I buy that argument. Eddie, what do you think, I mean, looking at commodities and pulling in crypto to that, what do you think of the lack of volatility that we've seen in Bitcoin? It continues to hover around $19,000. So it's like, GILTS can whipsaw the treasury market, but not do anything to Bitcoin. Yeah, absolutely. Look, I think crypto is still underlying, it's still quite volatile compared to, say, the pound or something else. But look, I think we've always expected crypto to become less volatile as it matures. As it become ingrained in broader financial markets. So that is definitely something that we are seeing at the moment. And I think that is healthy for the crypto space. Some in the crypto space will be sorry because they will want that volatility, you know, because they love the trading activity. But I think, you know, I think it's good to see that signs of maturity. I do also think that if Bitcoin becomes more explosive to the upside, particularly in the next couple of years, that volatility returns. How do you see the institutional involvement here? I mean, does it just continue to ramp up? Do they really build a base? Is that why we see, you know, this floor at $19,000 that seems fairly stable? Look, I think institutional imbias do come in. I think because they have the products now. There are some institutions that would like to buy some hedge funds that wouldn't have been comfortable to buy crypto outright. They can do it by ETFs. They can do it by a futures markets now. Are they the ones providing a floor at $19,000? I'm not sure that they are. But I do think that if we see another leg up, you know, they will want to pile in via the ETFs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3863,2022-10-17 09:46:57
15518," in $1,000? I'm not sure that they are, but I do think that if we see another leg up, they will want to pile in via the ETF. So I think it's not exactly a double-edged sword, but I do think the institutions have made themselves a standing part of the crypto market. And do crypto traders? Well, what do they do when volatility disappears, then Eddie? Are there other strategies available other than go by pounds and gills? Exactly, which is exactly the strategy I was going to suggest. Look, there are, I think when you trade crypto currencies and you buy them outright, buy and hold, then I think, you know, it's the volatility, die down, and volatility is one thing. If you're willing to trade derivatives, then it's another thing. I think, you know, I think, and also some of the smaller cryptocurrencies offer them a lot more opportunities to play that volatility. Eddie, thanks so much for joining us, Eddie Vanderbilt there of Bloomberg's Bloomberg Market Live. The blog, MLIVGO on your terminal, is what you type to get that and follow along with all of the market moves throughout the day. Tune in, by the way, to Bloomberg Crypto, that's every Tuesday on Bloomberg Television, 1 p.m. New York Times, 6 p.m. in London, or weekly show that covers the people transactions and technology shaping the world of decentralized finance. This is Bloomberg. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating. The way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

15519," The last few years has been a challenging business environment with Covid, with supply restrictions and of course also the war in Ukraine that drives energy prices. If you coupled that with interest rates, you know, the economy might cool down but we've always had these cycles and we have gone through the cycles. If you have a resilient brand like Mercedes-Benz with a very loyal customer base, I think we're going to be prepared for whatever may come. Europe in particular will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany that's been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short to midterm challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer, mid to long term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables. That was the CEO of Mercedes-Benz speaking with Bloomberg's Caroline Konal at the Paris Car Show. I think really interesting because this is one company that is dead set on going 100% electric. You've heard that from Ola a number of times and the EQE is just one more piece of that puzzle. They're also dead set on trying to replace gas or fossil fuels in terms of their electricity. They signed up with a company to get to tap a wind farm in the Baltic Sea. They are building their own new wind farm at the Pappenburg test track. So it's really interesting that they're looking for a way to make up these shortfalls. They're very proactive. Yeah, absolutely. I was saying the thing is that the energy story is all over this business at the moment, both the energy used by their customers to power their vehicles and also the energy that they use themselves to make the cars in the first place. Interesting on supply chains as we look ahead to the earnings season. We're still getting the car sector at that Paris Air Show then Matt talking about the difficulties in supply chains. Yes, things are getting better but delays still there. Elevated prices for chips. Yeah, absolutely. I mean the chip problem is not yet solved. Even though we see chip makers with a glut of PC chips, they still don't have enough or they're not delivering enough chips to be used in cars. And we could see that combined with the energy crisis bringing down production in Europe, S&P Global recently put out a report that said by a million vehicles a quarter. Let's get a look at what's ahead today at the top of the next hour. The new UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is expected to make a fiscal statement or statement on his fiscal policy. We'll get earnings from Bank America today as well as a number of others Goldman Sachs coming out around 730. Tech earnings also getting underway with Netflix and Tesla reporting results. And then if today is not enough for you on Wednesday, we're going to get UK and Euro area inflation data. Then Neil Cash Carry, Charles Evans, Jim Bullard, all among the Fed speakers set to give us more indications this week of their policy inclinations. Go ahead and type Fed go on your Bloomberg terminal for more details there. Let's get back to Goldman Sachs and barking on its third major re-organ just four years. The bank reports third quarter results. Wait, is it tomorrow? Is it finance reporter Charlie Wells joins us right now. Charlie, I know there's a ton of banks coming out. Is Goldman Sachs tomorrow? Goldman Sachs is tomorrow and Goldman Sachs also knows that it needs to find a way to generate fees in any environment. Now this is a bank that is the epitome of Wall Street. It has a sterling reputation when it comes to investment banking and trading. Those units perform exceptionally well when the market is up. But when the market is down like now, the story is incredibly difficult and different. So CEO David Solomon has been looking for ways to find more standardized fee sources. He thought he found a way forward with consumer banking as Shredart and Tara John here at Bloomberg has been breaking story after a story though. The bank has been challenged in the consumer banking sector. So David Solomon moonlights as a DJ. He knows that people like Remix's but three and four years that might be too many. Okay. Nice. I see what you did there. Very good. Very good. Of course, Bank of America reporting in just a few minutes then. We had lots of banks reporting on Friday and we learned a lot, didn't we, about what a tough time this is for banks that focus on May on Wall Street and a better time. Thank you Jerome Powell for the higher interest rates for those that operate on Main Street. Yeah, so the news from Friday could actually bode particularly well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3865,2022-10-17 09:55:33
15520," that focus on May on Wall Street and a better time. And thank you Jerome Powell for the higher interest rates for those that operate on Main Street. Yeah, so the news from Friday could actually bode particularly well for Bank of America. So what we saw and what really stuck out was JP Morgan reporting its best ever net interest income for a quarter. So we know that Bank of America looks a little bit more similar to say JP Morgan than a Goldman Sachs. Net interest income there is expected to be about $13.6 billion. That's up a billion dollars from the previous quarter and a significant improvement from the year before. So it's looking like there could be good news, of course Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America, even going around last week saying he had faith in the strength of the American consumers. So how strong is that American consumer and how long will that strength last? I think if that's the question we need to be asking ourselves as well. Yeah, I was gonna ask you, what are you looking for specifically in the outlooks, Charlie, and I guess loan demand and consumer spending are the kind of indications we wanna get a picture of. Huge focus on those. I think what we really interesting is to look at Bank of America's mortgage unit, right? So mortgage strength has been pretty good overall over the past year, but the housing market is cooling. That's something that I really wanna focus on with Bank of America. If we think about Goldman, I think one position that I'm really struck by is the potential 54% decline in fees from banking. And so when you look at numbers like that, when you look at revenue expected to be down 16% compared with last year, it's no wonder that we're talking about something of a restructure for that bank, and especially when you compare it to its peers like JP Morgan and Bank of America. Okay, Charlie, thanks so much. Bloomberg's Charlie Wells with the latest on the banking sector. Stay tuned for more on that, of course, this week. Matt, let's briefly mention a couple of lines coming through on the UK story. The Bank of England planning to resume sales of corporate bonds next week. Of course, this was part of the QT program. It was only really just starting at the Bank of England when the politics overtook. Melissa, honestly, on the sale. When they turned back to QE. Yeah, and they had to introduce very targeted, they would probably say, bond buying at the long end of the guilt curve to support the pension's industry and some of the hedging products that were in place or at least give them time to unwind that position. But you're right, they had to briefly do something else. And now it seems they are attempting, at least, to go back to it. So corporate bonds sales, that program will resume next week. And then, I guess, in just a few minutes, we hear more details from, is it fair to say the new leader of the UK? Well, that would be controversial. The UK government would say, no, not so. I mean, maybe the market is the new leader of the UK. Certainly, the market putting UK policies back in their box and unwinding certain UK policies around that so-called mini budget turns out to have a more maxi effects on UK assets, as we know. Guilt yields have been coming down as we expect further, the UK government, waiting to see what Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, delivers, he's going to be speaking in just a few minutes time. We'll bring you that, of course. This is Linda. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. Well, we've asked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3866,2022-10-17 09:59:57
15521," and see some related kinds of things in the near future. It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in, to work with us, to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform, probabilities are, they're not all non-securities. Now there's another issue that's as arisen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age, where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's go to Bloomberg. Welcome to DeadBreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. You have a situation in the UK where I've called at a crisis of confidence. This is going to monitor policy appear to be moving in completely opposite directions. The Bank of England is having to try and manage the chaos that the government has been creating in the bond market. The bond market of digital ant is a back. What we had in the UK really is symptomatic of what is happening elsewhere. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Here we go again, live from New York City from our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio. Alongside Tom Keane and Lisa Brown with some Jonathan Farrow with equally futures TK up a little more than 1%. You're going to say same week, same whatever. I wasn't going to say that. That's OK. I wasn't going to work out particularly on Bloomberg radio at worldwide. What an extraordinary week. John, we start up with the same surprise that we've had all the news in the United Kingdom and you can brief us. You know it better than me. John, to me, all I need to know is I got restriction, restriction, restriction on the screen, the Bloomberg Financial Conditions index is where it's been every moment except the beginning of COVID. The Supervolatile last week, Kit Joukes of Sok Jen on the UK this morning. Lisa, you're loved this line too. Goodbye, crisis, hello recession. The vigilantes when we hear from the chancellor a little bit later this morning. So we talked about this last week, who blinks. It is, of course, the blinking of the fiscal policy makers with a new regime, Jeremy Hunt, going to be speaking today. We'll go through all of that. But the key question is, what can he do to really restore credibility for this administration at a time when there still is a huge risk premium baked into both the guilt market as well as the pound? And dare I say on a technical basis, might Wilson and Morgan Stanley almost on the edge of constructive this morning, guys, Lisa, just almost there. Technically, it's sort of the keyword. I mean, basically, he's saying like, ah, things could look good and then they're going to look really, really bad. He's basically saying there could be a 16% rally. And then you look at the downside and it's pretty dire. Until companies fully confess or a recession officially arrives, Bank of America, Tom, like to the sound. Some of the research notes are really, really interesting. John DeStagin in November 2nd, what I would say, and this comes off the Washington meetings, is everybody in America's focused on the inflation story, the recession story, and that, the rest of the world's focused on dollar liquidity and the shortage of dollars out there. And you see it deep in the Bloomberg screen, there's a tension on a Monday morning that wasn't there a week ago. Let's put it through the price section just briefly for you this Monday morning, start with the equity market. We are elevated on the S&P 500 futures high by a little more than one four percentage point. The volatility yesterday, just absolutely ridiculous or rather on Friday, the volatility in the football yesterday, quite an incredible time. Did you catch city Liverpool? I saw it and, you know, I can't translate it, but the Liverpool defense was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3867,2022-10-17 10:04:22
15522," on Friday. The volatility in the football yesterday. Quite an incredible time. Did you catch City Liverpool? I saw it and you know, I can't translate it, but the Liverpool defence was worldwide. But you found out finally how to get a game. Yes. Steped up. We'll touch on that later. You would come in six or seven bases points on a ten yet. 394.87. We can discuss them later. Euro. Stronger. Euro. $97.50. And crude. Bram. 85.77. Up by a little more than a tenth of 1%. Call it two tenths of 1% higher. Yeah. Thanks so much. So what I'm looking at right now, of course, 830 AM. We get some economic data. But before then, we're looking at Jeremy Hunt and potentially Happen when he starts speaking in about a half an hour time. And then again to the House of Commons at around 1030 Eastern. What does he say to give some support? There had been a lot of discussion over the weekend, different talk shows and he had been pretty encouraging. We are seeing a bit of a dip in yields across all Machirties. Isn't enough if you take a look at how we've Performed year to date yields are still incredibly high. And the pound is still incredibly low relative. It's the dollar incredibly weak, even though you have seen a Bit of a bounce on the heels of this. Then we do get some more earnings. Bank of America earnings out around 645 AM. 830 AM. We get the earnings call. Do they give the same kind of constructive feel that we heard From JP Morgan? Or do they give more of a sense of the Consumer a little bit more strain? I mean we're not seeing that Yet right now, Bank of America shares up to and a half percent in The pre market and 830 AM. We get US October manufacturing data As well as what we're getting with the empire manufacturing. How much do we get a sense of a desaleration, a rapid Desaleration in inflation and in activity at a time when This really is a tea leave that is probably the first real Data that we get out of October. The city economic Surprise index, Sean. This is interesting to me. It's been trending upward. We've actually seen positive Surprises. Is that a good thing or a bad thing for economists That want to see this economy roll over sooner so the Fed Doesn't have to do quite as much. Did you see you Mitch on Friday? Yeah, that was concerning. There you go. The chairman of the Federal Reserve says to look at it, Tom. So we look at it. University of Michigan one year consumer Inflation expectations 5.1%. On the lift. On the lift here and this is these words that float around Credibility and the idea of anchored unanchored. There's 14 flavors. There's 14 different opinions. I'm not going to lean on it other than to say, usually I Ignore you University of Michigan and I understand right now It's got a value. Laurie Kavasinichoy just now the head of US equity strategy at RBC capra markets. Laurie, what's In about three q earnings? It was a bad guy. It's for 4q and beyond. What do we learn so far? So look, I think if so far in reporting season, John, I've Been a little bit disappointed that it sounded a lot like the Last couple reporting season. So we're hearing things like The tone around labor is improving a little bit. Not seen any major crack shed in terms of either the consumer Or demand, but companies are batting down the hatches and Getting ready for choppy or time. So at least there's that. But I think that in terms of you know, if you wanted the Earnings Band-Aid ripped off and that's what a lot of Investors have been telling me so far what I'm hearing is I don't know if we're going to get it this reporting season. I think we may have to wait till you know February march to Get that. Laurie, you and Ben Leiter on the same page. Ben Leiter starts off by saying the first ever so slight Glance here at earnings are a less bad start. And then you talk about moving to high quality to find what High quality is is a comfortable place to be. So high quality is a factor discussion that I have with Lot of investors. If you talk to your average portfolio Managers small cap or large cap, especially in the small Cap space odds are they've done some sort of back test that Tells them that things like positive earnings and high R a week outperform over time. So come invest with me because That's the perfect portfolio I run. And so what we're Starting to see is that after a summer in which the low Quality stats so negative earners highly shorted names negative R O E low R O E those names were actually working pretty well Coming off the June low on a relative basis and what we're Seeing now is that more of the high quality versions right Positive earners the high R O E the lowly shorted names are starting to work Which frankly Tom is a silver lining heading into the end of The year because that actually votes well for active manager And so the lowly and this goes to the risk free rate returning Here and maybe it has to do with big combinations like Kruger And Albert's in but all of a sudden the zombies have to report As what we're really talking about here is not high quality But that all of a sudden it's zombie November. I think that's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3868,2022-10-17 10:09:39
15523," But that all of a sudden it's zombie November. I think that's a fair way to look at it Tom, but I would also say it depends on your definition of zombie a little bit. I think that in general when you're going into a lower growth uncertain time, investors do cling to those higher quality names. And typically those are the ones that do come through, manage through challenging situations a little bit better. So I think that investors are sort of circling, not closing the ranks and really just clinging to what's worked over time. And as a lot of PM say to me, you're not going to get beaten up by sticking to your philosophy, where you are going to get beaten up as if you underperform when you've deviated from your philosophy. Lori, how much could you see the S&P getting to that 3200 level, which is the base case for Mike Wilson over at Morgan Stanley, even with some of the constructive field that you have in select names and select industries? So I think it's a great question Lisa. And I understand why that number is important. You know, when I talk to my friends in the technical strategy community, they'll often say 3500, 3200 or kind of the next big battlegrounds. And I see that as well from the fundamental perspective. 3500 is your median recession drawdown, a 27% drawdown from peak. But if the market starts to think that the Fed is not going to be able to pull that off, and that we're going to price in something more challenging from an economic perspective, an average drawdown is about 32% in a recession going back to the 30s. And that takes you to that 3200 mark. And if you go back to the pandemic, Lisa, we lost 34% peak to drop. And so I think that 3200 mark if 35 doesn't hold, I think 3200 is the next natural place to go. But it's hard for me to imagine we go too much lower than that, just because in the face of the pandemic, I mean, frankly, when life was on the line, and there was just a massive uncertainty ahead of investors, that's only as bad as the market fell. So I think 3200 is a good place to look if 3500 doesn't hold. But 3500 is proving to be a major battleground here for the reason. Lori, how hard is it to convince some of your clients to be optimistic, to be constructive when there is this high likelihood of that psychological level on the index? I think that what's interesting is I talked to people about it from a positioning perspective. What is the next big thing that you need to do? And I show them my charts basically showing that defensives are at peak valuation relative to both sick with goals and secular growth. And I tell them, you know, I've been traveling around the country. Pretty non-stop since June, and I tell them, you know, everyone I talk to has plenty of defense. They've cleaned up their portfolios. They own as much staples or utilities as they're ever going to own. The next thing to do is to go on offense. And that really resonates with a lot of people because they know from that experience over the summer, going back to the conversation with Tom about quality. When the low quality stuff started to move, that is not where they were positioned. And that's where they started to see some underperformance in their portfolio. So I think people understand that if you're a longer term investor, eventually the tide will turn. And frankly, there's just not a lot people need to do anymore on the defensive side. They're already there. Hey, Laurie. Want to put a catch up with you? Laurie Kavasinad there on the latest in this market from RBC. The latest from the UK. Just getting this from the chancellor. The measures announced today will raise 32 billion sterling. The UK to shorten universal energy support to April 2023. So the chancellor in the UK just shortening the duration of the support they'll offer to offset some of the pain and energy to April 2023 to scrap the plan to cut income tax indefinitely from the chancellor. More difficult decisions are coming on spending. So Tom, this isn't just a U-turn. This is a massive change in terms of who is running the Treasury and what they're doing. Sterling with a pop here, John, right away from a 112 50 to a 113. Nice pop breaking out to 114 would be a huge deal. Reminds me something. You said this morning, Tom, when he said goodbye, crisis, hello recession. These kind of initiatives are arguably going to get us there quicker. Because I was away, John, you and I barely talk. Wait, we barely talk anyways. But besides that, this guy ran the Olympics. What does it mean to you that the chancellor, the exchequer, the guy that did the very successful? I didn't know that London Olympics. It's not a trivia, but to me, my God, that's going to be the toughest chap going to run an Olympics. He's like Mr. Organization, right? Do you think he could run a marathon right now? The reason I asked that, Tom, is because I wonder how long he'll be in the job. I do. I think that's funny. I think that's funny. I think this Prime Minister will be in the job. So this Prime Minister right now, Tom, just seems to me, at least a please way in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3869,2022-10-17 10:13:16
15524," I wonder how long he'll be in the job. I think that's funny, dude. I do, I think that's funny. I thought, well, how long this Prime Minister will be in the job. So for this Prime Minister right now, Tom, just seems to me, at least a police way in, that this is the phrase we used on Friday, that you have a Prime Minister in office, but not in power. And these headlines this morning kind of confirm that. Yeah, a lot of people comparing her tenure to the shop life of lettuce. That's one of the analogies. You know, they're doing a race. I think one newspaper in the UK is doing a race. We've got a picture of her framed and a letter. Trust counter to see what lasts longer. Steve Chevron in the next hour, 70 am Eastern time, looking forward to that. Futures up on ESSE and plebe by more than 1%. From New York City, Guy Johnson, Adderland and coming up shortly. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with views from around the world with the first word news, I'm Leanne Gehrens. Ukraine's government says Russia has launched kamikaze drones this morning. The explosions hit the centre of Kiev, damaging several residential homes. It is a second strike on the capital in a week in Luxembourg, European Union foreign ministers, or due to agree on the launch of a new mission to train around 15,000 Ukrainian personnel in the EU and sign off an additional $487 million in weapons of financing. Now, EU nations have agreed to a new package of sanctions on Iran over human rights violations relating to the death of a young Iranian woman who died in police custody after allegedly flouting strict Islamic dress codes. Austria's foreign minister says the package targets 11 Iranian people and four entities responsible for serious human rights violations. Last month, a deadly protest erupted in Iran in response to the woman's death. Mercedes is broadening its battery-powered lineup with the new sports utility vehicle. The aim is to take on Tesla's model why the kamikaze later stepped to go all electric by the end of the decade. The EQE SUV is a fourth model to use Mercedes-Dedicated EV platform. Now, we did speak to the CEO who says the energy crisis may hasten the move in renewables. Europe, in particular, will be challenged in the next two, maybe three years. And we're working on fixing that, especially Germany. It has been dependent on gas coming from Russia. So there's a lot of activity to deal with this short-to-midterm challenge. But if we go look a little bit longer, mid to long-term, I think this may even be a catalyst to go quicker into renewables.

What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation.

It's recycling and existing building, which as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians.

An ass thing stands today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps fought in August. Governor Bailey, TNCAP, the next decision from the Bank of England in early November, live from New York City this morning. Good morning. It's a price action for you when the S&P 500 elevated and kicking higher on the S&P, bouncing back again this morning by 1.29%. You'll turn in South low and negative nine basis points on a 10 year, 393, and sterling a 113-handle again cable. The pound against the US dollar, 113-04, positive by a little more than 1%. And I wouldn't just call this a U-turn. This goes beyond that, Tom Keane from the new chancellor, Mr Hunt. Over in London, making plans to reverse pretty much everything and shorten the energy support program from two years down to just through April 2023. The Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index for the United Kingdom, John, is absolutely original. It shows the buzzardness of the moment. And I think we've just got to dive into it. I'm going to do it on the political end with Guy Johnson joining us now in London because John's a lot, lot more up to speed on this than that I am. Guy, can you explain the politics here? Is the chance of the exchequer running for office? Yes. That's not a radio answer, Guy. We got to do better than that. It doesn't work on Bloomberg radio. He's running for office. They're all running for office. It is open season. Everybody is now running for office in the UK. Penny Morton's running for office. Rishi Sunak's running for office. Jeremy Hunt is running for office. It is open season on Liz Truss. The real problem here, Tom, and I'm being I'm joking with you because it is amazing to watch and I can't quite believe my eyes. But I find myself in a situation where I actually struggle to wonder whether or not they can make it stick though. Because here's the problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3871,2022-10-17 10:21:33
15526," I don't quite believe my eyes, but I find myself in a situation where I actually struggle to wonder whether or not they can make it stick though. Because here's the problem. Can you change leaders again without a general election? Can you credibly do that? And I think that is going to be a question that increasingly becomes relevant since the days progress. We have a relatively positive outcome from the markets this morning. That will buy Liz Truss, Jeremy Hunt, until the 31st. If things calm down beyond then, maybe this kind of atmosphere calms down. And actually there is a view taken that she can survive a little bit longer than that. We've got around two and a half years until the next general election. The Tory MPs are not going to want to bring that forward. If the chaos continues, yes, she's definitely gone. And that certainly looks like the base case at the moment. I wouldn't rule out her remaining either. I think Liz Truss is running for Prime Minister as well at the moment. Let's get to November 3rd. This bank of England, go through the policies that have just been announced. And walk us through what this is going to mean for Governor Bailey when he sits down with the team in a few weeks' time. Let's look at pricing this morning, John. The front-ends come down. Let's call it circuit 50 basis points. I've been talking to Venn Rom about this this morning from M. Live. We're basically back down to, let's call it, circa 100 bips for the next meeting. That's where we were pre-midi budgets. We've priced out quite a lot. The front-end basically has moved down in the year quite aggressively. But probably doesn't go any further. The market is still pricing a terminal rate of 5 to 5.5%, 6%. We've still got a long way to go on the front-end. This looks like a tactical rally here this morning. But the base case is still that the bank of England has to do a lot. It probably just isn't pricing the very aggressive move that potentially would have had to announce where this chaos to have had to continue. And we hadn't had basically a large reversal on the unfunded budget, John. So that is kind of where we are. I'm just looking at the Bloomberg now. Less than 175 bips of B.O.E. Heights now priced by year-end versus 2.80 only a few days ago. So that's the kind of the move we're seeing. But whether it goes any further, particularly at the front-end, looks doubtful at this kind of level at this stage, John. Guy, given the fact that you're talking about everyone under the sun running for office and that this is an open season, there is a question about the credibility of Jeremy Hunt at this point as he basically undoes everything that Liz Truss put out there as her platform. How much credibility is there in the markets and by other policy makers that this will stick, that this is truly going to be the policy going forward? I think this probably will stick, Lisa. And the reason for it sticking is the market reaction. The market, they're terrified of the markets down in Westminster once again. Westminster is terrified of the city. That is now what is happening. So you get a positive reaction. Probably is a tick in the box for this policy. He's maybe gone a little bit further than somehow anticipated in certain levels, in certain areas. And he is indicating that there are further painful cuts still to come. He has, it looks like he's going to shorten up the duration of the energy relief package. That's going to happen. We've already heard the announcements on corporation tax and some of the other taxes that were going to change. I would say that this is now looking like it is the policy. The policy of this sort of dash for growth that Quartan and Truss put forward has been completely reversed. We talked on Friday about the fact that we wanted the UK needed a more sensible approach. Given the market reaction that we saw before and afterwards, this new policy will be seen as the more sensible. Hey guy, looking forward to catching up a little bit later. Guy Johnson, out of London, on Chancellor Hunt's big U-turn and promising even more. I go back to that line from Kit Jukes, a sock chain from early this morning. The title of this morning, no. Goodbye, crisis, hello recession, the vigilantes win. The vigilantes, Tom King. This is so important. And it's not to cliche the edge of your denning, you know, the bond vigilantes. Sure. It's the equity bond currency and commodity vigilantes. And I'd really look off the messaging in Washington that I heard, particularly off Mike, at the currency vigilantes. What we're going to do about those available to swap lines and those that are not available. And you wonder where the United Kingdom fits in there. Are they President? The President of the United States went in on the situation in the UK as well, Tom. They've not been scared of doing that. Saying that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3872,2022-10-17 10:26:08
15527," And those that are not available, and you wonder where the United Kingdom fits in there. Are they president? The president of the United States went in on the situation in the UK as well, Tom. They've not been scared of doing that, saying that the the plan to cut taxes on the wealthy was not a good idea, and he wasn't the only person who said it was wrong. Yeah, I'll go with that. I just did some math here on the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index. And the United States, as a general statement back 20 years, is more restrictive right now than Governor Bailey. I don't know what to make of that. Can I just throw this in there on tax policy in the UK versus the US? The top bracket here, 37% for federal income tax. When you start paying that 540 in and around 540,000, do you know when you start to pay 40% in the UK? 50,000 sterling. 50,000 sterling. So you're still? I'm not sure the president of the United States is in the greatest position to talk about how much the wealthiest pay in taxes. It's a highly progressive tax code in the United States. And if something that's social democrats in the United States don't really communicate to the electorate very well, the European model is based on getting many more people to pay a lot more in taxes. Yes, not just the upper echelon, upper echelons of society. That's a major difference that it's just not discussed on this side of the Atlantic. I think it's true, and it's again the shift from my youth over to where we are now. And as you say, it's much more progressive, and of course the Trump tax cuts, whatever anybody thinks of the politics, they were popular. Ebrahim Raq Barri is going to join us very shortly on city and what you call them, the FX vigilantes. The FX, this is my major message from my mental world bank. The FX vigilantes are out there with a vengeance. Look at you in this morning, we haven't even talked about it. 148.67. The other thing the president said, Lisa, I'm not worried about the dollar, I'm worried about the rest of the world, but the rest of the world is worried about the dollar. Well, yeah, but the US isn't worried about the dollar as much, and they don't really care as much about the rest of the world. So, try to square that. I'm pretty confused by that. Features this morning on the S&P. Are you? Confused. By 1.2. I'm always confused. They got it done against the touches, didn't they? I saw that. I saw that. It was a good game. Real baseball. I don't think you could get in this nervous movement. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order.

15528," We're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. Live from New York City this morning, good morning, getting about this Monday morning on the S&P 500. Here's the price action for you when the S&P elevated futures pushing higher on the S&P and on the NASDAQ 2 by 1.35% on the NASDAQ 100 on the S&P 500 up by 1.2%. Snapshot of the treasury market for you, 2's, 10's and 30's, yield lower by 8 basis points on a 10 year, 393.85 through 450 on a 2 year last week. What a move that was. We backtracked with that 5 or 6 basis points, the 44390 on the week last week, 2 year yield climbing for 6 straight weeks, your 10 year yield climbing for maybe even 11. Can you get your head around that 11 weeks? No, 11 weeks. No, I can't get my head around this and Lisa help me here quickly with the mortgage. 30 year mortgage rate, I can't get my head around it. 6.9% I think of the average and it comes because you are seeing this expectation. Jim Bullard, we haven't mentioned this yet. Over the weekend, was talking about the likelihood of a 4.75% Fed funds rate by the end of this year. That he sees that as a possibility. That is a game changer for someone who really has been out front. So the conversation he teed up, which was interesting is that you use the December's decision to bring in what you want to do in 23. Agreed. Perhaps into December. We'll see. We've got a lot of data between now and then. Got a lot of headlines to throw into the UK market for you as well. Look at guilt. Look at sterling. Yields come down by 38 basis points on a UK 30 year. Down 36 on a UK 10 year. These are truly historic moves in the guilt market off the back of a couple of headlines from the chancellor. Several. The backtracking on pretty much all of the tax cut plans. The support they were going to offer individuals for offsetting some of the pain in the energy market. They're going to tighten up the duration of that support as well. And ultimately, Tom, what they're communicating is there's more to come. There's more to come. Absolutely. The standard deviation study was at agonizing seven standard deviation. And we're now down to about 2.5 standard deviation still. Tension there, but nothing like what we saw. The research piece of the weekend and foreign exchange, Ibrahim Robari, wrote it. He is global head of FX analysis. It's a city group with thrilled. He could join us after his attendance in Washington. Ibrahim, what I noticed in Washington is little focus on central banks and maximum focus on dollar liquidity among the flush countries and the ones more challenged. How critical is a dollar shortage worldwide? Well, I would say the dollar was the talk of the town in Washington, but the message that we came away with was actually a little bit different. We did come away with thinking the Fed is still the central focus. And when it comes to the dollar, there's a lot of concern. But really the sense that isn't very much that could be done about it unless the Fed was going to veer off its unique focus on inflation at present. And when it comes to the dollar,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3874,2022-10-17 10:34:38
15529," of concern, but really the sense that isn't very much that could be done about it unless the Fed was going to veer off its unique focus on inflation at present. And when it comes to foreign exchange markets, as much of a concern as they are, right now they seem to be operating in a relatively orderly way. So yes, FX funding markets have started to show some signs of concern, but we're not nearly at a point where policy interventions are likely to be imminent. I've got to go to the immediate, everyone. What is the what is the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance do in Japan with their unique experience? What is the reality of a second interventions efficacy after a failed first intervention? Well, we expect more of the same. So we think that second intervention is going to come likely very soon, copy as early as today, and we saw the rhetoric ramp up late on Friday. And at the same time, we got Governor Corota reassert that Japan was different, that more monetary easing was required to bring inflation back up. So we see no reason for the efficacy to change in the Japanese case. And therefore, we do think that just as in the first case, dollar yen would come down once you see those signs of intervention, and then it would creep right back up as you as rates go back up. Well, Ibrahim, some people say it sort of failed intervention the first time around. Their goal was simply to slow the pace of the depreciation of the yen versus the dollar. If that's the case, where is the new red line in the sand? This idea of when they will get really concerned and have to rethink, oh, host of issues, is it 150? Is it 160? Is it 180? So I have sympathy with that statement. So we think there is no clearly defined red line, but if there is one, it's probably defined by politics or when inflation starts to credibly be above 2%. And that is certainly north of 160 on that letter criterion. We don't think the politics would probably become acute before then. So it's quite a long way away from here. And until then, Ibrahim is a Kishida in New York said himself that it was dollar yen moving 30 handles in a year, two handles in a day that was raising this concern. So it was about the pace of appreciation in dollar yen, not the level. So we don't see a line in the sand anywhere close to the current. So perhaps that's the future crisis. The current crisis, or perhaps it's been somewhat averted as in the United Kingdom, where we're going to be hearing from Jeremy Haunt a couple of times throughout the day, trying to stave off some of the pain that we saw over the past few weeks of volatility. How much credence do you give to this idea of foreign investors coming back to the UK at a time when the bond vigilantes, if they won, that means a sooner and potentially deeper recession? So we think the bar for foreign investors to return to the UK on mass is very high. And at the heart of that, I would quote what we think are probably the two most relevant statistics, an 8% current account deficit, which I think reflects some of the broader challenges the UK is facing. And real interest rates that are still just about negative and certainly 1 to 2% below those in the US. So I think if that kind of environment, the bar for foreign investors to see major appealing the UK is incredibly high. There was something Ibrahim Batak to Rogman Rajan, a boost school, the former leader of the Indian Central Bank, about the flow realities of emerging markets. Is it like the 90s for emerging markets right now? Well, I would say there is a lot of optimism, maybe a touch of complacency when it comes to the large emerging markets present. And if you take for an exchange at an example, the appreciation of the dollar has been much more extensive against the developed markets than it's been against emerging markets. So at present, we see more concern about frontier markets, a lot less about the emerging markets. But one of the issues I'm concerned with is that that could change that maybe there is a bit too much complacency that the large emerging markets are in a better position on the balance sheet side economically to something even for inflation. So we're concerned, but the base case is that maybe we have to watch some of the developed markets like the UK a bit more closely than the UK. There's all this macro babble, Ibrahim. Where's a trade I can make money on in the Q4? I mean, forget about the IMF, 60,000 feet stuff. Where could I make some money in the next 90 days? So we think it's more of the same. So that that perhaps",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3875,2022-10-17 10:39:01
15530," IMF 60,000 feet stuff. Where could I make some money in the next 90 days? So we think it's more of the same. So that pattern of higher global interest rates, lower equity prices and the stronger dollar, we think will continue into year end and there are these balancing pressures that make that even more likely. So in foreign exchange, we see further dollar upside against, in particular, the risky foreign currencies. So for example, continue to be short, the Australian dollar against the US dollar, we think has promised into the end of the year. Just to be clear to elaborate a little bit on that point, is the faith in a stronger dollar from here predicated on this idea that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates close to 5% by early next year or is it predicated on the idea that the economic data coming in will continue to be strong. And that is the reason for these rate hikes that really it's the resilience of the economy rather than the rate hikes themselves. The two are related, but I would put more weight on on the Fed and those rate hikes. And that is because they do reflect to some degree the economic up-forms of the US. But the central driver of dollar strength has been the decline in asset prices around the world. And for that, Fed interest rates in US real rates are the primary driver. So both matter, but it is more about the Fed right now than about US growth. Hey Abraham, always wonderful to hear from you sir. You be here, Mark Barry there. F.C.C. The range that we've had on Sterling on cable over the last few weeks has just been phenomenal. 103.50 at the lows on cable. That was back on September 25th. And this morning, Tom, briefly back through 113 right now, 112.70. Yeah, and again, that frames it out that we're not back. I haven't done study of where it breaks out. 118.120. I don't know where it is, but we're nowhere near that word reversal. And I think that's evident across every feature of this debate. Let's see what we get from the Bank of England and Governor Bayley a little bit later in November. November 3rd. There was talk of 100 basis points 125 with this budget. Does he have to go as far as fast as people thought he did just weeks ago? The market is saying no. The market right now is pricing in a slower pace of rate hikes. But Andrew Bayley has underwhelmed the market. It's several consecutive bank of England meetings in terms of how far he went. And will he have to do better than that this time around? Because you could say that we staved off. We got a cap on how high yields could go or how low or a floor for how low the pound could go. Still though, as you point out, the levels are a far cry for what they were just weeks ago. And the risk premium built in for some of the uncertainty as you pointed out yesterday is going to be something that stays around for a bit. How do you put a scars in sterling assets? There's one dimension, one aspect of this announcement from the Chancellor that jumps out to me that I think at some point we'll have to revisit. In fact, we know we will. 8 April 2023 is when the support for the energy situation will end. And I wonder if you have to revisit again that Tom. Yeah, that's just a really important point is this a single winter issue. Exactly. And you've been good on this. Am I right, John? That in a lot of Europe, they're already looking at as a two winter. Well, the original plan was a couple of years. So we were already planning for say two years of this. But London's really not doing that. Not now. They reversed that plan. And in Europe, I think we're all starting to have that conversation a much bigger way. Not one winter may be several. And the problem is is that how much investment could happen if the bond vigilantes are back. And I keep going back to this and it's about Europe, but it's also the US. We're suddenly as we have 22 days to the midterm elections, social security and Medicare spending is a massive issue because where do you get the money to spend on some of these issues, whether it's energy or anything else at a time when the cost of financing is so high? I can't think of the last time this happened. Tom, I'm thinking back maybe to the Eurozone crisis and pushing out Bill Estonia and Italy when the market basically forced the government to push people out and do something this bigger than a G7 economy. Again, the sea change shares are getting back to a risk free rate. We're getting back to the G and gravity as Teleb talks about. And this is when you have that, John. I mean, it's like Italy or it's like that. Can I talk about another restructuring? This is where we're going to talk about it later. Sri Nader Rajin to join us in the eight o'clock hour. Goldman Sachs is on the edge of trust. Solomon is like doing a Liz Truss. You just be a little action.

Although the radar, and you know, Shrinath Arajan is saying this should be above the radar. Is the Goldman Sachs consumer bank a failure? Marcus, Marcus? You can call it that if you want to.

Futures right now. At 1% on ESMP, we're bouncing back from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word news, I'm Leanne Gerens. Newly appointed UK Chancellor of the Czech Republic, Jeremy Hans set out plans to try to bring order to the UK's public finances and reassure markets after Liz Truss's economic program triggered weeks of turmoil. He announced a further rollback on some of the tax cuts planned by Truss and a shortening of a planned universal energy support. No government can control markets, but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances. And that is one of the many factors that influence how markets behave. And for that reason, although the Prime Minister and I are both committed to cutting corporation tax, on Friday she listened to concerns about the mini budget and confirmed we will not proceed with the cut to corporation tax announced. Meanwhile, hand will address Parliament with more details later. Now China told its state-owned gas importers to stop selling LNG to energy starved buyers in Europe and Asia in order to ensure its own supply for the winter heating season.

Perhaps by another 75 basis points. These banks make money from these rate hikes. Should not be back to you. Should not be back for America. Moments ago you see the same thing we've seen at the other banks. You see a rise in that interest income above expectations. But you do see provisions for loan losses higher by about 150 million or so. More than Wall Street had expected. Very clean numbers here. They have clean trading figures relative to Wall Street's expectations. Met on a beat on thick. Met on equities reported zero days of trading losses. That says value at risk is broadly rising across the industry. Keeping expenses broadly in line. Let's see how Wall Street continues to react. They got a little jump in their shares on Friday. After JP Morgan reported. Are these numbers enough to keep Wall Street happy? We are seeing about a 2.4% game premarket trading from Bank of America. From your perspective. What's the most notable aspect here? We talk about loan loss provisions not that much higher than what they had expected. And they really actually blew it out when it came to equity trading as well. Which was unusual for the other banks. Yeah, it is unusual. And then you look at what is going wrong and thick. I would also say because the question is roll forward. How much of a overhang will that be there? Starting to see some cracks in credit and mortgages. We've been talking about this. Is that going to start to hurt in future quarters? Really quickly here also charge offs from the prior quarter declined. So help the consumer. Very quickly in their great PowerPoint. They get the best in class PowerPoint and the stuff in consumer banking. They have 44% more zeal transactions than written checks. I know. You haven't written a check in 10 years. I'm still writing 10 a day. Digital banking is the win here for these banks. It is the win and it's also very political because are they keeping that branch head count alive as they grow digitally? They're being accessed by lawmakers. And again, Jamie Dheimen answered the question Friday. Are they going to increase those savings rates for consumers as they go along? This is a huge issue. Sean Ali, thank you so much. And we're going to speak now with one of the experts here on your future of banking and this dovetails into JPMorgan and Bank of America. Thomas Michaud is chief executive officer of KBW. Keep for it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3878,2022-10-17 10:52:18
15533," one of the experts here on your future of banking and this dovetails into JP Morgan and Bank of America. Thomas Michaud is chief executive officer of KBW, Keith Friet and Woods, of course, was Steffel and is absolutely definitive on the pulse of American banking. Small, mid-super regional, super, super machoed in the big banks as well. Thomas showed when did they capitulate and realize the future is digital banking? Well, that's happening right now, right in front of us. I think what was remarkable during the COVID period was how much digital engagement there was. And we've been watching very carefully to see if it would slip back after COVID came to it. Thankfully, came to an end. That hasn't happened. Digital engagement's up. That's going to, we think it's going to be good for consumers. It's going to take friction out as well as the fact that it's going to help with expenses, with these big banks and make them profitable. Time, I know you're not involved in the Kroger Albertsons deal. Maybe it's a little bit outside your remit. But there we are with finally a new risk-free rate. Finally, we've got the math back to what it was. Are there zombie banks to be merged? We think consolidation will restart. Historically speaking, when things are disorderedly, is when consolidation and banking slows down. Stock prices have been very volatile. A lot of concern about the economy. My expectation is as soon as things settle down and get orderly again, we're going to see consolidation happen because scale is working in the banking industry. And a lot of it is what you talked about earlier, revolving around the ability to invest in technology. And that's one of the themes in this industry. Tom, Tom Keane mentioned this whole question of consolidation and mergers and acquisitions. And I wonder about some of the debt, the financing, force of these acquisitions that were arranged earlier this year, the banks are still hanging on to. How concerned are you based on the increase in low-moss provisions in the sense that perhaps it's not all in there about this being a potential risk in the future? The reality is that asset marks, which is what you're talking about, which is one of the valuations of commitments that were made a while ago. Asset marks have been negative for the banking industries. They've been really across the board in finance. And so we would expect that there would be negative marks to things like that, as well as frankly to bond holdings that's been happening. Really one of the themes. That's why we think during this Bank America conference call that's coming up, there's going to be a lot of talk about tangible capital and other capital ratios. And frankly, Bank America is our expectation they were going to improve their capital ratios and being a very strong position. So the reason why these banks have been caring as much capital as they have so they can withstand easily things like you just asked about loan marks. So we would expect there will be negative loan marks, but we also believe that the banking industry is well capitalized and can handle it. Tom Brighton, we're seeing shares of Bank America above a 3% in pre-market trading. Who do you think is going to be the winner and who do you think is going to be the loser of this earnings season? The banks that have a lot of net interest income, it's almost like a continuum. If you've got a big investment banking operation, you're under pressure just so you know, our analysts are looking for down 55% in total across the board, investment banking revenues for the third quarter, but only down 2% link quarter. So it suggests to us the year over year pain is real. However, we think we're bouncing along a new level. You're a regional bank, if you're one of the big superregions, they're in the second quarter we believe of a four quarter run where they're going to show 20% year over year net interest income growth. That really has not happened in my career. And so it is very, very strong on the revenue side. Hey, Tom, what a foot of hair from you, sir. It's good to catch up. Tom and show the FKBW the stock up by 3.5%. What we see in TK from the banks in the last couple of days is the benefits from higher interest rates. What you're arguably going to see in the coming quarters is the harm done by higher interest rates when the economy starts to work out. It's often a whole lot more. We're going to see that. And Bloomberg has a real heritage here of looking at thick and looking at banking and all that. I'm looking at what you and I talked to Moynihan about in Davos, which is the grinding grind of consumer banking. And as Michaud just said here, I'm looking at double digit long growth, double digit this, double digit that. And the rev.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3879,2022-10-17 10:56:32
15534," of consumer banking and as Micheal just said here, I'm looking at double digit long growth, double digit this, double digit that. On the revenue side and the grinding consumer side, this is a constructive story. That's great because you get to pass on higher interest rates for businesses to zoom alone, to spend time here. Well, somehow we'll survive in a passing now on to the deposit base, brilliant news. But what we start to see crack in the last week or so, and Chanel, you can speak to this, auto-loan origination, mortgage origination. That's the side of things where you can start to see things punching the other way. They sure do, and I also took a quick look at the presentation. You see credit card delinquency, 30 days overdue, taking higher as well. And the credit card business is really where you're seeing a lot of these banks punch a lot higher in the net interest income and the loans that they're making there. This is what's interesting about this moment, Tom. The banks are telling you kind of what we already knew. The economy's okay. In the third quarter, it was all right, but we're preparing because we think in the next quarter it's going to get worse. We didn't go to Micheal down this though, but with the Goldman Sachs restructuring, and not a Rajan wrote about it today, you wonder about traditional banking, more of a Goldman Sachsie kind of economy, is how much is the restructuring going to be in the net? Can you tell me what a Goldman Sachsie kind of economy is? Lack of consumer banking. I mean, they did, Chanel, is Marcus a failed proposition? Listen, so much of this was about lowering Goldman's cost to funding and diversifying Goldman Sachs, but 60 to 70% still comes from IB and trading. What are you going to do? Tom wants to know if Marcus is a failure. That's all he wants to know. Chanel, he's not going to go on the record, Tom Italian. Absolutely. It's not happening. No, no, no, no. Steve Chevrolet and the next hour, a federated Hermes, Steve might go there TK. Futures on ESMP 500, at more than 1% alive from New York. This is Blaineberg. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals. And we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands. And then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal.

15535,". Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get online. Well, I just got that. Bloomberg Television. Top Experts, great questions. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryoth's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg.

BEEPING BEEPING BEEPING BEEPING BEEPING BEEPING BEEPING Under the circumstances, in fact, it's going to keep continued to raise its aggressively till they see the need to go down. The Fed is going to continue to be on this path for quite a few months. I definitely think we'll see another 75-based point move in November. The more aggressive they get, the more you're going to bring recession fear as the primary fear over inflation. Because of the Fed overdoing this, we're going to end up back where we were 10 years ago. This is Bloomberg's Evalence with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City this morning, good morning, good morning, from our audience worldwide on TV and radio. This is Bloomberg's surveillance alongside Tom Keane. At least Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow, features out by more than 1%. T-Calf got to say, actually a pretty interesting session already this morning, particularly in foreign exchange. Yeah, I thought we picked up right off the last number of weeks where you have to look at the equities, bonds, currencies, commodities, but the holistic haul. And the, you're right, foreign exchange is the litmus paper that we've got. Front and center is a yen running away, 148.85. All you need to know if you don't keep scoring yen is that it's troubling for the leadership of Japan. Inch in closer and closer to 150, I can tell you, starting breaking out a little bit earlier this morning as well, cable, the Pan against the US dollar, 1279, call it 1280, Lisa, briefly, or 113. Basically the market is one and the power of the market right now. Who was it who said if they come back, they want to come back as the bond market after they die? Mr. Carville. Mr. Carville, how much is that what we're seeing right now? And how far can that go? Is it just United Kingdom or does this go further at a time when suddenly there is a rate that people have to pay to borrow money? So you've got the U-turn from the chancellor on a range of tax cuts. He's also done something on energy. He shortened the duration of the support that he will offer to the UK consumer. Have you a blast sad on Twitter? Moment ago, bringing up a really important point on this. And I think this is going to get a lot more attention. UK government has admitted in Havio's opinion. It does not have the money to subsidize energy consumption for everyone beyond six months. From April 23, onward, many voters will fill the pain of high gas and electricity prices. He goes on to say, Tom, it may be local politics, but it has implications for Ukraine. Yeah, I'll go with that. And what really upsets me here is X China, where there's clearly a slowdown, witnessed the GDP pause. Where would Brent crude be now if you had legitimate Asian demand? And the answer is the UK at 110. On a different planet. On a different planet. Coincidental? That you think that they have the big meeting over in China and the third quarter GDP number is just delayed. No, I don't think that that was a long grasp. Exactly. And basically people are expecting, in general, the economy to come in with the slowest pace. One of the slowest pace is ever 3.3% as the economist view for growth. The first time I ever heard this was from Ellarian. 3% GDP is a global recession. We're there. Two handle. We're talking about two's, Tom. Yeah. Now for 2020. I didn't know that. Excuse me. I've been down at Martin's to Evan and George. You weren't listening to what they had to say on the forecast. I bet you were. I bet you were. Future's right now on ESMP 500. Spiked French onions. So from sure that's delicious. It's best in Washington. What's there? What? Mods.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3881,2022-10-17 11:05:33
15536," I bet he were features right now on ESMP 500 spiked French onions so from sure that's delicious. It's best in Washington. What's there? More than 1% on ESMP 500 yields lower by 7 basis points. 394.46 talked a lot about the 10 year climbing for the 11 consecutive weeks. I'm still not used to those yields. I look at them on the screen and it's like from another year. To see the price. In the two year through 450 last week. Just up up on a way, Brammo. I mean, honestly, and this again goes to this question of is Jim Bullard really the new T-leaf on the Fed saying that 4.75% could be the Fed funds rate as of the end of this year. We get more from Jeremy Hunt, the UK's new chancellor of the ESC's checker. He has already released his statement earlier, but he is going to speak with the House of Commons at 10 30 a.m. Eastern. How much more clarity do we get on some of these plans? Like what kind of triggers there could be to extend some of this aid and how much this is more prevalent? How much are they going to cut spending right now? We are seeing 30 year yields in the UK come down. You are seeing the pound strengthen, but really going forward. How much can you get strengthening in the pound when you are kind of guaranteeing a recession? And now potentially a deep one if you don't have fiscal spending as a relief valve. We did get Bank of America earnings. We get the earnings call at about 8 30 a.m. How much can they speak to the forward look in terms of what kinds of credit cracks, what kinds of problems with the link with these? That their threshold will be for lending at a time when possibly consumers will not have as much to repay their loans. And at 8 30 a.m. we get U.S. empire manufacturing going back to where are we in this cycle? People are expecting some sort of material slow down in manufacturing that it was the front of the inflation in the boom. Will it be in the front of the other side? What happens if it's not because we have seen John so many economic surprises to the upside which really has been treated as bad news for a market concerned about a Fed? Alisa thank you Brian Moynihan over at Bank of America on the economy seeing a resilient consumer with cash to spare. The one thing that's jumped out for all of us I think over the last couple of days Tom pouring for the bank numbers, the provision for credit losses. So that's $898 million over at BFA for the third quarter. The estimate was 76.1. I think they direction to travel here Tom Townsend story. It's there and it's always there when you have some form of slow down in GDP and we've got that slow down in place. I think there is a caution or even a Bramble gloom element to the bank financial story. But the other side is the efficiency they're getting from digital banking and as Michaud said earlier, Thomas showed of KBW a Steeple company. As Thomas showed said as well. Is that a vertical company these days? I don't know. It's like Bloomberg surveillance. A federal company. I think might might might take issue with that. Steve Chevrolet joins us now. Had a multi asset solutions at federated Hermes. Steve, we've had some earnings over the last couple of weeks. I love your response to them. What takes you right? What catches you right? Yeah, look, I think you guys are touching on it. It's a consumer that's still relatively strong, but with risk ahead on the credit side and I think that's what we're seeing. This cycle is being defined not by its severity but by its duration. And what you're seeing is that despite credit card balances being very high, despite consumers having eaten and to savings despite wealth having been destroyed, consumers really still aren't worried about losing their jobs. And so they're still hanging in there. And this is all taking longer to play out. I think they will crack. But I think those cracks are to come in 23, not necessarily right here now. Steve Chevrolet, you don't remember the zombies that one Stephen Roth does is I do great, great singles from the 60s as well. Let's talk about Stephen Roth and the zombie companies right now. Are the zombie companies going to roll up with this new rate regime? I think you're certainly going to have a lot of pressure on it because what we've seen and I think what the UK has tested and shown is that the old system of simulating your way out of any kind of recession or financial market pain isn't being allowed. The inflation is holding you at bay there. And so you're in this scenario where you're going to have a slow down, you're going to have pressure, you're going to have credit cracks and the federal government, central banks can't come to the rescue as quickly or as easily as they have had historically. That's why this is a long drawn out multi quarter economic doubt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3882,2022-10-17 11:09:28
15537," The federal government, central banks can't come to the rescue as quickly or as easily as they have had historically. That's why this is a, I think, a long drawn out multi-quarter economic downturn. Not something that's going to reverse quickly. I was reading through your note, Steve, and I pictured a big mattress that was stuffed full of dollar bills, and that was the entirety of it. Is that really what you're doing or is there sort of a more nuanced approach? No, it's much more nuanced than that, right? You don't want it. You certainly don't want to put your cash under the mattress. You want invested cash. Now, I'm not endorsing Tom's triple-levard cash fund. Let's be clear. But, you know, prime money market strategies. You can go out a little bit further on the curve. You know, that three to six month part of the curve. You want to have liquidity within your cash portfolio. You want to be able to take that money and move it out to a longer duration fixed income when the time comes. And we think that time is approaching, though it's not here yet. But you know, you can get pretty darn compelling yields as you go in to kind of cash. You know, you're a three and a quarter on a prime cash strategy. And I think you're going to be over four within two weeks. That's not a bad place to wait. And then we think you'll be able to deploy that in the not too distant future with some compelling opportunities. But yeah, cash is king right now. Steve, you talked about going further out along the curve. You said, now's not the time when the time comes. What me through the process you go through that guides that decision? What do you look at? Yeah, there's a lot going on. There's a game of chicken going on right now. The biggest risk of the financial markets are rising yields. And what you've seen is that the U turn or the initial U turn in the UK has had mixed results. And so I think the Fed is trying to hike and crack the economy. Get the unemployment up, get the growth down, and then allow bond yields to ride to fall. On the back of that, as recession overtakes inflation as the key concern, but that hasn't happened yet. What's happening is with each hot inflation report, the terminal rate goes up just as rates do. And the whole thing moves up. Yeah, bond yields continue to move higher. That's the dynamic that needs to stop. You need to see inflation stop rising for a minute, at least on the core readings. And what we're concerned about is with services moving up. If you get any move higher in energy prices, a $92 average WTI price in December. And you could very well have a new headline in inflation in the US. And that's I don't want to be buying a long duration in front of that. I see a state. What if it's a hair from your Steve chevron that a federated Tom to Steve's point. It's not just that inflation keeps coming in hot is that the output, the economic numbers keep coming in Brazilian. And this Fed to Steve's point, you price in a high terminal rate. And the whole curve just shifts. It's not like to shut up and tell you to manage the whole curve up. Yeah, this is a really important distinction of a shift versus the dynamics that are out there. This was discussed a little bit in IMF and the basic feelers from Stanley Fisher's ultra accommodative to a accommodative to some form of John Williams neutrality. I'm going all our start on you. I'm trying to dazzle you. Thanks that I appreciate that. But are we near restriction and I don't hear anybody say we are. You know, again, we play things you never want to say. This is something you never want to say as a spokesperson for a government. Liz Truss isn't resigning as prime minister. When you have to come out and say that as a spokesperson for a government, Tom, just speak to the moment that the UK is in. Yeah, it is as well. And I got to be careful here, but somebody was out measuring the duration of trust versus the White House duration of our good friend Mr. Scaramucci. I saw that too. Too scared of moochies. Too scared of moochies. Too scared of moochies. Too scared of moochies. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. I'm going to say that. Too scared of moochies. Too scared of moochies. I had it the chance to get on. Bruto. Bruto, we're here from this chance to again. We're here from this chance to again a little bit later on this morning over the UK. I'm sure we'll take some of that footage for you. But ultimately at the end of this month, we'll also hear from him in a detailed way when he unveils, announces more UK measures, Tom. That headline crossed into. There is more to come. So you think there's some substance here at 1030 this morning New York. I think we need to work out what the more is and it sounds like spending cuts and this market here's spending cuts and a reverse the tax policy and actual, a normal spending cuts. We'll see.

This is Bloomberg Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word news I'm Leanne Gerrins here in the UK. The newly appointed challenger Jeremy Hunt has set out plans to try to bring order to the public Finances and reassure markets that's after Liz Truss's economic program triggered weeks of market turmoil. He announced a further rollback on some of the tax cuts planned by the Prime Minister and a shortening of planned universal energy support. It is a deeply held conservative value. A value that I share that people should keep more of the money they earn. But at a time when markets are rightly demanding commitment to sustainable public finances it is not right to borrow to fund this tax cut. Meanwhile, Hunt will address Parliament later with more details. European Union nations have agreed to a new package of sanctions on Iran over human rights violations related to the death of a young Iranian woman who died in police custody after allegedly flouting strict Islamic and dress codes. As foreign minister says the package targets 11 Iranian people and four entities responsible for serious human rights violations. Ministers are also discussing reports about Iran's military support for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake. I'm Leanne Gerons. This is Bloomberg. Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today Apple pushes ads in three places. The App Store, Apple News and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snap and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple is hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

When US inflation numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. Thanks for joining us, thanks for learning. remain extremely confident about the UK's long-term economic prospects as we deliver our mission to go for growth. But growth requires confidence and stability, and the United Kingdom will always pay its way. This government will therefore take whatever tough decisions are necessary to do so. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Jeremy Hunt, out of the UK just in the last hour, you know we played that game about filing things you never want to have to say. I think you can file that one in that particular category for this Chancellor. The UK will always pay its way. Tom, things you never really want to have to say to the market and guilt responding, you're to lower, you're much lower. There's a complexity here. We're going to go to Lizzie here, which is going to help out as we want to Guy Johnson earlier. To me, John, the major parsing here of a given budget for any nation any time is when you say budget cuts, are they inflation-adjusted budget cuts? Real budget cuts, are they outright nominal budget cuts or a combination of the two spread out among different programs? We're going to have a lot of nominal and real discussion here. We'll get more detail ultimately at the end of this month. The one that sticks out for me, and I keep going back to this, that I mention of all of this that jumps out to me, is the support to offset the pain that comes from higher energy prices. And the fact that that's now been cut down from a couple of years just through April 2023, they might revisit it. Tom, they might have to extend it. Maybe for this market, they thought it was too much too soon all at once. No, come back in April and see how things look. But this is going to be more than one winter issue for many people. Okay, but what's the housing overlay here? Is it we're having a housing discussion in America as well as one part of that CPI? The pain's coming without a doubt. In the United Kingdom. The Bank of America. The Bank of America is still going to put rates up in early November, on November 3rd. Maybe by 75, not for me to say, to your point, Lisa, we thought the Bank of America would do X and the Governor often does Y. So I'll save that debate for another day. But yeah, it's getting more expensive, Tom, to serve us a mortgage without a doubt. And I look at the unrest here. I mean, are there protests in the United Kingdom, John, like we see protests in France this morning? Well, I don't live there, Tom. So I haven't come on. You're all wired up. I mean, come on. You're wired up from there to everything. The same way you are. You've been spelled correctly, unlike the New York City. You've got more subscriptions to British papers than I have. I do. I read the news states when it covered a cover. And what did you learn this week? I learned that their articles are so damn long, they're unreadable. Like the New Yorker. Oh no, way longer than that. Longer than that. The New New Yorker. They're like the older. I can't get through the New Yorker. Yeah, I'm just too much. I'm the same way. It's too much. Should we go to Lizzie? I think you should do that. Lizzie, burdened and London right now. She is wired into what we're going to see at 10th.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3885,2022-10-17 11:22:16
15540," I can't get through the New York. I'm just too much. I'm the same way. It's too much. Should we go to Lizzie? I think you should do that. Lizzie burdened in London right now. She is wired into what we're going to see at 103720 Wall Street time. Let's call it three hours. Lizzie, what are we going to hear from the chancellor of the ex-checker? Well, Tom, you were asking if there are protesters in the UK. I don't know if you can hear the guy over behind the camera and trying to get his music played in the US. But what are we expecting? We're expecting more detail on this absolute shredding of trust's economic policy, which is ironic because when I was at Downing Street earlier today, there was a shredding company's ban arriving there. And it's really in Tata's trust andomics at the moment. There's all of the reversals on the tax cuts. But as John hinted at, perhaps as humiliating is this rowing back on the energy bailout because all the way through when trust is having to do the U-turns on the top rate of income tax, corporation tax, trust continually taunted labour that her energy bailout was bigger than Kierstarmers. But now, Jeremy Hunt is admitting that in order to make the books balanced, they're going to have to make it more targeted support. It was a huge criticism of the bailout that people who didn't need money were getting it. But really, the hope will be that this will calm the markets a bit balanced the book. So we have to pay royalties to the Benny Hill estate. Is that what they're doing? I believe so. Very good. Is this our... This is our soundtrack now on Bloomberg's survey. You've got a few, you know. Lizzie, this probably works for the whole conversation on this program, David. I'm not sure if the new book is a little bit... Lisa, all remember. Go on, Lizzie. When Lisa and I were on the day of the mini budget, he was playing money, money, money, because that day it really was a rich man's world. Lizzie, let's get to late October, early November. And tell me what more we can expect from this chance, like the end of this month, and what it means for this governor at the start and next month. Well, he needs to balance the books. And this pack, what he's announced so far is expected to save £32 billion. But in terms of the black hole that is left, the OBR was projecting a medium-term fiscal hole of £70 billion, so it still leaves £38 to get debt falling as a share of GDP in three years. What you might also see is a rowing back on some of the supply side reforms that were really, really controversial, the other side of Trussonomics that just aren't likely to get past the parliamentary party. And when you get to that stage, you have MPs asking what is the point now of having Liz Truss at number 10? At all. The question, the answer when I'm speaking to MPs and Westminster is very much a question of when, not if she's going to go. Lizzie, I got to say that the music really adds to this feeling that we were talking about on Friday that it feels rather circus-like. In terms of the whole upheaval, is there any chance that Liz Truss keeps her job? Is there anything that she's doing now, especially as she sees some control and, frankly, the home to Jeremy Hunt, to really paint an agenda that's a lot different than what she had initially put out there? Jeremy Hunt is her only hope now, which is ironic, given he doesn't have treasury experience, he doesn't have broad support in the party. Remember, he's already had two failed leadership bids. But as you say, he's in the driver's seat, which is why lots of MPs are questioning whether they should just crown him as Prime Minister. But that would mean either another leadership election or bypassing the party membership, which would be ugly in either case. If there's a new leader, the mandate would be severely diluted. That would add to pressure for a staff election. And if you look at the polls at the moment, Labour would completely wipe out the Tory party. Lizzie, enjoy the music. Wondering it. And find out if we need to pay anyone. Lizzie Burden, thank you. Mr Stolfe is over at Oppenheimer. He has thrown the towel in. Here's the quote from him and the team. We are updating our year end price target for the S&P 500 based on the index is closing the level of 3583 last Friday. We now see just under 12% potential upside in the index by year end to establish a target of 4,000",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3886,2022-10-17 11:26:46
15541," Exist closing level of 3583 last Friday. We now see just under 12% potential upside in the index by year end to establish a target of 4000. I think you all remember the previous target. I'm trying to bring it up right now. I believe it was something like 5,300 at one point from Mr. Stolfus and Tom, that is gone. This is the issue and he's a grizzled pro and he's been dead on in the great, great bull market. But if you put a level in a time on it, you get in trouble. So I would suggest we haven't spoken to him yet, but I would suggest he's extending out his optimistic view. The last target we saw from John was 4800 and that's now down to four. Yeah, because the calendar is moving on here and tomorrow. Who's left? Oh, I don't know. Just to give up on this thing. One person, I don't know. Merkel Klenner, I thought he kind of gave up and said there's a risk now you achieve that and fit in 2023. He pushed out, but he didn't abandon the call. OK, so what do you do now? I'd love to know. I'd love to sort someone on the south side. It's got no problem with getting it wrong. No, no, people get it wrong sometimes. Would you just hold on to it for a couple of months? You'd stand your time. We'll just say next year. X axis, X axis, X axis, X axis. My question is how much can you really extend out when you have a fed that has to move more aggressively? Sure. I do not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fit or faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating. The way training is going, completely changing the way recovery is going. I think the sky is a limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

15542," Every time you're chasing the latest greatest newest tool, you're probably chasing a maraud. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen Bloomberg. I've seen Bloomberg. I've seen Bloomberg. I've seen Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. It's a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get all night. Well, yeah. Bloomberg Television. Top Experts. Great questions. Live from New York City this morning, good morning. Coming off the back of a week of losses on ESMP 500 just about after an ugly close last week on Friday. Bouncing back this morning, it features up by about 1.2% on ESMP on the NAS and that cut by 1.4. How bad are the bond market? 2s, 10s and 30s yields come in. They drop away after kicking out. Higher, much, much higher over the last six weeks on a two year through 450 briefly last week. On a 10-year yield climbing for 11 consecutive weeks. You're 10 year right now. 394.67 having a little look at a four-handler couple of times out of the last week and then back in a way. The bond market in the UK all over the place. We can take a look at GILT's 10s and 30s. Remember the 30-year plus is where that GILT market operation was taking place. Well, that GILT market is happed out by this chance of this morning. GILT aggressively lower off the back of a reversal on tax cuts and even back in a way on the duration of support they will offer to consumers in the UK around the energy crisis. And I think we can call it that. It will now go to April 2023. It was initially slated to last two years. Will they have to backtrack on that or revisit it later on? But ultimately, TK, from the chance to, I think, is pretty clear the direction to travel here from this particular individual. And it's very, very different to chance the Quanta. And it's about accommodation and restriction and the course of Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index for the United Kingdom showing a new restriction. John Moments ago in the United States, the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index shows new record restriction except for that COVID moment. And Tom, that's the goal. It's the objective. Yes, absolutely. To get it there, keep it there and wait for inflation to come down. Yep. And the problem they've got as a committee right now and it's no good me sitting here saying, well, I think they should do and what I see. It's what they tell us they are seeing. They believe in their minutes, Tom, that the risk of doing too little is bigger than the risk of doing too much. Right. Many people in that committee believe that, Tom, that means they think they've got more work to do. And until they say inflation coming down in a more convincing way and cracks in the economy, which many people assume aren't there yet in a material enough fashion, Tom, to get them to back away. I'd watch housing. It's all they got to say. I'm with you to housing. Sure. This is nationwide. It's not just about the big cities. Tom, I think the phrase I've heard is housing recession. You get a housing recession and some have a lot of... Yeah, but if you're John, if you own the house and like Matt Miller, you bought it at the top of the market. It's not a recession. It's a depression. Have you spoken to Matt? I have. You know, it's 8,000 square feet. Eight bathrooms. Sharing that pain. Well, get Miller on the show to talk about that. Yeah. South TK. I'm not going there. That's the cross asset price section. Let's get you some single names. We can do that with Lisa this morning. Hey, Lisa. Hey, and I will say that depression is probably leading more people to stay put and not be as mobile since they do not want to sell their homes at this point and see the repracing. What I'm watching right now is a series of earnings showing the haves and the have-nots. And this really can be seen in the airline industry in particular, United Airlines coming out tomorrow after market with their earnings. And we heard from Delta last week, how much are you going to see those airlines that actually cater to some of the business travelers and some of the upper end kinds of travelers do much better than say the jet blue jet blues of the world that cater more to the vacations. United Airlines is up 1.9% ahead of the open Delta up 1.7% jet blue liking behind just but also 1.4% but you're today you can see this divergence more clearly. And again, I keep coming back to the reason why this earnings season is going to be so difficult to come up with some sort of overarching conclusion because you see pockets of strength and a lot of-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3888,2022-10-17 11:35:40
15543," year today you can see this divergence more clearly and again I keep coming back to the reason why this earning season is going to be so difficult to come up with some sort of overarching conclusion because you see pockets of strength and a lot of those pockets of strength are dictated by the areas that cater to higher income individuals and businesses United Airlines down sharply but less than 20% delta down similar jet blue Tom down more than 50% catering to Florida catering to a lot of families catering to vacations at a time when people are rethinking whether they really want to fly around because if you check out some of the airplane tickets they're incredibly expensive and the marginal money that people have to spend is declining pretty quick my memory this is all David Rosenberg but my memory itemized Lisa was airline fairs last inflation report were up 42% exactly and a lot of this stems from the business travel and people who can afford it but a lot of people can't and I know anecdotally of so many people who have cancelled or not gone on vacations at this point or just driven because it is punitive for people who actually have some you know constrained discretionary income it will be interesting to see on the cash flow front earnings front how they do right now and this is a joy with the chaotic weeks that we've had in a Monday into another week of chaos and what's the bill joins us he said of America's fundamental fixed income at black rock with decades of experience but I want to cut to the chase in the great bond bear market what is the level of pain on level I was talking to axle in Washington and he said forget about the numbers of spreads, look at level. Find prices are down. What does it signal? Well Tom, I think that's a great point about spreads versus all-in levels. So the debt spreads for example, IG and high yield spreads aren't at recessionary wides that we've seen historically, but the all-in cost of capital has gone up substantially. And investment grade space you're talking about an index that's now is 6% yield. And in high yield space you've got companies that were funding a year or a year and a half ago at 4% to 5% that now can't get funded inside a 10. And may not be able to fund it all. So the cost of capital has gone up substantially. And I understand that there are a lot of really good savvy liability management strategies that firms employed and households employed by refinancing their mortgages two years ago. And that there's got these very attractive liabilities on the balance sheet. But the incremental spend, right? The next thing that one might invest in whether it's residential or commercial is going to be substantially more expensive from a debt capital standpoint. Let's talk about the great Dan Fuss at Luma Sales. And he would say that's great. You've got the free lunch of a high nominal yield. But do you buy that nominal yield into reduced credit quality and the amount of fixed income assets? Is there credit clouds out there that make this not an easy decision? Yeah, I think so. I mean, look, you guys were just talking about this. The Fed is on a mission. This is a very intentional and aggressive tightening of domestic monetary conditions in an effort to slow growth, slow demand, specifically loosen up the labor market a little bit to get inflation back to target. So, so, definitely there, there are going to be some things that probably break along the way. It'll be really, really hard to do it without some of that happening. And, but, but I also think at the same time, here's one of the interesting things. Volatility is so high in the rates market right now that it's really hard to look, you know, three months forward or six months forward. It's, it's hard to look more than three to six days forward because the fall is so high, right? So, think if you can take a step back and think about the valuation of high quality fixed income assets today, you can build a pretty reasonable portfolio, treasuries, agency mortgages, investment grade corporates where you can go in and do the name selection so that you can avoid some of the, the more stressed or potentially forward distressed names. You can build a high quality portfolio, intermediate maturity in the five to six percent range, including treasuries. So, you've got a flight to quality asset in there in a in a shock scenario. That's, we haven't been able to do that in nearly two decades. I mean, it's, it's, things are starting to look reasonable. I get it that we're probably not at the bottom and there's more stress to come, but things are starting to look pretty reasonable if you can take a longer time horizon. That, that is the key point. If you could take it longer time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3889,2022-10-17 11:40:24
15544," reasonable. I get it that we're probably not at the bottom and there's more stress to come, but things are starting to look pretty reasonable if you can take a longer time horizon. That is the key point. If you could take a longer time horizon and I wonder about some of these mutual funds or open-ended funds where there could potentially be withdrawals, especially when it comes to investment grade credit. It makes sense perhaps on a thesis basis, but on a real basis, investment grade is underperformed dramatically because of the rate story as well as this forced selling that we've seen from international investors to sell what you can, not what you want to, how much you concerned about that, creating some sort of fissure in the short term as you see things like what happened in the UK for some selling. 100 percent Lisa, that is exactly the right thing to be focused on. We've seen this movie before, right? When you tighten financial conditions this aggressively, this abruptly, things are going to break and where do they break first? Almost always, it's in the levered strategy, the levered business model. I would argue in the UK that, yes, the push toward a much more aggressive fiscal policy kicked off more pressure in an already deteriorating market, but the proximate cause of the real stress in the long-in volatility was the levered LDI business model and the increased margin calls. If you're levered, if you have to borrow to sustain your strategy, and importantly, if you have to pay higher margin calls, margin costs, excuse me, to maintain your leverage, you're in a really difficult spot right now. So those business models should be stressed and I wouldn't be surprised if we don't see some more of that before this is over over the next three to six months. Bob, thank you, sir. As always, Bob Miller, of BlackRock. Just picking up on the UK at the end there. I've got to want 13 handle again on Sterling against the US dollar in the guilt market. Let's pick out 30s because that's where the Bank of England was sitting, 30s and above your 30 year yield is low, at least, about 42 basis points this morning. And this feels more fundamental than some of the other questionable moves that we saw last week in response to temporary programs in the Bank of England. This is generated by a true fiscal response that people seem to like. There are some more details coming out. It is clear that Jeremy Hunt is leading the charge. Now we get more details at 1030. How much does that really edify some of these moves and send them further down and where are the scars? I think if this inflation re-boomed Tom is followed by some kind of disinflation rebust that the policies that were announced in the last couple of weeks in the UK will potentially be revisited in the years to come Tom. If we start to suffer with growth and have much more of a growth problem than an inflation problem, to Steve Shefferone's point, have federated if we can get yield started to come lower and not climb in. A lot of people might be clamoring for these kind of initiatives. That is the study of history. I went back and I mentioned David Rosenberg earlier and there's others besides Mr. Rosenberg who say yes, you get this inflationary bout and it takes care of itself and you get a disinflationary trend and you look back to 47, the Eisenhower deflation of 52, 53, you can actually get through deflation. It's just for a little bit of time. But the point here is if you come on the US continuum from 9%, what is the path and stopping point on the way to their vaunted 2%, that's a mystery. Do you think the inventory story of the 9 keys of this world, micron figures part of that UPS? You want to give us 4 GM. Tangible but secondary, Dana Telsi with a blistering note this morning that the only thing that's working is luxury. Well, except that services continues to climb. So how much is that offset? The disinflationary force that you're talking about and I've seen the discounts. They're not that big. I mean, have you seen the discounts? Is that aimed at target on 9 key? 9 key more. You're upset with 9 key. I'm not upset with I'm just saying theoretically if a child really liked, you know, our Jordans and the parent was still saying no, they're still possibly going to be saying no. That's not real. That's not real. That is a real conversation that the primary household. No, I'm just saying it's the only problem. No, it's the only thing that you were a mother who had a child who wanted some correct some 9 key. Yeah, that's not really expensive. I'm just saying. Would you explain to me why cummergar song has a converse sneaker that costs 10 times as much as converse sneakers. This of course isn't an actual conversation either.

Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word news to Ayn Leanne Gehrins. Newly appointed UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunter set up plans to try to bring order to the public finances and reassure markets after Liz Truss' economic programme triggered weeps of turmoil. We are keen to further roll back on some of the tax cuts planned by Truss and a shortening of planned universal energy support. No government can control markets, but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances. And that is one of the many factors that influence how markets behave. And for that reason, although the Prime Minister and I are both committed to cutting corporation tax, on Friday she listened to concerns about the mini budget and confirmed we will not proceed with the cut to corporation tax announced. Meanwhile, hand will address Parliament with even more details later today. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Leanne Gehrins, this is Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on it pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labour shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it.

What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be, you've got to show up and you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. You just, yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. We've got terrible sentiment on Wall Street, not much better sentiment on Main Street. And we've got a Fed that's orchestrating a monetary policy that just seems clearly unsustainable. It just can't last long. It's going to break something. That was Jim Post and the Chief Investment Strategist at the Luthold Group always great to catch up with Jim. I do straight on myself into these should shouldn't conversation around the Fed what they should do, what they shouldn't do. Ultimately we have to talk about what they will do and most people assume what they will do is hike again Tom in November by 75 basis points. And again now is when the lifting is difficult. I mean it's all been easy, we've talked about this. I think we've been way out front, uneasy decisions and now is where it matters where you're out one meeting, two meetings, even the first meeting of two. Jamie Dimon said of JP Morgan last week to Juliana over at CNBC. The next 100 basis points Tom is the most painful one. Yeah and there's the then one and I'm sorry they're just data dependent. I'm not spending too much time on it versus the challenges of the Powell approach to the rest of the world. Jan 14884 what do we do with the 149 Jan problematic. Yeah. So intervention doesn't work does it? I mean come on TK. You come in for a little bit and you don't scare anyone off. An even coordinated intervention which is a rare occurrence is a difficult not a rare occurrence is a discussion with Leland Miller of China Beige book to illuminate on China. He is just outstanding the co-founder and CEO of the hugely prestigious effort. Leland I got to go to the immediate news. The great George Magnus over in London today says he's never seen anything even in pestilence in conflict like a postponing of China GDP. This is your wheelhouse. What was your response when they postponed Q3 GDP? Well, look, I think the most obvious reason is that they are very busy on the party Congress. You saw all those pictures of people in wrapped attention to jails and statistic bureaus just sitting there very, very silently and without moving watching she speech. They probably just can't can't work because they're too busy listening but I don't think there's anything terribly nefarious behind it. We see with the data week they've been admitting the data week. I think it's probably making sure that there's not just another bomb dropping off in the middle of a very choreographed event. Forget about the choreographed event. What happens in the uncoreographed 2023 to the new dynastic G? Well, look, it'll take a few months for she to formally get the three positions. And so the question then will be, where does he pivot if at all? Everyone wants to see a pivot on COVID-0. There's been no indication that that pivot's coming. You could see how they would do it the rollout in 2023 but it's not just announcing COVID-0's over. It is saying, here's the policy, here's how we're going to do the rollout, here's how we're going to do it the fallout. And...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3892,2022-10-17 11:52:42
15547," you know, you know, here's the policy, here's how we're going to do the rollout, here's how we're going to do it to fall out and and and it's not at all clear that this isn't a, you know, you know, many months maybe your long transition. So is she going to pivot on the economy? Probably not. Is he going to pivot on COVID-0 at some point? Yes, but it probably not soon. Were there some small pivots, though, Lee, Linda, within this speech, basically around basically having a more business friendly environment, both for national and international companies. Yeah, look, I mean, it's hard at this point to see what's talking, what's not. I mean, if you, if you remember how excited investors got all throughout 2022, when, you know, some party official, Leo, Lee, Lee, Lee, Cuchon would come out and say, look, we're doing this differently or easing this crackdown or we're going to provide this stimulus. And nothing meaningful ever happened. So we'll have to wait and see. I think it would be who she to have some sort of outreach, particularly with the US China tensions to the Europeans. I think you're going to see some of that going forward. But in terms of making China more appealing to investors, you have to have regulatory certainty. You have to have some sort of idea of growth. You have to end COVID-0. You know, there's there's a lot of obstacles. It's not just saying we're going to be we're going to be friendly. Yeah, the idea of growth is key here. Economist predict that Chinese growth will slow to 3.3%. So this year, a lot of people say that that's probably a high ball estimate. I'm assuming that you probably think so given that you've talked about a two handle. The official target is 5.5%. The gap between those would be the biggest since they started setting GDP targets in the early 1990s. How much do you think that this is going to be a problem for this government where they start to inject more stimulus and start to support the housing market versus a reality of the new China in a new regime with a bigger middle class? Yeah, I don't think it's a problem at all for them because I think once they they descended into lockdowns in the spring, the 5.5.0 was not only gone, but even the fake let's pretend that we got somewhere near 5 was gone. So look, they can blame this on COVID-0. Yes, they're fault, but they, you know, there's a reason for not hitting these numbers. And the larger the larger thing is that they've changed their priority set. So yes, they still talk about high levels of growth for some reason, although the narrative's changing, particularly in the last couple of weeks. But that is that's not what they're focused on. It's not what they're worried about. They're going to try to deliver enough growth so they don't have a political problem. But the reality is they're trying to do some structural changes that are very painful and they're not going to be worried about the high hitting the high levels of growth anymore. Leila, in a 720 you want get you out not to 2005, but just all of a sudden get you out to a new week, Renminbi strategy. What's the level of Renminbi where that unravels? Do you have in your head a 7.xx level that this becomes difficult? I don't because it's a it's a dollar story, not a not a Yuan story. You know, if this were, if this were sort of a, a, a, Renminbi exploding because of the week Chinese economy while the dollar stays pat against other currencies, you'd have a different dynamic people would read into it differently. Right now everything is weakening against the dollar. So right the Chinese goal is to maintain relative stability relative strength as much as possible against against the rest of the world, but but making sure that things don't break on the way up. So so they want stability. There isn't a number. It all depends on how strong the dollar gets over the next six to 12 months. Thank you, sir. Always important stuff with in the middle. It's great, isn't it? Leila Miller there of the China beige book International? Yeah, when I first met him, he was looking at like utility costs electric stuff and I'm really refuting statistics. I think he would say the statistics today out of China. So you know, on radio, I've got quotes around the word believable that works that works. We just say it's better now, Lisa than it was, maybe back then. Yeah, although they just entirely scrapped the ones that were due. Yes, do do tomorrow. So there's an opportunity. Exactly. So there's that in terms of. Exactly. So they're not pretending, but they're just not disclosing it because it might not be what they want to say. Do you think on net? And I think this is an interesting thing to ponder. It's COVID zero good for the global economy or bad for the global economy. I get it from the supply side of things and we spent a lot of time talking about that over the last two years, but Tom, you've said it a million times about the demand side. Can you imagine if you had that full throttle demand data China. And what that would mean for this labor market and the inflation story. I don't even take it over to economics finance investment blah blah blah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3893,2022-10-17 11:57:14
15548, Throttle demand data China and what that would mean for this labor market and it's just science and the inflation story. I don't even take it over to economics finance investment blah blah blah. I need somebody who's an adult like at Johns Hopkins or all the other great epidemiologists and virologists we've talked to the fact of the matters it's bad science. But it doesn't care about that we've got to do the blah blah blah. The fact of the matter is this is the policy and we've got to work out what it means. It will there be an end of the policy is the hope. So I did not hear that from Leeland Miller. Although to your point John if they scrap it what does that do to gasoline prices what does that do to diesel prices what does that do to natural gas prices this is really the question at the same time does it help some of the supply chains that's a question that's not curious about. I don't know I don't know it's the long since I've been it's great to be back. That's the camera man. Yeah I know the tang is still literally. You confused by the fact there is an individual holding a camera. No I'm not just how long have you been away. How long enough for the tang to go back. Where's the camera man down in this here. Any fresh tang. Keep up TK TV radio. You're here. Present. Good. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future. It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What what we've asked the trading platforms the lending platforms the other various venues to come in to work with us to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform probabilities are they're not all non securities. Now there's another issue that shows a risen which is called gamification which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon. We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies revenues rather than our returns. And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification. It's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Cheypah will say things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next second shift. From business is most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bull farm. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with.

15549," Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Merriots, Lenio Berg, Adrian Mitchell from Macy's, and Lucas Eremella at Mondelies. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. Under the circumstances, the Fed is going to keep continued to raise the aggressively till they see the need to go down. I think the Fed is going to continue to be on this path for quite a few months. I definitely think we'll see another 75 basis point move in November. The more aggressive they get, the more you're going to bring recession fear as the primary fear over inflation. Because of the Fed over doing this, we're going to end up back where we were 10 years ago. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keen, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Brahmins and Tom Keen out of Monday, just like all the recent Mondays chaos out there on radio and television. All I can tell is, futures up 44, Dow futures up 303, and it doesn't matter, John, we're still looking at goofy stuff like foreign exchange and bonds. Chaos in here, or chaos as well? Chaos everywhere. Podre is one, lean alone. Was that chaotic? It was really chaotic at the end. It was the second largest comeback or beating, I should say, of a ranked team like the Dodgers since 1926. And 1926. Or did the Dodgers lose? Dodgers lost. No questions. Adore the Podre's, but the fact is the Dodgers like the Mets were in a fog. Do you want to squeeze pers in there too? Or you're done on the sports side? No, I didn't. First it okay. What I want to do is United Kingdom in two and a half hours. What's the so-what, John? About 1030 this morning for global Wall Street. I can't answer one, plain and simple. We haven't seen this since the Berlin-Skoney government back in Italy in the Eurozone debt crisis, where the debt market, financial markets, foreign exchange, pushback, so severely as force the government do it to do a complete reversal, you turn on pretty much everything I saw this, John, this weekend. I would not use it. It's inflammatory, but with AC Milan doing so well, I can come there. Thanks Tom. Is the United Kingdom on the edge of becoming Italy? I don't think so. It's got its own central bank doing its own thing. And I don't think it's quite compares to what happened in the Eurozone debt crisis. I do think, Tom, in this situation, this government has been forced to do something it did not want to do. And I won't even go further because I don't think it's even controversial this morning, Tom, in the UK. The chance that's leading this country now, not the Prime Minister. These policies are a piece. And perhaps even Rishi Sunax, they're certainly not the policies of the Prime Minister, Liz Trust. Let's bring it home. We just sum up all this international bladder, including the wonderful discussions in Washington. Great. But for regular America, to me, they're being almost left behind by the elite conversation. When you say regular America, you're talking middle and lower income. People that are looking at rents up mortgage resets, they're looking at tuition's up in food, food, food. And right now, Bank of America's CEO, Brian Moynihan, is talking in the earnings call and saying that the resilience is still there. That yes, you're seeing consumers continue to spend. I'll be a little bit of a slower pace in terms of the growth. However, this really is the dissonance where, right? And are there entire segments of a population that cannot continue to keep going with this? And what does that do to consumer expectations? John mentioned earlier, Tom, that report that we got out on Friday about the one year ahead in Flation Expectations as reported by the University of Michigan. Ripon stuff. I know you dismiss it because it's 500 people that they call and you've never gotten called. But I do wonder if this is significant because it does. Just set the scene. You get one of those phone calls from the University of Michigan. What is that? An upper? It's that right. You get the call out of An upper. Okay. So they give me the call and they say, do you, where do you think inflation is going to be one year from now? Is that actually how that goes? I don't know. And they say five percent. I have received it. I don't live in Michigan. I don't receive that. I don't know if it's just Michigan. But listen, they've actually been somewhat accurate in terms of reflecting the zeitgeist in America. Business is what they are going to do. How are you doing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3895,2022-10-17 12:06:29
15550," live in Michigan. I don't receive that. I don't know if it's just missing a bit listen. They've actually been somewhat accurate in terms of reflecting the zeitgeist in America. Now how much is this simply an issue? Stop laughing at me that this is just looking at the gasoline prices and then you know getting getting getting in. You see, Sarah, the AC Milan shirt. I'm fine. The fly. With the beer in the stand with Liverpool on the background going well. I mean, I can tell you exactly where it is going to be one year from now. Let me check the gasoline aspect of this is clearly effect. Yes, price of bounce back. Look, we spoke to who was it we spoke to around the the jobs report, Ronnie Krozen, and he said no, John, they target their target PCE called PCE. That's it. Give me a break. Chairman powers told me to look at ECI. That's why he did the pivot back in late last year. He told me to look at you, Mitch. That's why we going to come in with a big red height than it's expected. And that's the problem with the Fed right now, Tom. We can sit here and say what they shouldn't do is what they are doing and they've told us they look at this stuff. Rob Walden, an adjorn is here in a bit from investment on the challenges of institutional buying investment. John, I want to dive into the data and I'm going to lead with the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index. Is it negative 1.50, which is the most restrictive except for February March, COVID. That's stunning. And that's been the story and the objective to Bob Miller of Black Rock's point. Future is right now elevated. Thank you for America doing OK in the pre market as well up by about 2.7% of banks so far. The bank so far, Tanninus, kind of what we already knew, which is the economy's resilient. The consumers do an OK. We're building up provisions because we think there might be a storm on its way. There seems to be the story of not just the earnings season, but the commentary of the last two months. And the VIX 32.1 really doesn't move. We need that below 30 to give us any kind of good feeling. What else do we see, John? Nothing. I haven't got the down on my board. Tom, where's that? The down's up 283 points 29,093. I see complete chaos. That's what you said. Do we get down 30K hats? We do. We do visit. No, not 30. 40K. You got that. You would store them off. You have to pay me to wear one of those things. How much? Like serious, serious money. $10,000 for charity. And I do the show in a down 30K hat. Everyone take note of that. If you can do, if you can raise enough money for it, there you go. And we'll give it to a good course. People who need the education about using a down on the hands of the agency. Exactly. OK. John, it's like the autumnal leaves glowing from Labrador down. Lisa did the leaf peep and thing this weekend. It's the glow. John of our here. Is that an actual term? No, no, it is actually. No, retirees and papers. OK, you see I go up and go up and go to the house. People that peep leaves. Yeah. I'm a leaf. Please. I don't think you want to admit that. Can you see me on a bus up at Bretton Woods at Mount Washington? Oh, there's so beautiful. There was really bad. Yeah, there's not a term. Is that a moose? It's not a term. It sounds right. OK. Now, right now we're going to try to sell what's a show. We do this with Robert Walden. Rob Waldener's chief fixed income strategist and head of macro research in Vesco. And he joins us. I hope this morning is well. Rob, you do a big institutional money. It is a bond bear market. How do you extract yourself from the price to clients you've enjoyed? I think Tom, the story is one of the right. It has been a bond bear market. But underlying that, if we think about it, we've seen such increases in yields. I mean, real yields have gone up in the last couple of months, 150 basis points or so. That we're really offering value. So I think the question I think should be refrained, which is for the first time we have quite a bit of value in fixing income. And you know, that's where we think clients can start to generate, lock in, longer term returns. And we think that's a compelling investment opportunity. Rob, when did you think they're going to start delivering some price appreciation? I'm talking about treasury specific the reason I asked that Rob is we had this conversation earlier when the bonds start behaving like bonds when you'll start to fall because growth concerns are building so much. When do we get that? Well, I think in terms of the bond market, we have to disagree the front end versus the the longer end, right? And I think we see signs of some stability in the long run. We think the curve will continue to avert. Wouldn't be surprised we get the high yield this quarter in the longer end of the market. And let's say the 10-year sector but with the Fed, you know, committed to 75 basis points of quarter for a meeting for the next two meetings, you know, the outside.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3896,2022-10-17 12:10:46
15551," the 10 year sector, but with the Fed, you know, committed to 75 basis points of quarter for a meeting for the next two meetings, you know, it's probably the first quarter, second quarter next year where we get a peak in the two year. But, you know, we're seeing this aversion of the market of the bond market, which will probably continue. I mean, it's a good point, though, John. I've been favoring sort of, sort of, as moving into investment grade in particular because of the widening spreads and over the last several weeks or months. And we have, we're still, you know, we're at our wide and yield. So I do think it is, it does make a very compelling opportunity now even more than it has over the last month. How do you deal, Rob, with investors, with you clients that want short-term investments or want the ability to withdraw their cash and longer-term investments? When even investment grade debt is not immune to the technical selling that will come into effect, if there is some sort of international event that forces people to sell what they can, not what they want to. So I think you're referencing back to the kind of event that we have in the UK, right? Or ultimately, what happened in the UK is the rise of real yields, really pressure. Investors who were, or the UK pension funds, who had a lot of long-data assets, and then own these higher quality assets in the sell, the I strategy, they're forced to sell those higher quality assets. And I think there is the potential for that to continue. But I think, in our view, we've seen a lot of the selling that's coming out of the UK pension funds. We may find some more places where we're going to force leverage to unwind. But we don't see a lot of leverage in the system this time relative to some of the past times. At least it's not obvious where it leverages. But have you ever heard of leaf peeping? I have. I've never heard of that. I've never heard of that. So I'm from New England and I have, really, from Maine. And if you're from New England, you know about leaf peeping. The peak time of tourism in Maine is sort of September until we're leaf peeping. Yeah. Leaf peeping. Yes. Rob Wondrow and Viscayne. I'm in charge. Look, guys, the matter of fact check, and I've had to do on this programme over the years, particularly with you. So I've googled it and obviously it's got its own page. I've no idea if Tom's behind this page. Leaf peeping is an informal term in the United States and Canada for the activity in which people travel to view four in areas where leaf change colours in autumn. Tom, there's different names, different places in Japan. This custom is called Mamejigari. Oh, man. In Finland, the season is Ruska and a trek is called Aruska Trekkie. Can you see Pharaoh? And Lisa, can you see Pharaoh and his Elo being boots up to your knees, the dark brown ones, in Millenacke, Clouton Mount Katak. Okay. So we do have someone writing in saying that in Boston, they're called leafers. Leafers? Not leafy. Not leafy. Exactly. You're called a leafy. The matter of traffic, and it was kind of hilarious going up to see the leaves, was really intense and people were kind of like, you know, pushing you out of the way. Well, I was... You get up to a hundred and tenth street. And people were kind of like, you know, I should do this. Well, I'm not doing the peeping. I just... I did go upstate just weekend. It was beautiful. You should have been over the walk up in the leafy. It was gorgeous. The longest trek you and I have done is from one bar to the other. That's true. You think we're going to go and do a trek or a central bar? People are shot by this fact, right? John and Ray Tristan and Laura come and out from New York City. This is Bloomberg.

Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries and the Anne Gerrins, this is Bloomberg. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space of the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that, of course, was made possible by the politician. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3898,2022-10-17 12:18:52
15553,"... When US inflation numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. The US-CPI America 40 year high. It yields absolutely fine. It carries down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? We are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? The down shift just keeps getting pushed out. Now it looks like we're going extra innings. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your Global Business Authority. While my expectation is that rates are going to have to move higher for a sustained period, I do see risk around moving to abruptly to this new higher level. The economy is going to be a little bit more expensive. Moving too fast can disrupt financial markets and the economy in a way that ultimately could be self-defeating. That's the judge of the Kansas City Fed. Interesting comments after say Tom. I have for longer but ultimately questioned the speed at which you get that. Not too quickly seems to be the pushback. Remember we were at the Pioneer Growth of Jackson Home in East. She was there with the puppy pivot. We are seeing from someone regional agricultural base with a different view than financial New York or financial. Some of these states, Tom, they have employment rate so much lower. We can, the futures up 38. Jordan Rochester here in our studio is G10 FX strategist at Nomura. For global Wall Street, this is the conversation of the day. Almost up to 149, Nomura doesn't have a relationship with the government so I think you can talk freely. What is the nature of Japanese reserves? They have seen really smart articles including from your shop that a lot of the reserves are really immovable and they have only got X number of interventions available if they choose to intervene. Comment on that. Let's not downplay it. The size of the FX reserves is massive. It is usable as it is reachable. It is usable as at least $100 billion in cash. That is a significant amount for this market. We saw the bank Japan when they did intervene for the Ministry of Finance. It was large and you saw a big drop in Dolly-N. The question, Tom, is why haven't we seen them come back in with this move we have had towards getting closer to 150. We are long Dolly-N right now looking for 150. It is happening a lot faster than the United States. You are looking for a week. That is right. That is driven by policy change or intervention of the bank at that 150. I think positioning is a part of it. When the bank Japan intervened, it was not a good trade to be Long Dolly-N anymore because I am taking on the largest central bank in terms of FX reserves in the world. I am going to focus on the power and the focus on Aussie. I will do Euro. A lot of people took their short yen positions off and going into that inflation number on Friday, I said look, this is a big number. Positioning is really stretched long dollars in Euro-stirling. Where is the position that lightest? It is in the yen. That move we are having now is people putting on fresh trades and not having much to take off. This is short term tactical stuff. Can we get just out to next spring? Life after Coroda when he steps away from the central bank. How does policy change? The risks are we have a more hawkish banked Japan. But I think that they are waiting for the Fed to do their pivot. I like the puppy pivot and analogy there. Hopefully we get that pivot by February much. Then the banked Japan will be rescued in a way. They won't need to hike interest rates or change yield curve control or be aggressive on monetary policy. The underlying fundamentals of Japan, of course CPI in Japan, is nearly nine times slower than America. There is no need to be looking the same as the Fed. But in April we get the wage negotiation data. If it is strong, we have second round effects from Japan. Then maybe we will get more hawkish banked Japan going forward. Meanwhile, over in the United Kingdom, I want to get your thoughts on what is going on over there. Because you had a 5-5 conviction that we are going to get to what? 95 on the cross by the end of the year. Have you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3899,2022-10-17 12:23:41
15554," in the United Kingdom, I do want to get your thoughts on what's going on over there because you had a five of five conviction that we're going to get to what 95 on the cross by the end of the year. Have you rethought that based on some of the recent fiscal moves? The fiscal moves are causing huge volatility, but the one lesson I learned Lisa from trading Brexit over the years, we were called Mr. Brexit at Nemura back in 2016, is don't trade sterling based on politics. It's too fast. You can't get an edge and that's what's happened. If you were short sterling, long sterling, the moves have been extremely volatile. The reason we have five out of five in conviction on that short sterling view is based on the macro fundamentals because if you trade the politics, it's like having a chocolate tea pot. It looks nice, sounds good, but it's really poor in practicality terms. Politics and trading effects only last one day, two days. For me, slowing growth in the UK, the Bank of England hiking into a recession, that makes the UK asset base look very unattractive to investors. I think this recession risk is going to get worse over winter or have possible blackouts in the UK. Right now, this morning, there's a bit of euphoria because Jeremy Hunt has tightened monetary fiscal policy in a dramatic way. I didn't expect the energy price cap to be changed, but it has been changed. It will end in April, the universal package. So, guilt can rally because of this sort of euphoria, but I do think it's short term and will still be in the same situation where European UK look pretty unattractive as recession risks get bigger. So both the Japanese story as well as the British story have one thing in common, which is they're on the other side very much of the dollar story. The dollar continues to represent the dynamism of a US economy that stands out as probably the strongest in the developed world. When does that change? When does the rest of the world start to really impede on what we're seeing in the US? I think it's in February and March. That's the sort of timing I have for dollar weakness to come back in. Reasons for that are will hopefully be for the worst of winter. The projections for the gas storage in Europe hopefully says we've made it. Don't worry, we're not going to have severe blackouts. And then by that point, the Fed should be approaching their terminal rate, 525-550s, kind of where we have it at Nomura. And then from that point, the market will say, right, they've got to 550, the only ways down from here. Even though there's possible they could go higher, they can't always rule that out. But I think from that moment, the sort of US higher rates driving the dollar, the terms of trade story, hopefully all turns in February, March. If you've done, Mami Jigari in Japan. Yes, a little bit. Japanese leaf, Pee Pee. Did you have to look it up again? No, I speak Japanese. We have a conference in Kyoto. It's a central bank's conference around March time. It's absolute beautiful. All the flowers, all the leaves on the trees are white and pink, and it's one of my special things in the world. Don't you believe me? No, it's great. I'm very cultured. OK, I'm not saying you don't speak Japanese. Do you know what's great about this? Nomura flies in diva. I don't know, Chester. John, thank you. It's going to see it. I think that's wonderful. Going to get some news out of credit swiss. If you're telling me so, it's quite the news. Yeah. OK, quite the news. The investment bank chief is set to leave the company in the coming weeks, amid a broad overhaul of the group that will likely see the units cease to exist in its current form. The latest reporting from our team over in Switzerland. So he's expected this announcement and this departure is expected to be made on October 27th. Those of you familiar with that date will know that's also went from credit swiss. We get the bank's new strategic review. This all according to people familiar with the matter. As you know, Tom Lisa, Credit Suisse has been a mess for a long, long time now. We've had leadership change after leadership change after leadership change and the date and everyone's diary is 10 days away. It is October 27th. So how much are they basically going to have to now? It's peace by peace of this strategic review before it comes out in order to a peace markets that are eager to hear what's next. I mean, how much can trickle out before they have to release it early at a time when you already have seen incredible credibility loss as people speculate about what gets sold and what doesn't back 20 years. This guy's been through Morgan Stanley Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs International for 10 years, then Lehman, then Nomura, then Bank of America. And I think that's where he finding lands at Credit Suisse. I mean, the whole IB model, Witness Goldman Sachs today, and Shree is going to be on with this year global Wall Street. And a bit, I mean, it's almost like IB is under threat right now over what do we do next? Well, for this particular bank, Tom, according to our reporting, he's been focusing on the overhaul of the investment bank is now looking at options including start the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3900,2022-10-17 12:27:40

That's going to be the best question I get all night. Bloomberg Television. It's great question. One of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me building. I'm pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. I know you don't have to worry about that. I have to worry about the future. Do you have to worry about that. I've had to worry about that. This is a big deal. I don't know if you had to worry about that. Michael McKee actually did not come on. He would have otherwise come on if he thought it was a big deal. I'm going to go and get it. It wasn't that notable. It is slightly deteriorating. I'm not going to say more about that. Tom's not even looked at it. We do this with Oliver Veta. He's the chief executive officer of Aliens. He's been on a tour of duty for a good number of years to see their success. All John and I want to know is you have the football sponsorship of the soccer team, the football team from Munich is well. We see the sponsorship of sports. What's the value to Aliens, the payoff of Byron Munich? Oh, it's hugely positive because that's the best brand in sports, at least in our country. And we've been associated with it for many, many years. I'm very, very proud of it. Now you have a bond at Bear Market. Some would say your best brand in acquisition was the Grocelelearian Combine of Pacific Investment Management Company years ago. Give us an update on bond asset management and the view forward given this great bond bear market. Well, the current circumstances are tough, but it's very good to be with the best company in these environments. So we see a flight to quality over time. People are watching, but because we have a very long duration business model, we look forward. We believe it's going to be fantastic for Pincône as over the next few years, as the interest rates stabilize. Because the money will come back into bonds and think about accumulation at the interest rates that we have. People off your own run and a simple NPV model and say, what does it mean if you reinvest at 5% or 4.75, rather than zero? You buried an important line there. It was in there, but it was buried when interest rates stabilize. Yeah, they're not stable. What did you make of what happened in the guild market in the last couple of weeks? What are the lessons you've learned from that? The first one is if you have a political idea that it's not anchored in economics, it's very dangerous. Particularly if you're not the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3902,2022-10-17 12:40:22
15556," And she's learned from that. The first one is if you have a political idea that it's not anchored in economics, it's very dangerous. Particularly if you're not the world reserve currency like the US dollar. We have learned that number one, Brexit now will start to pay the price and you see that. And the second thing is that markets have become to dominate again. We're coming out of 15 years of quantitative using, no price for risk, nothing, no fiscal discipline, no monetary discipline and suddenly that's back and people have to get used to the fact that the laws of physics hold again, even for governments. Well, we were talking about how this gives room and gives rise once again to bond vigilantes. Yes. Are you the bond vigilantes? Do you actually actively go through some of the policies and say, not going to buy this company, not going to buy this nation because of what they're doing? I wouldn't be thinking about negative selection because that's what we should talk about. But we're looking at countries and companies that properly manage. If you have a dual deficit, think about that three years ago, we had three times the financial stimulus in the United Kingdom that we saw a few days ago. Nothing happened in the markets. Right, nothing happened. Everybody was sleeping. And then suddenly people wake up to the fact that what has been done is really a disaster and suddenly the prices are coming. Why is that? Because of inflation, people have started to reprise assets fundamentally, not just bonds. And by the way, we are not even at the midpoint of repricing of assets. We've just seen the liquid assets reprise. The rest will come now. When you said actively selecting specific companies, specific nations, this speaks to the active selection that so many different fund managers talk about now. Yes. It is really rating supreme. Where does that leave passive management? It's really interesting. So it is different between equity markets. If you have large cap equity, you can invest in them very effectively through index. If you're in the bond market, and you don't know where things are going, you better be with the people that know what is happening and can differentiate. It's a great proof point. So I hope that all our colleagues are proving themselves now. I'd like to repeat something you said moments ago. The liquid markets have reprised. The liquid markets haven't yet. Yeah. What's that going to look like? We've spent a long time talking about pulling back the veil and some of the carnage that might take place because of 10 years worth of zero interest rates. And what we get told is that in public markets and credit balance sheets are strong. The resilience is there. The maturity walls is way out on the horizon, not coming soon. What's going to happen in private markets? I am not a great investor. So let's just start. I'm trying to do to be a good manager. Just pick it up and just say, which is very hard. But it's very hard to see it. And therefore, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. So people have to face a lot of scrutiny now on how the funding is. So watch out more, not just leverage, but liquidity. I think, and we saw that in the guild market, people do underestimate liquidity traps. And that's something that we need to look for. And you see that in private equity, when people look where our earnings really coming from are, they're trading amongst each other, are there true exits? What are the funding structures? So it's going to go through real estate, private equity, just slow, slow motion, but it's going to come. The gravity's back. The risk free rate is back as well. Talk about conservative money, pension money. Forget about LDI and the generations in London. Just normal institutional money. What's the shock going to be as the risk free rate returns? So the key thing is really, and that's what we also have to do, think about resilience. The point is, the shocks will be harder than people anticipate. The diversification is the thing that is never there when you need it the most. So people really need to look at their models and saying, how come the world completely missed out on inflation? I mean, when you think about the fact that in November of last year, we've started to buy inflation linked bonds a lot. A lot of people are still saying, yeah, but in the middle of this was all central banks, even some of our business economies. So the question is, why is that happening? And the first answer is, I don't know why, but what I know is we have to de-risk at the top. So how do you de-risk? You just bring in duration. Do you have to change your actual world or something? How do you de-risk? Systematically. With adult money. Yeah. The adult money is basically, yes, if we were completely in an endowment, you would really selectively take risk. In this environment, we can't with a double A rating in one of the few places in the world that Don't I read, even give the impression that we don't have our tail risk under control. Given that you're based in Europe right now, how can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3902,2022-10-17 12:41:51
15557," rating in one of the few places in the world that Don't I read, even give the impression that we don't have our tail risk under control. Given that you're based in Europe right now, how concerned are you about the prospect that the pain that you're experiencing now, both from a business and an investment perspective, is not just going to be this winter, it's also going to be next winter, it's also going to be potentially for years to come if there is not some sort of sustainable energy plan put into effect. I have to be a realist but I'm also a born optimist otherwise I think I couldn't do the job. Right, so the first thing is I think particularly the key thing is that people I think have been overselling Germany if I may say so. So like give you an example, we have had demand contraction on gas 15 percent already this year. Now much for example, it's a little bit only 2 percent. So we will have most likely enough gas to come through the winter, people do not factor that in. Now the second question is what will be the implication for industry to reprise its products and its production supply chains to a higher energy price and that's happening. I really believe in our engineering capability is very comparable to Western Switzerland where everybody said when you know the Swiss bank was floated that all the manufacturing companies would die. No, no, we invest in innovation will be very good. Right. The key thing is however we need for Europe to realize now one important thing. Germany needs to really focus on reinventing its business model. It's over with cheap energy from Russia, successful exports to China and America providing all the security. I mean that three formula is ending and that requires a lot of energy on the German people to fix it small which means we have less attention and tolerance for dwelling out money to other people. This has been really really informative sir, just wonderful to have you in with this but this isn't why we had you in. You people finance barren Munich, the soccer team in Munich. Are you guys going to steal Harry Kane from Tottenham? I mean that's the only reason we had you. Are you going to bankroll this football team in Munich to steal the jewel of the United Kingdom? Even if I knew the answer I wouldn't be able to tell you. I mean this is the only reason we had the arenas. I called up Quantus and I said get the guy from Alliance in. I said get him in. Because these are the people that are going to steal Harry Kane. Are we going to do the show from from by Munich? I think October it says fantastic. You're from France. I have to say do you like the Dortmund fans too though? Yeah, they're pretty impressive. And you know every forced German is our client so we have a lot of door. You like the Dortmund fans. It's going to be very difficult. Yeah and then you vent us the early on the arena. And you vent us a lot. How many stadiums do you have? Quite a few. Quite a few. 12. 12. 12. The cross-Europeal worldwide. No worldwide. For example in Sao Paulo the stadiums also branded Alliance. It's been a great investment. Have you been there? Have you been there? It's amazing. Yeah it's really and people take a lot of attention. And you know football does something that politics can't do this is we unite people. We bring people together. We make them enjoy their lives regardless by the way most often on both sides you know whether winners and losers and therefore it's great it's bipartisan. Do you realize if Harry King goes some Tottenham to Munich it's un-American? I mean that's un-American. I've been trying to tell Tom Gray's sport in the world just the greatest sport in the world nothing close to it. It just is truly the most brilliant sport. What was the way to cover? Regardless whether it's Juventus or Bayern would be delayed to host you. Well thank you we'll take that under it. Advising can you two have a discussion in the world cup first discussion in the world cup and Bloomberg surveillance? You want to throw that in now? Yeah. Germany and Katta what are you looking for sir? Do you think you can make it happen when a world cup another one? I don't know it's a lot of a lot about passion but it's also about you know the right moment and to have the energy when it really matters. I certainly crossing my fingers but the most important thing is to have a great great great tournament. Can you tell FIFA we never want to do this winter world cup ever again? I think it's a travesty. I really do. I agree. We're taking a month off in the middle of the season to the world. Oh yeah that's it. That's a hearty it's ridiculous. It's been air conditioning in the football stadiums. Yeah interesting choice but it is there and so I think we're always great at criticizing things I think you'll be fantastic. We're fantastic. It's always too fantastic. That's what this shows about. Thank you for coming. I love it. Good to see you. From New York City this morning. Good morning.

15558," The A&C for New York City this morning. Good morning. This is Flunberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word news, I'm Leanne Gerens. Here in the UK, the newly appointed Chancellor Jeremy Hunter set out plans to bring order to the public finances and reassure markets after Liz Tross' economic programme Triggered Weeks of turmoil. He announced a further rollback of some of the tax cuts planned by the Prime Minister and a shortening of planned universal energy support. No government can control markets, but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances. And that is one of the many factors that influence how markets behave. And for that reason, although the Prime Minister and I are both committed to cutting corporation tax, on Friday she listened to concerns about the mini budget and confirmed we will not proceed with the cut to corporation tax announced. Meanwhile, Hunt will address Parliament with more details later today. Ukraine's government says Russia launched kamikaze drones this morning. The explosions hit the centre of Kiev, damaging several homes. It is the second strike on the capital in a week in Luxembourg, European Union foreign ministers, or due to a gree on the launch of a new mission to train around 15,000 Ukrainian personnel and sign off an additional $487 million in weapons financing.

So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure of making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year, that would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3904,2022-10-17 12:48:27

You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now it's completely innovating the way training's going, completely changing the way recovery is going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

I definitely think we'll see another 75-based point move in November. And I had thought they would slow down to 50 in December and I'm going to cling to that for the moment. But certainly if the inflation numbers over the next couple of months come in the way that the last two have, then it's not clear to me that they can step down from these 75-based point hikes.

It is a story that has been anticipated written by Sri, not a Rajin of Bloomberg News today. And it shows not a fractured Goldman Sachs that overstates it, but a Goldman Sachs looking to the end of the year in 2023 is one big challenge. Sri, thank you so much for joining us here on the Traveils of David Solomon. I'm going to cut to the chase. William Cohen's book on Goldman Sachs. Chapter 2 is called the Family Business. And Goldman Sachs has always been that emotion from the 19th century as well. The Solomon is completely removed from the fabric of that chapter and Cohen's book. How threatened is he now by those that yearn for a Goldman Sachs that was a family business? He would certainly tell you David Solomon that it is not a family business. They don't want to run Goldman Sachs like this partnership that it used to be. They see this as a fortune-hundred company, one that has a corporate setup. One wears one prime CEO and everyone who falls under him. Now, four years in, what is the market on David Solomon? This is the third major reorganization of his business lines that he's undertaking in just four years in the top seat. In fact, with this one, he's undoing some of the signature moves from his last major restructuring in 2020. That, to us, definitely feels like a move that has been taken under pressure. And in response to some of the criticism that senior management has faced inside and outside the firm. What is the pressure versus a partnership board structure versus a publicly traded board structure? Is there heat from the board or selected members or is it from the managing partners, whatever the modern phrases of partnership? Ultimately, you're responsible to the shareholders. If the share, if the Goldman Sachs stock had been outperforming everyone else in the financial services universe, there would be no pressure. It doesn't matter if there's griping, it doesn't matter if there's complaining and grumbling inside the firm. But that's not been the case. In the last four years, the firm has not been able to re-rate the stock. It has not been able to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3905,2022-10-17 12:53:08
15560," Doesn't matter if there's gripping, doesn't matter if there's complaining and grumbling inside the firm But that's not been the case in the last four years the firm has not been able to re-rate the stock It has not been able to get that jump over Morgan sadly It has not been able to get that jump relative to JP Morgan when that happens when there are so many changes And a CEO who's trying to change the very fabric of Goldman Sachs from what it used to be 20 years ago to what he hopes It will be down the road It will create a certain level of discontent and that will bubble up to the surface like we're seeing how much has David Solomon lost the faith not only in investors not only in the board but also of people within the rank and file of Goldman Sachs It will be very hard to say that he has enjoyed the full and total support office executive team Having said that he would argue that four years is not enough time He still has a few years in him. He still has enough time to make the pivot and tell a story to share holders and investors and analysts that actually presents Goldman Sachs as a company for the future But when he has to make strategy reversals and about turns It just becomes harder to land that narrative and make sure that it sticks What was the story with the consumer unit considering that they've lost money consistently and now seem to be reversing And that's important because one of the big changes that they're planning with this reorganization effectively involves dismembering the consumer unit as it used to be A lot of the direct to consumer push that was operated under this Marcus Brandneum is getting shoved into this larger asset and wealth management group The partnerships that they had with Apple in general motors, the green sky, FinTech company that they bought last year Transaction banking will exist as a standalone business much smaller than what it used to be And will show losses at least for the future How does someone like Apple respond to that? Apple doesn't mind as long as they have the leverage in their relationship with it clearly have They do not care about the internal dynamics at Goldman Sachs But Mike May or Wells Fargo gives us the best analogy to him What they're doing with the consumer is effectively equivalent to the demotion of Pluto as a planet That's so Mike Mayer If you know Mike Mayer that's so Mike Mayer does that put you on Pluto? What happens to Utah Goldman Sachs after this reorg? It stays there still committed to a lot of the text tags that they're building and that is part of the reason where they have such a big presence in Utah It's not so much for the call centers in Utah and Texas but for the tech platforms that they're building Why now? I mean, Goldman Sachs reports earnings tomorrow We're going to parse through them Is this a sign that there could be some huge negative surprises having to do with the consumer banking unit? Is it because they are failing to deliver on the fundamental level or is it just simply a coincidence that comes especially ahead of a new economic cycle? Well, three things Hopefully no surprises with respect to the consumer business because we've been telling our readers and listeners and watches that It is going to face a big loss-making year at media Goldman projected that the consumer business was on track to lose more than 1.2 billion dollars This reorganization will change some of those numbers But equally important because consumer was not working the way they hope to They are taking it to a narrower lane and hoping that they stick it to a business that plays to its strengths Equally important in the last four years David Solomon and John Walden his deputy they had not necessarily been playing up the strength of trading and banking at Goldman Sachs Which let's be honest is Goldman's core business and something that they're really really good at How many days does he left? How many weeks does he left? How many quarters does he left? I suspect the Goldman Sachs board and even his management team will cut him some slack and will have more patience for him than Tom King We got to go Well, I'm not saying me but I'm saying that That's all I'm just making for the audience on radio and TV They want to know about this soap opera that is three Thank you days of our lives with three not a Roger at Goldman Sachs At least I'm looking at the interday on Jan Guess what folks Jordan Rochester did it we moved in stronger Japanese yen 148 Down to 1462 these are teeth ween's moves But the the germane here is you wonder about the intervention watch yeah the bigger question how much intervention can they actually do with stomach They have for or reserves that they willing to use to simply stave off the declines that they see In terms of versus the US dollar the bigger question though is just a sea change Really driven by the strength of the US dollar and you really were good on this when you do Yeah, you said the IMF is very concerned about this What about swap lines what about the shortage of dollar",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3906,2022-10-17 12:57:45
15561," a sea change really driven by the strength of the US dollar and you really were good on this when you were a man. You said the IMF is very concerned about this. What about swap lines? What about the shortage of dollars? What about the liquidity concerns globally? When does this become a problem that really impedes back on the US? Not yet. And that's the reason why you're seeing the strength in the world. And I'm not going to go to the numbers now, but the restriction on BFCI, the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Exit, tangible equity markets lift here. I don't know if it's because of Yan or whatever, but futures of 51 down futures up 337. I'm not going to pretend to give any narrative to this because some of the rallies recently have been pretty shocking. I think going back to what Mike Wilson said of Morgan Stanley when he was talking about the likelihood or the possibility of a 16% rally in the next couple of weeks and months heading into earnings and after and then boom, back down to 3200 for the S&P. Just gives you a sense of how volatile people are expecting this to bring. One question I had I never was able to get you on this leasedy today. It's been so busy. There's been shifts in yield. What's the spread market done? The spread market has widened, but not as much as you would think. You are starting to see a big deal of stress. We're starting to see an idea of stress. Yeah, well, I mean, significant, but in certain pockets, but not as much as some people think there will be. Really interesting Monday. We're going to have stay with John Ferell for the idea of the Dow up 343 points 30,000 level again on the Dow. It's got to be back. This is Bloomberg. Good morning. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order? It's going to look like how much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

A good morning, good morning. It can't answer the open. Stats right now. Everything you need to get set for the started US training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrow. A life from New York City we begin with the big issue, can the US weather the storm? We give a chicken going on right now. Inflation was supposed to be moderating. Now it looks like we're going into extra earnings. There's still too high. We need to see some of that weakness coming through. That should be the next to shoot that drops. We're not going to have a typical V-bottom that markets have come to expect. It's more of a slow call crash. If you really start thinking about what's going on in the US economy, we're in this disability vacuum that people don't know what to do with it. Fed is trying to hike and crack the economy. This is presenting a real challenge. It's more about the Fed right now than about Fusebrook. It's just this uncertainty just keeps weighing on investors. I think this progress is just taking a little bit longer than we thought. Joining us now to discuss all-star panel to kick off the training week. TPW's J.P.Loski alongside Invest goes Matt Brill. J.F. first to you buddy. Let's start with the US economy. Resilient. Standing up to abuse from the Federal Reserve. How much longer can it do so? Well, John, we've been a believer in what we call the high nominal growth rate environment. We've talked about it for most of this year. It's different from what we experienced in 2010 to 2020. A lot of investors are having trouble grappling with it. Basically, it means that with the US economy growing at a nominal rate of 10% or so versus say four pre-COVID that earnings and sales growth are going to be okay. The bar is low, 2% consensus earnings growth. We think it's going to be met and cleared easily. And ultimately, at this point in the cycle, that's what we're at. We're at the Fed on one side versus earnings on the other. The Fed is pretty much fully priced in. We're now pricing in a terminal rate of 5%. Earnings are going to be okay. And look, the economy is growing. Probably going to grow 3% Q3. Yes, it will decelerate into 2023. But it's not going to be the deep recession that people fear because there's no big structural imbalance. Whether it's consumer, whether it's corporates or banks. It doesn't exist in the cycle like it did in 08-01. Matt Brill, your response. Yeah, good morning, John. I agree with most of what Jay is saying there. I think, obviously, the economy can continue to do well here. The problem is it is really like a big game of Jenga. We're eventually moving the pieces around enough. Everything is going to come falling down. So I think that we're at a state where it's not too late. The Fed is on the right path. They've been aggressive. If we can get any signs of moderation and inflation, it's not too late in the game. But if this could persist, you get another 75 in November, another 75 in December, another 75, potentially even in February of next year. That's when you get to the much more difficult period of time for corporate credit. Matt, what should I be worried about now then? Should I be worried about growth or inflection? Well, you need to be worried about inflation because if you can get inflation under control that you won't have a growth problem. And so if we can just solve the first problem, then another problem will never ever get to that point. But as long as this goes on, it gets harder and harder to do that. So for now, we got to get inflation under control. And if we can do that, everybody, we're looking at valuations are extremely attractive. So we just got to solve this inflation issue. And that's why last week CPI print, which is so disappointing. We'll get to the valuation point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3908,2022-10-17 13:06:25
15563," If we can do that, we're looking at valuations that are extremely attractive, so we just got to solve this inflation issue, and that's why last week CPI print, which is so disappointing. We'll get to the valuation point in a moment. Let's talk about the solution. Jay, to have a solution that doesn't have a growth, you need to supply side evolution. Do you see any evidence of a supply side story emerging that helps this Fed out? Oh, 100% John, and you're right on it. Look, supply chain breakage and, you know, collapse and confusion, were really the story of COVID, and that's now cleared up pretty much across the board, whether you look at, you know, ships waiting at ports or container costs coming from Asia, all that's cleaned out and out of the system. So going forward, what we have, we believe over the next several years, is a high nominal growth world driven by a global capex boom to deal with the three seas of COVID climate and conflict. And we see it in the CHIPSAC. Everybody wants a semi-fab plant in the region. We see it with the battery plants moving the rust belt to a battery belt. Everybody has to have a battery plant for EV in their region. And this is what's going to drive capex, and that's what's going to drive growth. We see it, and we've talked about it at Nazim as a analog to the second half of the 90s. We expect a productivity surge as we move away from work from home, and they pretty decent economic environment over the next several years. Something that John, virtually no one, well, recently the economists, the FTP, people were starting to talk about it. But the mindset of the market is nowhere near that. The mindset of the market is back to pre-COVID, which we don't think is at all going to be what turns out. To be fair, Jay, you were hoping for a globalized synchronized recovery. A global synchronized recovery this year, and Jay, that hasn't happened. You can see that. So can you tell me why you think that may or may not happen in the future? Yeah, no, I mean, I think at some point a while back, we were talking about that. More recently, the last six months, we've been highlighting actually John, the desynchronized global economy, both monetary policy, Fed and ECB tightening. Yes, but Bank of Japan, flat standing pat in the PBOC of China easing. So we always hear about how many rate hikes there have been. There's no talk of the fact that 50% of the biggest, most important top four central banks are not tightening. And then in terms of growth, U.S. and Europe slowing yes, but Asia is picking up whether you look at Japan, PMIs above 50, China or Southeast Asia. China's growth is going to be better in the second half than it was in the first half. So we actually, sorry to maybe confuse things a bit, but we've been talking about a desynchronized global economy as being a support. And as we come through the cycle as our other colleague just said, we come through the cycle, then we have the U.S. and Europe growing, Asia growing, and we have a global cap expoom because again, you know our trip over the world point of view. Every region, Europe, Asia, the Americas needs a semi-fab plan, needs an electric vehicle battery plan, in that public private investment, which we've seen post-COVID, now post-energy in Europe, that's the type of thing that's going to drive the global economy in the next several years. Jay, you talked about the top four central banks, three of them have got one thing in common. They're dealing with a wake of currency and the Federal Reserve is driving a much, much stronger dollar. This is what the president had to say about it. President Biden is saying, quote, I'm not concerned about the strength of the dollar. I'm concerned about the rest of the world. Our economy is strongest, how? My McKay, the problem is the rest of the world, is concerned about the strength of the dollar. Absolutely down at the IMF meetings in Washington last week, there were three villains, COVID, the Russians and the dollar, the dollar, a side effect of the Fed's inflation fight, but one that is very important to the rest of the world, you can see that strong dollar periods coincide with slow global growth. And there's an IMF report out that says we could see, in a worst case scenario, just half a percent growth. Now, a global recession is somewhere between 1 and 3%. So half a percent would be very bad news for the rest of the world. The IMF says about 60% of countries out there are in or near financial distress. Now, what happens? Well, the US obviously has higher rates, attracting global investment. It's seen as a safe haven for investors. So anything that goes wrong, people want to put their money here, which means the US exports inflation through trade, and the world pays more for commodities priced in dollars. Someone can implement Monday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3909,2022-10-17 13:11:15
15564," goes wrong, people want to put their money here. Which means the U.S. exports inflation through trade, and the world pays more for commodities priced in dollars. So there is a problem out there. There's another problem for the president, though. The strongest health thing? Maybe not. Today, Bloomberg economics put out a new report that said the chances of a U.S. recession in 2023 are 100%. It gets 60% from the Bloomberg Survey of Economists and 25% from the New York Fed. But you have to look back at when recession start at what level? The New York Fed is basically predicting recession. So our economists, it doesn't look good for strong as hell. As the Fed continues its inflation fight, Biden needs a soft landing. The Fed would like one, but it doesn't look like, at least to the economics profession, that we're going to get one. Mike McKee, thank you, sir. Let's pick up on that quote again from the president of the United States. I'm not concerned about the strength of the dollar. I'm concerned about the rest of the world. Our economy is strongest health. There's two points here. Matt, we'll let's go to the first one and then we'll get to the second one. I'm not concerned about the strength of the dollar. I'm concerned about the rest of the world. What's your response to that, Matt? Well, you know, as for the rest of the world, it's, you've obviously got issues going on in Asia. You've got issues in the UK. I mean, I think as far as the strong dollar, it never leads to a good market. It's debatable whether it leads to a good economy, but it doesn't lead to a good market. So we need the more, we need the dollar to get hit here. We need the dollar to soften up in order for risk-grassage to reverse. So I think, you know, if you can get the dollar to reverse at all, then you're going to do well, but we just haven't gotten to that point yet. And because, you know, the Fed has to keep hiking, which is going to be good for the dollar. So it's a little bit circular here, but I'm thinking, I think he's wrong with this, that he should be more concerned about this than he is. Our economy is strongest, how? Now, Matt, I guess it's a relative game and relatively speaking compared to others in my well-pay. What do you make of that statement? So he's absolutely correct. It is today. The question, will it be there in three to six months? And, you know, I still think that, you know, it comes down to this inflation expectations. And if you can get things under control, then they are out the curve expectations. You know, we saw this, you know, Michigan survey. I know you're not a huge fan of it, but seeing 500 people tell you what they think inflation is going to be over the next year, you know, whether or not that matters, I don't know. But if you look at five or five or four, there's certainly under control. So that is good. The economy is good now. And it's the second derivative is starting to take place where it's increasing at a decreasing rate. I think Biden, you know, he's got an inflation problem. He does not have a growth problem. So he's going to tout the growth as much as he can and while it exists. And right now, it still is very strong. Matt, you brought up New Mitch, so we can go there. This is not a ban me. The show's about you. You Mitch, one year inflation expectations, I believe rose to about 5.1%. Matt, it's not for me to sit here and say, I think these conversations often, I think these conversations often drift in this direction. Sit here and say what the Fed should or shouldn't do, what they should or shouldn't look at. They tell us they look at you, Mitch. Matt, they tell us they look at the EECI. They've told us they've made moves based on those two prints in the past 18 months as well. What's special about that move, Matt, getting back to 5.1%, what do you think it triggers within the Federal Reserve? Well, I think it does make them certainly cautious. And, you know, they're seeing just no signs of victory thus far. The biggest thing, the biggest takeaway is that if the Fed looks at 50 different things and not a single one of them, tell them that they're winning, then that's not good. At the end of the day, the market really only cares about the CPI brand, in my opinion. There's going to be others that matter. They're all under cards. The main event is a CPI print. And so we have to wait another four weeks until you get another CPI print. And so, you know, for me, that's what the market's going to be looking at. The Fed can tell you all these other things. But all we really want to see is some signs that things are getting better and we just haven't gotten them yet. It was an up-camp blow last week. Jay Polosky, just to find a word on this one in this segment, 75, in November from this Fed. Ah, yeah, that's a given, John. Jay Polosky, Matt Braill, sticking with us, I think everyone is on that page right now. Coming up, trouble down to the UK, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, ripping up the PM's script. There will be more difficult decisions I'm afraid on both tax and spending. The most important objective for our country right now is stability. A conversation. I'll come next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3910,2022-10-17 13:15:33
15565," A conversation. I'm next. China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get online. Bloomberg television. Top experts. Great questions. The advertiser. for our country right now is stability. This government will therefore take whatever tough decisions are necessary to do so. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt scrapping the Prime Minister's fiscal plans as Governor Bailey gets ready for a big rate hike. The very clear message I would give, and it's a clear message for everybody and clearly in its clear message for markets. I can tell you there is a very clear and immediate meeting of minds on the importance of stability and sustainability. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And as things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps fought in August. Team Cavalryd Stads, right now we're going to answer them in London alongside Lizzie Bird and Lizzie first to you. What are you turn from this government? Jeremy Hunt is absolutely new to Trustonomics here. You've had massive U-turns, more U-turns on even more of her tax cuts. And almost as humiliating, the energy bailout has been limited. So it's now going to be reviewed in April. It's going to be more in line with other European governments. Of course, it was really expensive. It was going to cost £60 billion estimated in the first six months. And what's humiliating about that is that even when Trust was having to U-turn on the top rate of income tax, corporation tax, she taunted Keir Starmer, the opposition Labour Party leader, that her energy bailout was bigger than his. And now she's kind of admitting that she's going to have to have a more targeted package so that businesses and rich households aren't having their energy bills paid for unnecessarily. The question is, do middle income households who needed help?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3911,2022-10-17 13:18:51
15566," Businesses and rich households aren't having their energy bills paid for unnecessarily. The question is, do middle income households who needed help become the baby that's thrown out with the bath water? But notably missing from all of this was a reversal on the lifting of the cap of Anker's bonuses. So we'll have to see whether that's mentioned when Jeremy Hunt makes his statement in the commons later on this afternoon. We hear from him later this afternoon and then later on this month as well. And Guy and Erlin November, we hear from the government of the Bank of England in the decision we expect to be another big rate hike. Kit Chuse of Soch Gen said goodbye. Crisis. Hello recession guy. The vigilantes win. In some ways they do Westminster is now basically being dictated to by the guilt market by the city of London, interesting relationship considering. We have seen that trade very much working in the other direction for a very long time. That's the trade right now. The Bank of England, if you look at current pricing, John, we have come back down to probably probably side circa around 100 bits at the next hike. We are probably going to get up to around five to six somewhere in the middle. Let's call it five and a half in terms of the terminal rate. It may need to be higher. The first thing that's interesting from the Chancellor today is he's gone further than maybe the fiscal whole would suggest that he needs to suggesting that there has been some damage done and he's talking about having to go even further. It's a wholesale reversal. I agree with Lizzie that the energy story is going to be an interesting aspect to all of this and the bank will have to think about that as well because that's going to limit. The demand story coming out of the UK at the moment, it will hit consumers into next year when this background starts to roll off in April. That's going to have to be factored now back into the Bank of England's thinking on how far ultimately it can go. Guy, I wonder if there's a difference between what the government wants the signal right now and what they're actually intending to do. Do you get the sense that they said April 2023 because they want a signal, maybe a tighter approach to fiscal policy over the next several months, but they're fully intending to revisit that in the months to come. I think facts will take that, John. We'll wait and see how tough this winter is. We'll wait and see what the situation looks like at the beginning of the next year. They have written a very big open check to the energy market, like so many governments have done around Europe. I suspect that this may give them actually a little bit more flexibility in terms of their ability to manage that process and be able to deal with what happens next year. I was talking to Maria today, just a moment ago. She was talking about the fact that European politicians, they can't think beyond this winter. They know that there could be a problem further down the road. But at the moment, we just need to manage what is happening here and now. Let's see what the picture looks like in April. Maybe they do need to continue with it. Maybe they don't. It's a huge problem. Lizzy, Guy, what a couple of weeks for you guys to the tour of you. Thank you. Matt Brill, the Bond Vincilante is a back in Kichuksa, Sokchen says the Bond Vincilante is win. I have to say, I mentioned this a couple of times over the last couple of weeks. I can't remember a big change like this off the back of a market move in G7. In fact, maybe you've got to go back to Bollesco, in the Italian government and the Eurozone debt crisis when he got toppled. What do you make of this, Matt? The fact we've got the Bond market, the pressure is back from the market to politicians in a way that it's been absent for much of the last 10 years. Yeah, it's great for the longer term, absolutely, for fixed income. It feels nice to have a win and the fixed income came up for once this year. But if you look related to the US, at some point here, there's going to be discussion on where the US stands physically and do they need to be tightening their belt. And I think this takes that off the table of somebody coming through with a very large tax cut or a very large spending increase. I think the buy market doesn't have to do this in the US because of what you've seen in the UK. So hopefully we can avoid some volatility down the road because I think this is the power that that that politicians need to see. And I think it's very healthy for the long term of bond market. Matt, I heard from several people in the last month or so that USIG was going to push around by what was happening with the pension industry and the crisis in the UK markets. Any truth to that? Matt, and what does it mean now that the UK Chancellor has come out and done what he's done? Yeah, it did. And in a simplest form, there wasn't enough long duration assets for UK pensions to buy so they used some synthetics in order to do it that caused leverage and then they got off sides on that. But they had also bought though because they couldn't buy it in the UK was they bought long duration assets in the US. And so they were buying long duration corporate credit and they had to sell it and it was one of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3912,2022-10-17 13:23:54
15567," So what they had also bought though, because they couldn't buy it in the UK, was they bought long duration assets in the US. And so they were buying long duration corporate credit, and they had to sell it. And it was one of the few things they could actually get liquidity on in a short period of time. So we were seeing massive VWIX coming out for folio trades that were being done billion dollars at a time. That were the market, or the dealers just weren't ready for it, and they didn't want to absorb it. So it really put a lot of pressure on corporate credit. Once we've got a little bit of reprieve over there, it's helped us. So for now, we've got 99 problems, but guilds aren't one of them. But it's finally to the point where we're not selling off because of them. In fact, you've got a 40 basis point plus move and long end guilds today, which is not healthy or not normal, but we'll take it for today. We just want some stability out of there, and then we can get back to trading where we think we should be on our own merit. I'm not sure Jay-Z thought he was getting a shout out in the corporate and sovereign debt market this morning. Jay, I want to finish on Europe with you. You and I have talked about it together for so, so long, so many years. Guy's point on tightening up the duration of assistance to offset the pain in the energy market. And now it's only going to April 2023. Jay, the commitment of these governments in Europe to support the electorate through a difficult time. And you worried about the duration of it considering this is going to go on potentially for more than one winter. No, not at all, John. Look, we're big fans of what's happening in Europe, and I think part of the issue for the UK is, you know, life post-Brexit is not easy. It's a small economy. It's a relatively unimportant economy. It's on its own, and it suffers as a result when it makes a policy mistake in markets react. It's really been what we call the two weeks ago, a tempest and a tea pot. For Europe more broadly, look, all this is driving further integration. Now you're talking about Europe doing a unified missile defense shield. I mean, things that were unthinkable even two years ago. So we continue to be very constructive on Europe on a medium-term basis. Anybody with strategic money to deploy over a three, five-year basis? Europe is trading the currency's 40% cheap stocks. Have never been cheaper versus the US. Integration is progressing a pace. They have more fiscal support than the US. It's already pre-baked and is going to continue. And look, I think we're moving towards a Europe that issues debt in its own as a unified union. And as that happens, that's very constructive for the Europe. That's very constructive for fiscal responsibility within Europe. And I think, to me, Europe, I said it before, and I continue to believe it, Europe has a chance to win the decade of the 2020s, particularly when you look at Asia and where the US is. I'm going to find what you just said. Please do, I've said it many times. We big fans. What's happening in Europe? J. Polosky, I'll frame it, and then we'll replay it in a few months' time. J. Polosky, Matt, real try to. Come here, buddy. You want two years? You can have a couple of years. Coming up the morning calls and later, thanks for America, the latest report results, that conversation with Ken Leon of C-F-R-A and Pincos Errin Brown, just around a corner. Later, let's go.

I mean, the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. We thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance, and do that because we used sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different factor than what the rest in the industry were doing.

It pushes to market across the country because they are very likely to gain state border on those Hong Kong market, particularly in West Trier. This week is from when the bank will not protect the bank but today, thick and equities, meat or beef expectations, and so trading coming in above expectations, even some weakness being seen there in some credit and mortgage products. How that fair is tomorrow for Goldman Sachs is of key interest because we're going to want to see them punch high on equities after what we saw at Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan kind of missing expectations there and fixed income coming in strong across the board. Shifting over to Goldman Sachs, of course that big news this morning about another reorganization around the corner, they have their earnings tomorrow as well. Key changes being unwound, they're emerging again asset and wealth because the wealth customer of course has a slightly different profile but consumer banking businesses will be in a bit of a separate region here in the bank of the platform services area being created at the bank run by Stephanie Cohen according to Bloomberg's reporting. So the big key question here is fine, you have a reorganization at play but what will this mean for the high hopes that David Solomon has hoped to hit four billion dollars in consumer revenue by 2024? They're expected to meet 2.3 billion this year. Will he change his expectations as he addresses analysts tomorrow is a key question. And Shandee what am I more interested in tomorrow than numbers or the man delivering them? The man delivering them and it's not just the man himself. This is year four of his tenure, John. We're getting very, very close to year five of his tenure. This is a part of the history here for David Solomon where you start to take note. If you come in above expectations on returns on equity consistently, their bank however is trading below book value, how does he get the multiple that many of his rivals are getting is the investment bank simply not enough for Goldman's acts to give investors what they want. Shandee looking forward to your coverage through tomorrow. Shandee Bassett will be on with us on Bloomberg's surveillance. We break down those numbers for you. Sticking with us on the banks is Ken Leon of CFRA. He joins us now Ken. It was fortunate to catch up with you last week we get to do it again this morning. Which of you on Goldman, the leadership, the direction of travel as we go into tomorrow numbers? Yeah, so analysts are still listening to Bank of America but top of mine is Goldman's sacks. And for Goldman, I really think James Gorman and Morgan Stanley has a shuffle here. He's got the right strategy. Goldman just reached too far trying to get scale from nowhere in consumer banking. And obviously that has a good long term opportunity, but they can't bring it to revenues or profitability. Gorman, of course, acquired an e-trek gets the workforce they're able to get into different segments of wealth. And the market as Chaneli mentions pays a higher multiple for principal businesses or",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3915,2022-10-17 13:38:26
15570," force they're able to get into different segments of wealth. And the market, as Chaneli mentioned, pays a higher multiple for principal businesses or recurring revenue. An unfortunately investment banking is going to be challenging through next year for Goldman and others. And they're essentially combining businesses with trading so that they can begin to cut costs. So Ken, what are you saying? You said it's the wrong strategy. You said they should have brought this. They shouldn't have done it organically. Does Marcus need to go? Ken, what are you saying they should do? So Goldman is always a brilliant, best in class, but they basically have an agency businesses. And they see others like BlackRock or Shwag, or even Blackstone, enjoy the benefits of scale and recurring revenue in a very cyclical business, which will be down through next year's investment banking. They don't have the number one wealth business as Morgan Stanley has, or the broad scale that Bank of America has and commercial and consumer lending, or JP Morgan. We have buys on Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. We took Goldman Sachs from a strong buy down to a whole over a month ago just feeling that the agency business is just not going to come around. And it's a big leap to say that you can have a slightly higher rate to a consumer that's a spender or a saver, but not yet an investor for the long-term trend. That was a really a tough strategy. Ken, Bank of America right now is up by more than 5%. Can I just ask you for these big banks like BFA, a higher interest rates good or bad for them in the next 12 months? We stay with Bank of America because, essentially, if you have a large high-quality loan book, you can sit back and enjoy rising rates. But obviously the risk is any cracks or severe recession next year. We will have recession if it's not severe. What Bank of America said is we're going to add another 1.25 billion of net interest income in the fourth quarter. So that was always part of the bold case which was rising rates. But unfortunately next year, economy is going to slow down and that makes it a little more tenuous. And then the capital markets, we like, and I think a lot of portfolio managers like regional banks over the large banks because of geopolitical risk and also underperforming and investment banking. Ken, what we're used to in a recession is a central bank kind of interest rates. And when we back test and look at how these banks respond to downturns and economic growth, usually that's supplemented by interest rates being cut at the Federal Reserve. Ken, have you given thought to a cycle where we get a recession? The Fed doesn't cut and what that actually means for the banks this time around? So they will then be part of perhaps, you know, a new bull market or recovery of the economy. And we're not there yet. And, you know, there's a generational rise of inflation. Many investors have not been around since we've seen the 1970s or 80s. And the Fed's credibility is at line. So I think, you know, we're looking at 75 basis points in November, maybe December. And, you know, that's the challenge. I think a lot of us hope that the Fed will ease. But, you know, there's a lot more work to be done. And unfortunately, that's not great for the financial sector. There are banks until we see them pause. Ken, awesome to hear from you this morning. Thank you, sir. Ken Lee on there of CFRA. Bank for America, positive by 4.7%.

I think that the market right now is just coming off of, you know, very strong weakness over the past week. We see a little bit of a relief rallied this morning. But I wouldn't extrapolate that this is, you know, going to last a very long time. I still think that there's significant challenges ahead as we turn the corner into early next year that the market hasn't digested yet. Earnings estimates are too high. Margin's expectations are too high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3916,2022-10-17 13:41:12
15571," significant challenges ahead as we turn the corner into early next year that the market hasn't digested yet. Earnings estimates are too high, margins expectations are too high, and I don't think that equities are still, you know, singing the same from the same him book that we see in the fixed income markets. You saw a very negative reaction last week on the CPI print and sort of follow on into Friday, and I think what you're seeing is that the market is still fearful of higher inflation and still believes that higher inflation is going to lead to or accelerate a recession. And I think that that's the challenge that the market's still facing that we, you know, will see unfold over the next couple of months. So I still think that there's about 10% downside from current levels to S&B 500. Aaron, in the midterm, is there some upside at all? In the very near term, because Mike Wilson and Wilkins Stanley shares your view. And ultimately, there's more downside here and maybe we could get down to 3400. But he wrote this this morning. He said the 200-week moving average is a serious floor of support until companies fully confess or recession officially arrives, both of which could take several more months and lead to a technical rally in the short term. Aaron, you give me your fundamental thesis. What about your more technical, tactical thesis about the short term, the scope for an upside-move here? I think... Yeah, I mean, I definitely think that there's scope for upside-move. A lot of people are pointing to that 200-day moving average. On top of that, earnings expectations for this quarter are quite muted. There's only, you know, sort of low single-digit earnings expectations. While earnings have been coming in slightly weaker than expected, you know, the bar isn't that high. And so, you know, going into what typically is a very strong seasonal quarter, which is the fourth quarter, and into, you know, a fairly muted earnings season. There's certainly potential for upside, but, you know, it's hard to time that, and I would be fading or selling into any of that upside-move that you see in the market on what I think is largely a technicality. What's going to lead you to drop your neutral stance on duration, away from the equity market, Aaron? I think we're getting closer to that point. I think you really need to see a couple of things happen to get more bullish duration. The first would be to see inflation really peak and have a credible path lower for inflation because, you know, there's been sort of three times now where we've had these headfakes with respect to inflation peaking, and yet we've been met with this appointment. And so, I think until we see credible signs that inflation is really moving lower, it's going to be hard to really, you know, put your neck out there and buy duration and size. But given the valuation levels, given these real yield levels that we're seeing today, it is arguably a pretty attractive alternative to other asset classes. I mean, if you think about it, historically, your starting point for yield today is what the market should bear over the next 10 years or so. So given, you know, the starting point of 4.4% on the two year and just below 4% on 10 years, that's a pretty good return that you're getting from cash and duration over the next 10 years. I'll be it with volatility in the near term. Aaron, just a final question on that. I hear a lot of people say, raise cash, stay defensive. With a benefit of hindsight, that's super useful 12 months ago. Aaron, there's people watching this now who just don't want to monetize the losses. This deep into the hole. How do they raise cash? I mean, I think that we're still going to see downside from equities from here. So I think taking money here out of the market and putting it in 4% to your paper still makes sense. And I think that, you know, alternatively looking at high investment grade corporates that are also yielding, you know, a 6%, 7% yield also makes sense staying, you know, shorter term in duration. But if you expect more downside from here, yes, it's painful. Use that to tax, tax loss harvest and, you know, cycle that money back into products that can earn a sustainable yield and return over the next six to 12 months while you weight it out. Aaron, also I'm here from you, as always, Aaron Brown, there of PIMCO. You're actually market about 11 or 12 minutes into the session up by 2.8% or so on the S&P.

His S&P 500 price target getting chopped, chopped, chopped from 4800 down to 4K. We'll get to it next. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. Anytime I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. One of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. What we can see in the economic data is the Fed is focused on bringing out inflation and the big concern is can they bring down inflation while maintaining robust economy labor market. And we are starting to see signs that the actions they are taking is having an effect. Division down at DC, Theroy says the Biden administration back in the Fed saying its policies are starting to work. Senator Bernie Sanders saying a different picture. I think they're hurting the situation. I think it is wrong to be saying that the way we're going to deal with inflation is by lowering wages and increasing unemployment. The inflation thing is a real issue. It is a global issue. But at a time when working families are struggling and the people on top are doing phenomenally well, I don't think you go after working.

15573," The working PC. My McKee with us here in New York City. My McKee, the usual suspects may be. Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, but ultimately we're expecting more of this, aren't we? Yeah, it's starting to be a debate in economic circles as well as people start to think about what could happen. It's not happened yet, but Bernie Sanders has some support, particularly among progressive economists. Claudia Samu, you've heard of her. She's a fairly grumpy about things right now. She says the world's bad and will worsen at home and abroad before it gets better, time for the Fed to do the right thing and slow down. Is the Fed going to do that? Well, not what they're telling us. It does suggest, I mean in the past, that there is a danger of what Bernie Sanders and Claudia Samu are talking about because when the Fed raises interest rates, unemployment goes up, we go into recession. The Fed so far raising interest rates, though, and it hasn't happened. That's the dilemma for the Fed. They believe that people are better off if they bring down inflation, even at the lower end because while people are making more money, they are not making enough to keep up with inflation. So if inflation comes down, then everybody is better off. And so that's the goal for the Fed going forward. They're going to watch the unemployment rate, but they think it'll only go to 4.4%. That isn't very much by historical standards and it may be about normal. We may have a tighter labor market than people think. So it's something that has to play out over many months now, but it is definitely a growing debate, particularly down in Washington. We're going to have this conversation a whole lot more, going into the midterms, knock down in the next couple of weeks. We might be key there here in New York City. A great work might, last week in DC, more bills throwing in the towel, kinder. And they're going to get to the kinder in a moment. But up on him is John Stoffers, was it 4,800 year end? He's chopped that down to 4,000. Now, his price target now is 4,000 year end. And I'm happy to say that he's given us a bit of time this morning to talk about it. John, great to catch up, sir. Thanks for taking the time to be with us. So let's start here. You know, I've talked about this a few times over the last few months. What was the straw that broke the camel's back on this one? I really think it has simply been that we have seen repeatedly these rallies that we've had that have been remarkably powerful based on the negativity that's out there. And then they weren't sustainable, and it's simply weren't sustainable because the issues at hand, whether it's monetary policy, generally more aggressive stance and committed stance by the Fed to curb inflation, as well as political dysfunction in Washington and broad, the geopolitical stuff, supply chains that won't are still not quite up to pre-pandemic levels. All this gives pressure and concern to the market. So what we've got to think is 12 percent upside from here to the end of the year makes a lot more sense than almost 33 percent upside based on where the S&P closed on Friday. So we're still bullish on equities. It's just going to take more time until the Fed has effect on curbing inflation because those last numbers from last week, the 30-year mortgage yield last week going up again, just doesn't look like it's had effect yet. We believe it will have effect, but not yet. John, you and I have talked about this and discussed it through the year. You know, not everyone gets the year right. That's just part of the game sometimes, but John, you've got a dead wrong. And I just wonder what you feel like you did get wrong and didn't learn from quickly enough. As you reflect on this year and think about the years to come, how will you and the team grow from it? Well, the first thing I'd remind you, John, we've been pretty accurate over the, most of the 10 years that I've been here at Oppenheimer since 2012 in terms of the direction of the S&P 500 except for 2015, 2018 and this year. So not a bad record. And last year our target was 4700, the S&P closed 4776, as I recall. This year we got it wrong very simply. We could not have expected the Russians incursion into Ukraine, zero COVID tolerance by China that closed down the city of Shanghai and the city of 25 million people, plus the effects of overstimulation by the Fed and by politicians, so just couldn't let go of the fiscal policy. The reason I asked, John, is because 2015 was a down year. And that's the economic report. So And this year, people said, put on coyote, your commission is again very fariser, entirely a position that we have and that you don't need to explain. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3919,2022-10-17 13:54:47
15574," I have the Fed and by politicians, so just couldn't let go of the fiscal policy. The reason I asked, John, is because 2015 was a down year. 2018 was a down year. And what worked last year was just being bullish and strong. And what worked for the last decade was to be bullish and strong. And John, I just wonder if we'll all adapt into a new market regime, a real change. Well, the big regime is it's the end of free money. And the end of free money means you're de-labouraging and a wide variety of areas that have inflated the valuations of things like meme stocks, cyber currencies, as well as even core assets like equities, bonds, real estate, and a number of other assets. When you take out the leverage that the Federal Reserve has enabled and the largest of politician stimulus, it means that things become a move back to reality. It doesn't mean stocks can't move higher. It doesn't mean companies can't earn money, but there's a puritive of adjustment that we've witnessed here that is taking longer. You know, when you look at the Fed, the Fed has raised what, five times so far and still has had very little effect on the rate of inflation. And that's where we are. The market's responding to that. John, 300 basis points of six months is a lot. You have a lot of... I'm in a small period of time, I get that. But I just want to really sort of hit home on this and you and I can talk about it in the future as well, because we don't have too much time. But being married to a world view in the last 10 years generated some real gains. And if you were just along the whole decade, you would have been down in 15, it was a down year, 18. It was down year. Now, I feel like... Sure, it was a flat year, slightly negative, by about 7, 10, to 1%. It was actually positive. We cannot do it over the details, John. Be aware I'm going with this. I'm just wondering whether the permaballs have got to rethink their world view based on what's happened over the last 9, 10 months? I'd say we were not permaballs, but rather we were just... We're positive on a pretty obvious situation. In terms of moving forward, we'd think past performance would... No guarantee future performance would suggest that once the market gets used to this new regime of a world in which bond issuers have to pay for the privilege of borrowing money. Yep. And bond buyers get paid for the risks they take. And that moves through the credit facilities, of course, the facts, equity returns. The market is likely to return to a more positively adjusted basis. You know, I've been doing this for 39 years, so I can remember where interest rates were all out higher than they are now. Bonds were yielding yields much higher than now. And stocks were moving up. Hey, John, credit to you for coming on with us this morning. I appreciate you know that. We're going to have a longer conversation in the future. John, thank you, sir. John Starfost, there, of Oppenheimer from New York. This is Plain Pack.

15576," He'd gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year, and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners, and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands, and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America, and that extends to their love for soft drinks, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success, and so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. A million pesos or $6,000,000 doesn't sound like a lot now, but in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100, so a million pesos was well beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away, all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi's sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine. Just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3922,2022-10-17 14:06:40
15577," Thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands, were finding winning bottle caps. 349, 349. Some people had 10 lucky 349 bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps, but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted a million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband Role. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Role told me that he'd never remarried. He'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. He was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. When I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. I was in order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3923,2022-10-17 14:11:06
15578," That's this. Delphiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps. And he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Delphiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees. But for people who couldn't afford the money, he would just represent them pro bono. I learned that thing. He sued that broker. I'm Becky. And for people who might be the food. So he had mounted on that phone. The thing that we had. We didn't do that. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrant. Handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch, one for the fight. And another heating for the branch, one for 138, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's was hospital. To do heart failure, still he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise. For not attending the judge, will issue water to the next one of the father. My father passed away January 13, 2010, after staying for almost one year in the hospital. He died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this. But they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments. But the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience. By that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3924,2022-10-17 14:15:40
15579," Music When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as a coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. It was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered mine at the attack was sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages. And the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate and be sort of isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions, the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3925,2022-10-17 14:19:52
15580," Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV. There was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Johannes were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something is right here. The person to make money off of that had required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for paulers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingan. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina Goe. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only as Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. He noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down, and he believed that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3926,2022-10-17 14:24:29
15581," It is that in the aftermath of the attack the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borseer Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sege, Benagolud didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. Some of that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero though.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3927,2022-10-17 14:28:34
15582," If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero, though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there that we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous on Earth. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence as a state, right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environment, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäger-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority of more than 90% of all the really large 1 kilometer near-Earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-Earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-Earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3928,2022-10-17 14:33:15
15583," sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids, based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is fairly quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this has a business. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous. That when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. They'll even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it the potential impactor. And then you can calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface. You calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare this all the other asteroids in the in the solar system. And then you can use the same calculations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. And then you have to calculate the data of calculating in a fraction of a second. Whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on. For for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids time is critical.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3929,2022-10-17 14:37:55
15584," When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead at an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can simply hop into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about. Just nudge it out of its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft. It's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object. And you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer, though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting a pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the night sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and climate change, is a problem with the global confidence. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he lots of small satellites around the earth that are always going and looking out for it. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence at stake, right? The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some pass the time by baking. The whole main sourdough bread.

15585," The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Homemade sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my letsis in. But for millions of others... I'm going to be posting stocks that will... Boom! They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Let's just lock it on up and take 50,000 dollars. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up. And then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailer GameStop has set to continue their headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This isn't a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok Fin influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market. And that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating, where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customers Robinhood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddilities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well sized, the shapes, the colors, all of that is some.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3931,2022-10-17 14:46:17
15586," user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning, how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones and between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between old and old. And the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young people, I think it's a good idea to have a good time. I'm stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. If you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or means. You know, people telling rumors to each other to bid around for a hundred years on Wall Street information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3932,2022-10-17 14:50:25
15587," The network effect, it would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to to larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential to us understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin biotech risk cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that's the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society. I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at said price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could say it and listen to you all day and I was like, the this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a L G O word because TikTok listens to us. Algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life, nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around and where people are sticking around, Reddit and it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street's bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street bets adopted a 4chan like etiquette leading to their tagline like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stock news and we would be grasping for why stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day and you would look at Wall Street bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of you know squared the circle so to speak and started making sense and it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this.

Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory roles of institution aren't as powerful as maybe the institutions let them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the vast interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFPs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar, they come in and they're in the same business but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3935,2022-10-17 15:03:30
15590," Music Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now, his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. Like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus, as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded, and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work, because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy, has awful internet. It's usually under two down, and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second, and symmetrical, is running at about 119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extremes, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody saw",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3936,2022-10-17 15:07:48
15591," a venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area. And it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out, all they got was dial up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started, and now that we are remote learning with our children, and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day, when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socio-economic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up in large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of CONCAST, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits and so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. CONCAST released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee.

15592," One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city but there is city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. Historically, the marginalized people you call them as untouchables are the leads. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, you know, source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rank of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langan or social welfare residential schools. So totally, about 400 schools I managed, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. My friends also have 60% of girls and then 40% of boys because girls are more marginalized among them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3938,2022-10-17 15:16:11
15593," For that? Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys. Because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Talk to the parents, talk to the teachers, talk to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, they challenge us both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have? In the seriums, very good night class. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation. And language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. The result of the decision is also, as the answer is, I have a good view. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think, or that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that. But that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero. Swero and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is that your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, I am a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I mean, Swero, I want to be a very good actor or, you know, a magician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form labourer, a parent's, the angels of agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo-D campus, and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression.

15594," fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. There are a lot of extracurricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So for example, music. We have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, and Brazilian academy. We have handball academy. So we have Kabadi, traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced goldfalls. Goldfeeds are generally played by rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people are being trained in gold in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees of opportunities to the students. So that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and do. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally. Because the poor people have been programmed to be victims. Program to be subjugated. Program to be on the margins. Program to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country. To put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are directly involved on these people. Vestereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. In those days I was talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for social care and so on. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people from a very young age. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people from a very young age. I think that's going to be a game changer for the poorest of the poor people from a very young age. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3940,2022-10-17 15:24:48
15595," If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of seven degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that calls water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers and exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then excess a bit's climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017 researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat because of the shading effect of course and deep psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3941,2022-10-17 15:29:24
15596," It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan-Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people, and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces, now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof-scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants, which functions as a community park, and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls, and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect, but on the other hand, it's also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building, in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy, and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally, the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city. And you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore, unfortunately, this is a limited option, but in the long run, it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore. If all the roofs and the areas on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin, or duct. That will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them. And if they test very well and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development system that it already has.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3942,2022-10-17 15:33:39
15597," So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combined this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Time's a tough job. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. Seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything so I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later I made another one and that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3943,2022-10-17 15:38:07
15598," Then everyone else you either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works Which is very similar to Google Analytics then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else then why should in one watch your channel So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways One which is the bulk of it which is ad revenue Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner And then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or The video starts immediately you get the little banner ads at the bottom or If you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount it varies on lots of things like the country Of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it The time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a Reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 Companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every 1,000 views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents So every thousand views I made 30 cents But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content Some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars and There's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February That's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos In that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they gonna make content that instead? You're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher The second way that a YouTuber makes income is Support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off patreon was really the only option But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a Special icons next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the Third aspect of that would be merch and For me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an Auto mod bans you You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do Then it's not worth it Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh Sweet I Guess I can make the channel about that Now how do I grow an audience? Do I get popular? You learn it's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following you have to have a massive Instagram following You have to have a massive YouTube following of course you have to be on twitch, which is the key platform But basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience It is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms It's me and then playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3944,2022-10-17 15:42:32
15599," it back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have the right to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used in EC in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh no. You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with other audience. There were those weird like Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. All right, throw on a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera, like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point. Because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff. Because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. Thanks for coming to my Conference.

15600," This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Via and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-ing, the sister app of TikTok. I think it has changed the way of the people around us. In fact, you can also see that you can't buy all the products you've been buying. Of course, you can buy it only if you see it. It's not about only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So, it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing. And China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving purchase currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So, it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So, with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is I didn't know. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction, whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say call this number or something. But live streaming shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference. It causes different psychology and live streaming shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So, it's very convenient. Cowbow, one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms, owned by tech giant Alibaba. Added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold by a live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. The millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people desecrate interacting with you. And the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3946,2022-10-17 15:51:05
15601," creates an interesting kind of environment that these people decends that I'm actually interacting with you. And then the livestream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in the sense of a music control, especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargings from retailers, which in turn means you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of livestreaming, Viya, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of her platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once, so they rock her launch in her livestreaming room for 40 million yuan. Next, we really want to sell my money. The king Vi Li Jiaqi, I widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into livestreaming e-commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipstick on himself when he's on the show. Top livestreamers like Viya and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking livestreamers like Tiffany still earn a good income through sales commissions. If I say that from the beginning, the main character of the show is much better than the main character. But the main character of the show is the body and the spirit of the show. Every day, you need to be in a rush and then you have to be in a long, 5-6 hours. This is very tiring. And if you have to be in a 5-6 hours, your brain is not working. And your mouth is not working. Your hands are not working. Your eyes are not working either. Like we did in the first episode, we didn't just do one thing. And we still have some options. And we still have some other things in the show. Actually, there's no other people living. I think the main character of the show is not about the whole thing. Maybe the thing you did in the last episode was the main character. And it's about the content of the show that you can't tell the story. It's about the trust. If you don't have a horse, you can't get a horse. If you don't like it, you can buy it. A lot of successful livestreamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what a product does, what a product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy, and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic. So for Via and Li Chasi, they're able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chasi will sometimes say bad things about certain products. Because to him, there's his honest opinion. And sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible. They seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chasi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications, the models in a 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bars, we're going to interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just shouldn't eat bad news, and show it to the community. Live streamers also use cell techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something because social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat, and they ask questions. And they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds, have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3947,2022-10-17 15:55:55
15602," Farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own livestream shows. Working with very top tier livestreamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand, so we see company executives opening their own shows. We see PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the livestreaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. Livestream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its livestreaming function. And interactive features like chat rooms, companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, the livestreaming has started to become a topic that has been developing for a long time. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the chassis is number alone. You know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with a livestreaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to a commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricization generation. From all下去, winds and wind along the bridge of various healthcare machines.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3948,2022-10-17 15:59:58
15603," of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steady pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough. So this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpit project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koeiversari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Waverola, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Waverola has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Waverola has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Waverola, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American content as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3949,2022-10-17 16:03:59
15604," on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American content as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company ECO Wave Power is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded ECO Wave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables, we install on existent man-made structures, and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the ECO Wave Power Conversion Unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders, which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here, and in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100-kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3950,2022-10-17 16:08:31
15605," casting commissioning regs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where you know people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale or any sort of... Please make me do it. You know what? You're my husband. I mean, you're a bit so far away. One of the most dramatic elements was Ravinder Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared me. You scared Machiavellian. I love these interesting words. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that it's chairman that has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gão. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail, regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gão. And he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Ravinder Passe. I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front rose seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gão saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3951,2022-10-17 16:12:23
15606," He was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero, and now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gone was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gone. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays, and one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone. And he was told get to the heart of the matter, find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Huddy? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3952,2022-10-17 16:16:56
15607," Oh. Harry Nader was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him, or did have a long-standing relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had done so about the credibility of the process, right at the start. Harry Nader had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now, that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing, or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nader had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability, and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gowne. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revender Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman's been arrested. A representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, when they shouldn't have. I mean, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys, when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something. Because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So, Rob Passey makes a fateful move.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3953,2022-10-17 16:21:20
15608," So Rob Passey makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened that often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the going executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to Vice President at the global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and harinata. What happened to Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. In that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grave and small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan security department behave in a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people there? Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the district court in Yokohama. To basically do a search and of his home and seizure of his property in a corporate lab.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3954,2022-10-17 16:26:01
15609," basically do a search and of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again I just couldn't understand or what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry not is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. If the confidential company email, right, you should not have to be a little bit more honest. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. But in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And, yeah, you've got to be ready for it. If you take it on anyway. That's the only matter. you you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3955,2022-10-17 16:29:50
15610," You This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet at the end of the day. It's a scene to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Chautenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chautenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. I included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chautenstein kind of retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not theorize or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3956,2022-10-17 16:34:31
15611," Very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part, and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time, Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son, who lived in the condominium below her, came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead, and just started sitting at the kitchen table, just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back, through the back door, and they brought this shredder inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroyed papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And it's a diary, and she started writing. Each day, she would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package, and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi, and in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box, and that her son, Bobby, had the key to that box, and that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a memento will and trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken, the only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone, but why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And they ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Don is there and up comes Bob, you're kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating them and he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. It was horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months to hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3957,2022-10-17 16:39:19
15612," hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his son's weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. It seems that it's really resonating with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with Kramer. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before. They crashed into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. Lots of people in the market were saying, well, hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3958,2022-10-17 16:43:12
15613," Later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts of play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. When the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions, Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually in their 20s and they're drinking buddies son or their own kids, friends from football. Their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. Fairly shortly he's got maybe a dozen or so traders that are independent, let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective. I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to get into it. Wait as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, a guy which you style accent. They're not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. But you know these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves, they went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Faden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheebride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You know you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glencores but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very different.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3959,2022-10-17 16:47:47
15614," It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. But a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall, which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at once. So they're going to be able to buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened, which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for, enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office, it was a very, very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader, you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks. And you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't. And they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old. You know, only a few years earlier he'd been posted on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3960,2022-10-17 16:52:18
15615," of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrate it as heroes in the trading community that they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that you know we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on and the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory and a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost-effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3961,2022-10-17 16:59:31
15616," to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost-effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions. And we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the nature conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the nature conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI, the civilized Disney World this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up. Diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3962,2022-10-17 17:03:56
15617," So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're drive which they've had for decades to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney that didn't want to be interviewed for this story. But they all told us that look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there if the rules are too strict then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent you have policymakers but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions and so the policies end up by useing the whole system and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. And it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years you have to start wondering is it really just a distraction and that's really unfortunate but that's where we are. Similarly what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3963,2022-10-17 17:08:16
15618," To change what and how we eat, you know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop has a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. It's a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3964,2022-10-17 17:12:35
15619," an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept, and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop System in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Lucha, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment or in spaces, and there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial, be like a sports car. Yeah, we got to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run, it's about 500 yards or so, and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be funding some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlubs will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over 10 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability that afforded to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3965,2022-10-17 17:17:10
15620," Game-changing platform here. Those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. In visioning the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, those are fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev, and 1,000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck college off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlups will still need to use",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3966,2022-10-17 17:21:15
15621," off the roads, that itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlubes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverging from one track into two, that makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track into two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network, but in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent, and take Europe for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. The lane switch on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. The in a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems, already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects, we're talking about integration into the environment, we're talking about the social aspects, to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects, and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant, and that they need to contribute to bring these two markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3967,2022-10-17 17:25:45
15622," And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperlip development, heart in 2018 partnered with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada, the goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies run Europe create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. The next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial. If hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple hyperlip companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube. The in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that you know the Wright Brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our route. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details and I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3968,2022-10-17 17:29:57

This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage? why the universe's most abundant element could be a game-changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new, they are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it. Yeah. Plus the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. For Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kaylee Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change and one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around but could well be a game-changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize but it has far more uses as well from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called gray hydrogen dominates today but as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change.

15624," We'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from iron ore to hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility companies Svamm about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water, or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero, but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates the zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of his annual profits for green energy investments, and his exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laquah caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, look in there and say, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3970,2022-10-17 17:38:52
15625," Click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. No, it's transition line is complete rubbish that I got put to it. Two days ago when JCB really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB and Forescue, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything sick well from Forescue, huge balance sheet, sick strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on Green with Per Adam, right, then that's a real wake up call to say hang on. Green Hatchin is obviously commercial now. Every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel Hatchin, it can compete with it on price, it can probably lose on price but what we know it is cooking the planet. And only Green Hatchin zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment we're not even phasing out coal if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using Green Hatchin. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue Hatchin is cooking the planet. You know, you have to do it to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let mine the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of Green washing. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for e-sug investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there was a strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on Green Hatchin that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra seriously that Green Hatchin is never here to stay, it's broken through, the history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Oh, because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. Do you stop funding, do you stop subsidising, do you stop using money into possibly? Okay, it could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates, it could be anything, hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, because we haven't had that Green Hatchin, it's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also excuses, I'd never be commercial, it'll never be supplied in the quantities we needed, I'm glad, now we know, let's take action, it's practical, it's implementable, let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person, 8 to B is the solution, let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do, just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest, because they don't measure methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon, but at least the carbon has been done honestly, encourage the Green Hatchin sector to come in really fast, it's there, there's renewable power all over the world, we know how to make electrolyzes, much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost, we know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3971,2022-10-17 17:43:15
15626," Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper and it's getting more check. It's the only fuel you know. Mr. Froscher. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. Ah yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it's policy is all over the world. To appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. Let's spread it everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Blueburg Green. From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Blueburg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that high-level pace is way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power.

Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Cossera coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so called hard to abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,010,600. Today, 100, and we see it going down to 50 in five years time and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a court of word as today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind, can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships, in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So, and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Where is the price? Buy it? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling costs of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel, to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there. And we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects. And that's where companies take us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM, they're speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3973,2022-10-17 17:52:16
15628," We're now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day, it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus ASEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets, and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident, but we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time, and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over one gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date, nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg any F expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green. Bhau C.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3974,2022-10-17 17:56:35
15629," music From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaby Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annix. Our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant costs of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. So let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to store ability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from the Suix edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate.

15630,".... market's headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg dot com the Bloomberg business app and at Bloomberg quick tape. This is a Bloomberg business flash. From the world, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Pettlet. We're looking at US stocks at or near session highs. The Dow, the S&P, Nezdaq very much risk on stocks climbed after the S&P 500 breached a technical level that has triggered gains in the past. Risk appetite him proving as more of UK Prime Minister Liz Trusses unfunded tax cuts were reversed. Now the breadth of this rally is so strong that at one point over 99% of companies in the S&P 500 were rising with the gauge pushing away from its 200 week moving average. So here's where we stand. The S&P now up by 101 points up 2.8%. Again, very close to session highs. The Dow now up by 620 points up 2.1%. And Nezdaq is up 362. That is a gain of 3.5%. We've got the 10 year yielding 3.99%. The 2 year 4.45% spot gold of $8.00 the ounce to 16.52 of 5.10% of 1% West Texas, and immediate crude flat on the day now at 85.62. A barrel. As for the overall inflation outlook and the Federal Reserve, Kate Phantas is president and chief investment officer at CT Mason. This inflation number is very tricky. We actually saw a hot inflation number last week. But I think in the end inflation may prove to be transitory. And the Fed will have proven to have overstocked. This is going to affect a lot of things. You see what's in stone to the dollar, which is affected US exporters. You see what it's done to the equity markets. And that is what I'm going to be looking at. And again, we've got the 10 year yielding 3.99% stocks higher across the board, bank stocks among the standouts. After earnings, bank of America up 6.5%, we've got the CEO coming up in about 39 minutes right here on Bloomberg. JP Morgan Chase up 4.7% city group up 1.2%. And that is a Bloomberg business flash. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine. Plus global business, finance and tech news, as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Massier and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Well folks, we've got a new week and definitely a new tone at least on this Monday. Very good afternoon. Life in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. We are streaming on YouTube. It is Monday, October 17. Check this out Tim. A broad based rally. Yeah, one point nearly all names in the S&P 500. We're rising. We're going to have more on the markets. That's what we call really, really, really broad based. So everything's fine, right? We're out of the woods. Everything is awesome. Everything's awesome. Except for that high inflation print. Exactly. Exactly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3976,2022-10-17 18:05:08
15631," more on the markets. That's what we call really, really, really broad-based. So everything's fine, right? We're out of the woods. Everything is awesome. Everything's awesome. Except for that high inflation print. I would high inflation print. Exactly. All right, another day, Tock full of Big Bank earnings. We're going to be hearing from the Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan, live on our air in just about 30 minutes. And on the subject of Big Banks, we've got another reorgate Goldman Sachs. We're going to have the latest on that. Another. Plus, President Xi charting China's next course in domestic companies that trade here in the US, they are rallying. Most speaking of the US, did I give it away? The one country that did buyers are cutting wood. We need the way out of market turmoil. I'm sorry. Do you know anything about a tease? All right, just pretend you didn't hear me give it all away. All right, we're also going to catch up with the Fort Worth Mayor, Matti Parker, and everything from Transplants moving in, the crypto boom, and the upcoming governors race a lot to get to. First up, let's get to the Market Drivers report. Let's set your business week agenda with us here in our studio, Kriegup, the Anchor and Market's course, on an app, Bloomberg, along with Emily Grafayow. She has cross-asset reporter up, Bloomberg News. All right, Kriegup, get off with you. It's a rally. It's a rally. It's a broad rally, which is always a good sign. When you have tech and financials both rallying on the same day, that is a good sign. I say it's not just in the stock market, it's in the bond market too, and that's pretty significant. And I also, a little concerning because you don't want it to be, that doesn't usually happen. It doesn't usually happen. I think what you want is sustainable gains. And when you have a 3% rally on the S&B 500 or almost 3%, almost 4% on the NASDAQ, I might add. It speaks to this idea that perhaps this is really just a technical bounce. And that's where a lot of people are both kind of, it's like, who's got it right? The equity market or the bond market? Right. Right now, neither, because they're both kind of, uh, pairing back some of the moves from last week. What I will say though, is that the dollar weakness story is really playing a crucial part here. So you do have a little bit of a relief rally that I think came from Europe. And a lot of this has to do with what you saw in the UK market. Jeremy Hunt, who's considered kind of a more stable voice in UK politics. Uh, the fact that he's kind of doing a massive U-turn on trust dynamics, that's helping the UK market. How long has it been? She's only been six weeks and we're already calling it trust dynamics. There is a live feed unrelated of Liz Trust versus a lettuce to see which one is going to last longer. How horrible. But that's the kind of chaos. UK tabloids are so rough. Like we think the New York Post, we think this year. It's work at a time. Yeah, I know. I'm going there. I'm going there to the point that kind of relief rally. You're seeing this in cable. You're seeing this in the guilt market. You're certainly seeing this in equities. And with that stronger pound, you're seeing a weaker dollar. So the double. There is a fundamental boost here in that there is a relief rally that the chaos in the UK may not kind of the contagion effect is more limited. Plus the weaker dollar always helps. Ken Liz Trust, outlast on lettuce. It's a thing. It's a thing. Oh my god. Emily Grafayle, come on in here. We're not going to ask you about Liz Trust, but you are a cross asset reporter for Bloomberg News. What do you make of what Crete is saying in terms of like is this an actual bounce? Is this a technical bounce? Is this a bear market rally? Echo, Crete on the technicals because a lot of strategists are pointing out to me that last week we closed below the 200 week moving average for the S&P 500. And so stocks tend to rally off of that. And we're seeing a lot of Wall Street strategists, even the most bearish ones, Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson saying that this is a technical rally. And he actually thinks it can continue. Yeah, he said it could get up to what? 16% right? 16% right? 61.50 would be the level. This is like absent of an earnings recession and a US recession. So it's interesting because I've been reading his notes for a while and he's been talking a lot about how earnings are going to be the final. Is he usually right? Shoot to drop. He's been right this year. Yeah. This year he's been almost the most right out of a lot of the notes that I read. We see a lot of wrong for like four years ago. He's like he's a perma bear. Yeah, he is. He's a perma bear. So it's been a good year to be a perma bear. But yeah, he's actually get it right. Right. If you just keep saying you're a piece of... Sorry, I love you all strategists, but I'm just saying as we try to figure out what's going on. All right, so what's on both of your radars? Let me ask you for this week. Well, actually, can I just like pay you back on Wednesday? Yes, please. Emily said, because she brought up Mike Wilson. So I'll give you the perma bowl side of the equation. Because John Farrell went to town on John Stulfis this morning on the open. I thought it was a really great interview. So on that, it was, look, John Stulfis over at Oppenheimer Asset Management. He is known for kind of being this perma bowl. He's been right for about 10 years as a lot of the bowls have really betting on the tech stocks, et cetera. He's calling for 4,000 by year and we're at 3681 on the S&P 500.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3977,2022-10-17 18:09:46
15632," he's been right for about 10 years as a lot of the bulls have really been on the tech stocks, etc. He's calling for 4,000 by year and we're at 3681 on the S&P 500 but that 4,000 call is a drop from 4,800 and his argument was that yes there's this wall of worry and we are still bullish on equities but we just think that's going to take longer for the Fed to curb inflation than we previously thought. So still bullish but not as bullish as before by year end. Mark Moby is just talking what 9% that was wild to me that was wild to me but he's not also wrong. He says if you're going to tackle inflation by having rates even higher that's fair and I think there's a point to be made just long-term that if you have a lot of kind of pushes to manufacture right here in the United States that's going to cost money and that's going to stick around a lot of the fiscal policy has like a 10-year time frame so is to going back to 2% really a long-term thought this is what I think about on the weekends which is okay we all do a little bit of that mix too much. These are your dreams or the nightmares or you're just actually thinking about that? Well I took a six day on Friday and all I could like do was check Twitter and then like ask questions about that. Yeah, don't worry. You're okay. This is what happens when you do this job. What's on your radar? So I also I'll say I do have dreams in black and orange. I don't know if I'm the only one that like dreams and the Bloomberg. Because of Halloween. No, not. It's not. No, Syracuse Sports Reference though. I understand. I understand. Determinal talk. Okay. But also I mean I didn't think about this on the weekend but this morning I've been thinking about earning season. Gina Martin Adams from Bloomberg Intelligence actually had a really interesting point that she made this morning about how earnings could calm stocks in the coming week so maybe it's not only a technical bounce maybe we are going to get another beat and she pointed out that the projection for EPS growth for the S&P 500 for this third quarter this upcoming earning season. It's come down a lot. So in June analysts were forecasting a 10% EPS growth and now it's only 2%. So now the bar for earning season is so low it's likely that we'll get a beat and that could push stocks out. It's so low that that right exactly. It's so much since the summer. And thing above equity investors can be like yay. Everything is awesome. Like I said. Emily Grafetto thank you so much cross-asset reporter at Bloomberg News and I thank so always to Cretigoup to Anchor and Markets Gorsmond at Bloomberg. We're often running. We are.

15633," And a big thank you to Ann Mosque, there with World of National News. So we talked about Mark Moby-S, and we just brought it into our market conversation with Cretian Emily. This is on the Bloomberg terminal, thanks to two of our TV colleagues earlier, Guy Johnson and... Go down a higher, yeah. Yeah, but Alex still talking with Mark Moby-S earlier on television. Yeah, the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation is better in fund manager Mark Moby-S, warning that interest rates will soar to 9%. Here's what he said, quote, if inflation is 8%, the playbook says you've got to raise rates higher than inflation, which means 9%. He, of course, is the co-founder of Moby-S Capital Partners. What policymakers may not hike so aggressively should consumer prices soften. The 86-year-old investor says he doesn't see inflation receiving, quote, anytime soon. So this gets to what is it going to take to bring down inflation? And so far, think about the reads we got last week, right? Hot inflation, parents, reminding us that it's really persistent and sticky and staying, even though we are seeing some parts, you know, come down, we talked about shelter costs and other aspects of our economy, use cars, right? But you do wonder what will it take to bring it down? If we start to see inflation coming down sooner rather than later, then maybe the Fed doesn't have to be so aggressive. But this is the predicament we are in. Yeah, and look, I mean, later today, we're going to be speaking to what, David Dietz, who I know, is argues in his notes that inflation is peaking, right? Or inflation has peaked. It's a familiar refrain we've heard from many, many people over the last few months. And indeed, we have seen it come down just a teeny bit, but one tenth of one percent, that's not much to write home about. No, exactly. And this is the thing that's really tricky for investors as we try to calculate, you know, how long the Fed continues on its aggressive rate increases. We're at Bullard talking about it over the weekend, right? And I mean, their data dependent, they're going to watch. But until inflation starts to come down, you see a significant persistent trendline to the downside. You know, the Fed's going to have to be pretty aggressive. Even though they keep reminding us, it takes a while. There's a lag from Fed policy raising rates to impacting the economy. OK, well, let's end on Fed policy, because traders and Fed funds futures are pricing in that the rate will peak near 5% in March. Market-derived expectations on the one-year inflation outlook have tumbled from as high as 6% in March to 3.2%. Very different from Moease's 9%. All right, we're going to have more on that a little bit later on. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Radio.

15635," gamers beat NFTs. I'm trying to think of the short version of it. Basically gamers for about a decade and a half have had to sort of tolerate increasingly aggressive pricing models for games. So where you used to pay one price for one game and take the entire thing home, now you sort of have to buy a piecemeal, perpetually into the future in order to participate in online games, the types of which the metaverse wants to be. And because these games are perpetual and susceptible to public feedback, gamers may themselves know they immediately registered their annoyance with the idea of pushing NFTs into the space and sort of scared a lot of people off of their initial curiosity. So let's spin it forward a little bit because as we teased a little bit, the metaverse has some interesting, well interesting in and of itself, right? But what is this potentially hold for games and where the metaverse could go? I mean I think in terms of what people theorize the metaverse to be, you can look at preexisting games and sort of get an idea, Fortnite is referred to as a sort of metaverse game where winning is sort of less of an objective than just like hanging out with people and doing funny dances and stuff. Minecraft similarly. And so if you look at those as a model for like sort of prototypical metaverses that already have millions of early adopters, then trying to sort of push NFTs or crypto things or experiences that people don't necessarily want on something they're already used to is a problem that I think a lot of companies are going to experience. Well Brian, this was like the one place that the metaverse was supposed to succeed, that crypto was supposed to succeed, that NFTs were supposed to succeed, right? And many people have argued that even if they do only succeed in gaming, it's such a huge industry that that's kind of enough. What does this say about a company like Facebook that's trying to pivot into going all in on the metaverse and get us to do our meetings in the metaverse if NFTs can't take off when it comes to gaming? I mean, I think some of it has to do with messaging. I think for a long time game companies have put out pre-rendered trailers that show fantastical ideas of what they hopefully think the finished product look like and have based a lot of criticism and backlash when the finished product falls short of that. So I think some of it has to do with realizing that possible metaverse consumers are a lot more tax savvy and a lot more wary of marketing material than tech companies might think. And so it's about making sort of a clear and accurate message to them rather than just saying, well we hope it's like this one day. It's about expressing what the tangible benefit is currently or in the near future. OK, so you have this great line in here. Digital horse armor may be a waste of money, but it can at least be fun. So I mean, there could be fun, but maybe NFTs aren't exactly what people are looking for. And that gets to this idea that as you write the NFTs are sort of inherently vehicles for financial speculation. So I'm curious, how has this gone over within the game industry itself? Because they were the ones that were sort of administering the Kool-Aid in this instance.

I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flat. Alright, Charlie, thank you so much so much going on when it comes to the big banks and of course, we had some more earnings this morning. They're all on our radar again, B of A shares rallying is loan revenue top estimates also net interest income up 24% of the highest level at least a decade. You've got gold, but also higher their reporting earnings tomorrow. But we got some news that's going to combine its investment banking and trading business and then there's some stuff on credit. So he's, oh my god, I'm exhausted already. Well, fortunately, we have Shrinata Rajan here to help us out because he can report on all that and more. He's finance reporter for Bloomberg News. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio. I want to start with a gold the Goldman story Goldman shaking up its leadership ranks in yet another overhaul. What's the big headline here? What's the what's the what's the reorg who's taking who's taken over for these divisions? I thought with the last three words of that headline yet another overhaul and I feel to some extent, that's more than news than actually what they're moving around. It's not the rearranging of the deck chest to be clear without any ice burgundy. But it is not about the changes itself. But the fact that it's happening again, because David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs is four years into the top job at the Wall Street giant. And there is this is the third major restructuring he's undertaking, not just that with this move, he will be undoing a lot of the signature moves he put in place and changes he made just two years ago. That is not a good look and that gives a little bit of whiplash to invest. So let me actually step in and tell you what the changes are. You have a Goldman Sachs with four distinct divisions trading investment banking to units where their strength is it's fair to say unparalleled. Then they had this asset management business, which is the Goldman Sachs asset management business investing in public markets and behalf of other investors, as well as this much in man, which was sort of there in house private equity shop. And then the fourth pillar which was actually created in 2020 was this consumer and wealth management business because that catered to individual money, some very, very, very, very rich people and some average Joe's. But those were all people that Goldman was targeting. They wiped the slate clean, they've combined banking and trading in a way to try and show guess to the market that hey, if you see banking and trading as one combined group similar to how JP Morgan does it similar to how Morgan Stanley does it. You may be able to appreciate how well, I can't use the words of how good it is. That's one goal with C.I.B. Then what they did and we've talked about for a few months now, they've had major issues with their consumer business. They're effectively dismembering that bringing back wealth management into their asset management business, shoving a part of their direct to consumer business which operated under the Marcus brand name into that unit. And then the third is this weirdly named business called platform solutions has such a McKinsey and ring to it. But it is taking their, you know, the online loans provided that they bought last year green sky, the credit card partnerships, which is the ones that they have with Apple and General Motors and the transaction banking business bringing it under one roof, having it as a standalone business, think of it somewhat like embedded finance, which a lot of people are hot on, including McKinsey. Wow, I'm actually close on this McKinsey conspiracy theory. They might have been behind this now. To be clear, I do not know for sure. I hear some reporting a little bit later on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3984,2022-10-17 18:39:45
15639," Might have been behind this now. To be clear, I do not know for sure. I hear some reporting a little bit later on. But it is a standalone business, and it will be interesting to watch because that business will report losses for the foreseeable future for the next quarter or two or three or four or more. Not many Wall Street banks have a standalone division that where the P&L will be so visible and so painful. Goldman's got to hope that investors don't pay too much scary attention to it, are willing to cut them some slag and actually see the new new new narrative that they're trying to spread and believe in it. What prompted this shift? A number of things. First of why this shift? Just in January, you did a massive change of the asset management leadership. In 2020, we just talked about all the other changes they made. But the mumbling and grumbling outside of Goldman Sachs had been clear for the better part of the last six months. They worried about the situation in the asset management group and how the new leadership is getting along. They really worried about the consumer business, which as we've reported at mid-year, they projected would lose while more than $1.2 billion in a year. In a year when the bank's total earnings is expected to drop 40% from the success, the fabulous success they had in 2021, that was just too harsh a spotlight on that business. So it was clear something had to be done. And it's fair to say that the problems with consumer accelerated some of the discussions they had about other reoggs. If you're bringing back asset and wealth management and making this large one unit, you probably do the CIB aspect of it. The banking and trading combination is something people had been pushing for at the firm. David Solomon and his team had been reluctant about that because they were more interested in steering investor attention towards asset management and consumer. Those recurring fee businesses that they think investors will appreciate. Now that they've actually made this combined banking, global banking and markets group, perhaps it's an acknowledgement that maybe this fair to shine the spotlight on their crown jewel, and maybe it will give them a boost with investors. That we don't know yet, and that we'll see over the coming months and quarters. All right, well, an incredible story. And then ahead of, of course, Goldman has its earnings tomorrow. We're going to leave it on that note. Bloomberg News Finance reporter Shrinath Arojan in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Sheers of Goldman Sachs, by the way, they are up 2% in today's session. Another standout among the big banks, Bank of America, up more than 6% following its earnings report right now. We want to head over to our TV colleague and radio colleague David Weston, who is sitting down with Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan. Let's listen in. From Bloomberg World Headquarters in New York, welcome to our TV and radio audiences worldwide. I'm David Weston. Bank of America reported its third quarter results today. Net interesting come was the highest in at least a decade, chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan saying US consumer clients remain resilient. And Brian Moynihan himself, the chairman and CEO of Bank of America joins us now. Brian, thank you so much for being with us. You said the consumer is strong, continues to be strong. I think you said 10% up perhaps from what you saw in October. But how long can it last? Do you have some competitors saying, by the middle of the next year, they're going to have run out of those balance sheets? David, good to be with you again. So let's step back and talk about the different ways we talk about resiliency. First is are the consumer spending? Are they doing things? They've got drives, the US economy, as you well know. And so spending for the third quarter was 10% higher, it was last year's third quarter. The spending for the first couple of weeks in October is 10% higher, it was last October for the first two weeks. Now what we told people is you're seeing it slow just a hair. So it was maybe 14%, 15% early in the year, 12% and now 10. Which is frankly, what people are trying to do is get the spending down a little bit, get the inflationary pressures down and the drag and the interest rates, but it's still strong. And then that's one way to think about it. The other way to think about the consumers did that money in their accounts to spend. And in a month of September, their account balances were flat or slightly over where they were in August. And that is multiples of where they were pre-pandemic and they continue to hold their own. And you can see inside the cash flow customers, not making any reflection on this is tough on certain customers others, but even the customers have lower income levels, we can send cash flowing positive still. Ren increases, can slow that down, other things can happen. The core thing is, as of the third quarter, they continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3985,2022-10-17 18:44:14
15640," There's others, but even the customers have lower income levels. We can send cash flowing positive still. Rent increases, can slow that down, other things can happen. But the core thing is as of the third quarter, they continue to cash flow, and it can have more money in their counts than they did before the pandemic by multiples. And then you go to their credit quality, and a credit quality of Bank of America, and our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment, the linkancies are much lower, and they were a pay pandemic, much lower, and they were in any average, five best year type period. And just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much lower in a bend. So consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed, you can see the unemployment numbers, and they have good credit. And that's good news for America, but it also makes a FESD job. So Africans are trying to slow down this American consumer, which is a very resilient thing. But just to make sure I understand it, and obviously you can't promise what's going to happen next year. I'm not asking you to do that. But a lot of economists are saying the reason consumer is so strong right now is because the balance sheet was so strong coming out of the pandemic. At this point, you don't see those balance sheets really turning down as we get into next year. We don't see it yet. And so if you look back two quarters ago, when we did the earnings, called people are like, oh, the consumers get knocked out of the game, they're spending their counts six months later, the money's still there. So I think people are over-anticipated future. We as our projections, the Canada and the Dallas-Piet and the team in our research group which is one of the best in the world has the third quarter positive, the fourth quarter negative, the first quarter negative, the second quarter of 23 negative, the third quarter of 23 negative, albeit at like a one to one and a half percent GDP analyzed growth rate, negative growth rate. So we are predicting a shallow economy. That's our core assumptions. It's an embedded in that. If you look at how we set our reserves, we have the assumption that we're gonna have five and a half percent unemployment. I'm not sure it's gonna happen, especially this quarter, we have it at five percent, but that's the conservators we build our balance sheet from an operating basis. But if you look at the consumers, there's not the signs that we see in our numbers or other people's numbers, quite frankly, it says they're slowing down yet or they're in stress yet. And that will have to be part of what happens in order for there to be a deep recession because if the consumers have money and this big consumer driven economy, that's what keeps America strong. Brian, you've always taken great pride in the Bank of America research unit and how good they are. Let's assume their numbers are exactly right. It could be better, it could be worse, exactly right. Three down quarters, five, five and a half percent unemployment. What does that do for your loan loss provisions? What kind of provisions do you have to make for that? Well, inherently, we're always discounting the future because the way the Cecil rules work, so-called you look out for the life of loans. So you build reserves and we built 400 million or so this quarter, which is building that scenario, which is 60% of the base case, which is the average of blue chip economist and 40% in adverse case. And when you blend that together, it implies those advocates have high inflation and have high unemployment in them. And you blend it together. The core, what we did at the end of the third quarter, has 5% unemployment for the fourth quarter of 22, and more than like five and a half for next year, so it's very conservatively built. So your provisions will go up against that backdrop. At one point, you'll start to see the other side of it emerge and that's what happened back in the family. We put up a lot of reserves and we took them back in once you saw that the impact of, because what the administration did and what Congress did and what the central banks did around the world, you actually mitigate the effects of the unemployment numbers. That one happened in a standard recession, I would expect, but on the other hand, the consumers are going in much stronger shape than they did even in 2006, 2007 leading into the great financial crisis. Brian, throughout your tenure, as far as I can tell, you've really embraced what you call responsible growth. We know what it's looked like in the last few years. What does responsible growth look like for Bank of America and the next four quarters? Just take four quarters. Well, we continue to look for deposits to basically outgrow the industry and the industry's predicted to go down to flat. We will be in that range, because frankly, the monetary accommodation we draw, we look at loans to grow in the mid-single digits. They grew a little faster every year, then we slow down a little bit, because some of the capital changes that occurred in the third quarter, which we've taken care of and put in a rear-view mirror. So we sort of look at that. But the key about responsible growth is people forget, it's not only the growth, it's also how we get there with our operational excellence platform, which allows us to drive expenses. The work we do in our op-X continues to fructify and to further and further gains for us. So we had three quarters in a row of flat expenses while the revenue kicked up, and that's where you see the margins kick in, and our efficiency ratios down on low 60s and moving south from there. Those are good things, but that comes from hard work beyond just, can we get growth? Beyond, it's how we run this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3986,2022-10-17 18:48:52
15641," Okay, and our efficiency ratio is down on low 60s and moving south from there. Those are good things, but that comes from hard work beyond just, can we get growth? It's beyond, it's how we run this company and the team's done a great job doing that. So Brian, again, you've prided yourself in really carefully blocking and tackling on the expense front, and you've gotten a lot of credit for that. What does that say about employment in the scenario that you're laying out? You can have cuts, but even apart from cuts, maybe through attrition, do you expect your payroll to diminish? We don't expect the payroll to diminish, and we don't expect the heck to count and move much. We're running a company today in 2022 at the same number of employees who ran the company in 2015 round numbers. What those employees do is change dramatically across this seven years, David, so it's not a short time. And so we've redeployed those employees more towards generating good work for our customers and our clients and better experience for them, and taking them out of work that we engineer how the system through the digitization of work we do by our customers and by ourselves. And we'd expect that to continue sort of relatively flat head count, but there's a massive change that goes on underneath that. So we added 1,000 people in our investment banking team over the last 12, 18 months, and we're not gonna, we're gonna keep those teammates and keep driving because we're number three market share, and we think we can get more if we keep deploying people out to go see those great clients we have. So we don't need to drop expense, and we're running basically at a level that people that our company feels strong at and good profit margins, and you have natural adjustments to go on when markets go up and down based on bonuses stuff, but that's not the core case. The 213,000, so teammates we have here, you are doing a great job, and our job is to keep them fully. Can we manage the head count up or down? Sure, head count, you have biotrition that goes on, you can always manage it down, but right now we're kind of flat, we expected maintain flat. Now remember, we had to hire like 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people, this past quarter, third quarter, 22, to keep that head count basically up a little bit. So our teammates who leave us go to great jobs are in other places, we've trained them well, we'd rather for them to stay, and our traditions coming down, but when they don't, that doesn't mean they're going to sit on the bench, they're actually going out there to work for someone else, and we bring more teammates in and do a great job with them. Right, I know one of the things you've paid a lot of attention to, you and your team, I should say, is value at risk. Tell us about trading value at risk. How are you going to be managing that through, even under your projections of a shallow recession, it's still going to be a bumpy ride. Well, let's just start with the backdrop. Jimmy Demar and the team did a great job this quarter, and had the strongest third quarter in 2022 they've had since 2010 in trading, and so fixed income rose, the investments we made in a balance sheet, and a talent in that business over the last three or four years, Barrett Fruit, starting under Tom Montaggan, now under Jimmy. The second thing is, the way they manage risk, they didn't have a trading loss day, the whole quarter, and a very volatile quarter, and that's how they manage risk. Our job is to move the risk from the market to the client, back to the market, and we're in a moving game, not the storage game, and value at risk has gone up, because of volatility and the calculations, but it's still way below, probably 25% of where it was at the volatile times back coming out of the financial crisis, and the balance sheet strong and Jimmy team has done a good job. We'll continue to manage that. We continue to watch how much risk they put on. They make judgments every day, but they have risk-weighted assets and var limits and the var limits by desk, and they manage all that for us, but it doesn't constrain their ability to do good business, but you've got to start from the basic principle. We're not in this business to pull a lot of that risk in the market's business on a balance sheet. Our job is to move it through the system. Talk about a couple specific areas. One of the leverage loans. There seems to be some stress in the leverage loan area right now. How do you assess the risk in that business? Are you going to be retrenching? Well, there's a natural retrenching that went on because the market stopped. When the spreads went out and the cost of debt became so expensive, that deals harder to get done. So that's what happened. So that stopped, I don't know, three, six months, three or four months ago, probably maybe even six. And so what's happened now is we're working through the pipeline existed. Then those marks went through the P&L. We market every week based on the analytics going through every deal. It was less this quarter than the quarter before, and it's through the system. To restart that market, you've got to get the stability, and you've got to get the pricing stability, and you've got to get the lending capacity, stability, how many debt turns you can do, and things like that. And then that market can restart. And it's still bouncing around too much for that. We've got to let that play through. But in the end of the day, we look at those credits and make sure we understand the credit risk. And what's happening now is the price is blowing out. Therefore, there's more, more than there is an underlying credit. Some of the deals are structured very well, and that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3987,2022-10-17 18:53:08
15642," Look at those credits and make sure we understand the credit risk and what's happening now is a price is blowing out. Therefore, there's more, there's more than there is an underlying credit. Some of those deals are structured very well and that's how we drive responsible growth. But on the other hand, the restart of that market is going to take a little bit to the stumps, the ability and the spreads and pricing and the economy and the risk around the economy because that market really is driven by people's perceptions in your term risk. Brian, as you know, well, there's a lot of concern given the stress domestically and particularly internationally on whether there could be market disruptions. In fact, one of the things that I've read a lot about is a real reduction in the liquidity in the US Treasury market. Are you seeing that and what are the risks that poses? We assume market disruption. So what happened in the UK a week or so ago, we just assume that's going to happen and it challenges to be balanced and have your risk managed well and have your risk kept and not lean the company and lean the book too far either way because then you get caught. And so we expect those market disruptions. There are issues because of the rules that were put upon our peer institutions and our institution that have constrained liquidity and they look at those rules and they've waved those rules and times of stress. I think they need to look more carefully at them. They know that to make sure that things like treasuries have no risk and just that market can stay open and wide and deep every day. And it bumps around every once in a while because of people's views of really spreads and rates. It has nothing to do with the credit risk. And I think we believe that some of that stuff should be counted the way it is so we can be more active in the intermediaries markets. But if these are the rules we've got to play by. Well, that's exactly what I want to ask about. Are there some regulatory things that we can do that could alleviate that? There's the Basel III, as I understand is coming out. There may be increases reserves there. On the other hand, there's also the supplemental leverage ratio that was suspended for the pandemic then brought back in. Should they be considering doing something to sort of increase the liquidity in treasuries? I think the SLR relief at a time of stress when they need the banks to be strong sort of proves the point is that they may not have it calibrated. But they're looking at all that. In the end of the day, our supplementary leverage ratio for our company is very strong, very far over the minimum. And it's tens of billions of dollars a capital and excess of what's required. So we're there to do it. It's just that you want that market, that is the market, the world bench marks off. We've got to keep it open and deep and trading and liquid because that is the market where everything else plays off. When there's disruptions in that market, it reverberates throughout the world and that's what we don't need to do. So we raise rates for causing reverberations of the world. We don't need a liquidity reverberation on top of that. So we advocate as an industry a lot that they ought to look at that and think about whether there's any real risk there and let us intermediate a little more fully. So you're trying to refer to what happened with the Bank of England and the British government for that matter involving those pension plans and long-term guilds as I understand it. And you said we have to expect something like that could happen. My understanding is often it happens in the dark corners that we don't know as much about and often it's a matter of leverage. Where do we have the most leverage in the system right now and particularly in darker places? Well, as we've made clear over the last several years, the banking industry continues to be well managed by the management of the company and the teammates that work for these companies. Well regulated, capital levels up, liquidity and all these different rules managed and all the different ways looked at active, active, forceful stress testing done once a year by the Federal Reserve and multiple times during the year by the companies. And so you put all that together. It's a pretty strong framework. The problem is what's outside the system. And so if you look at some of the advocacy that we make as a group of banks is half of every lending asset class is now outside the system. So the amount of leverage can go on in the unregulated industries may or may not be consistent. Now the good news is most of that's what they call net asset value. In other words, if the asset goes down, the amount the O, the investor goes down, so it kind of takes care of itself. It's not a deposit which is fixed in the dollar on the other side. But it's not always true and some of that leverage can hurt. So I think if you look at banking systems where it's leverage credit for years, we've kept a lot of limitations on how much leverage and debt turns, the SNCC process, the shared national credit process, the examinations by the regulators, kind of keeps the banking system aligned outside as the worries. And you saw the FSOC and others kind of think about that. And we advocate that we need that because in the other day, it affects our system even if it's done outside it. For our Bloomberg television radio audience is worldwide. We're talking with the Bank of America chair and CEO Brian Moynihan. And we're doing it all yellow in Presidential ex-investment and we're discussing that Sticker Devices are pretty good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3988,2022-10-17 18:58:08
15643, because in the day it affects our system even if it's done outside uh... for our bloomberg television radio audiences worldwide we're talking with the bank of america chair and see you brine moan and uh... brine tell me about your customers and how badly they're suffering from inflation as you talk to them because you talk to a lot of not just the big guys but the medium and smaller guys how badly are they hurting because of inflation well the it's the inflations one thing but also the rate structure that was moved you know countervailed the inflation so it doesn't take a person to case analyst to realize that we raise rates people gonna have a hard time uh... borrowing things so if you look at the mortgage market for example the increase in mortgages has lowered in number mortgages are getting done our production equals eight billion as quarter versus twenty-odd billion last year this time so you start to see that impact of what that really reflects is refinancing on one side but also home purchases and the ability to qualify so you're seeing that you're seeing the impact start to come through the rental market to match the increases that landlords will feel in the debt financing to do the refinance their buildings and do their bills although they'll lock in and in people have to remember the lot of this debt is now locked in for long periods of time under prior rate structures both at the consumer level half our mortgage under three and eighty percent or under under four or something like that so that's locked in very strongly but on the other hand those right rates had that impact in the stress occurs and building qualified for mortgage credit and auto credit those are the sort of fastest moving changes and then move the cards move a little bit not that much frankly in the grain screen of things but you see it sort of moves those areas and on the business side as you know the base rates move up so for a lot of or et cetera and uh... bisbee and things like that you see the spread but on top of that that'll slow down activity because it cost a debt just becomes higher that's how you slow down economy that is expected outcome that is what the feds trying to use it bringing down economy the questions can it be landed right but on the other hand you're seeing exactly expect which is the conservators and build-in terms of inventory cost you more to carry in terms of you know buying a building will cost you more to finance you know on the business side you're seeing that and you're seeing line usage come down a little bit because people are using the cash a little more aggressively because if they can avoid borrowing and saves you know at this point you have a couple of basis points over these spreads is a fairly size number right one last one is come back to the consumer where we started you said that you're anticipation for back america is to grow deposits at better than the market does that say anything about savings rates for our households across the country expect those to remain salary pick up well you know as we look you we you know we uh... which the record number of uh... investors are mail edge platform are sort of you have general platform not marl and a private bank which in the wealth management business the three point four million we had a i think a hundred thousand new accounts open this year something like that and that new accounts this quarter this year you know you're seeing people continue to invest because people should be investing for the future i just worked with we have our employees in a half fifty-year milestones fifty five sixty and one seventy five years work of the company data sell break them and i was looking at the right up of one of the teammates in he started a business that i was at five hundred so the ideas for people to be invested in and invest over time in it will be ups and downs but if you stay you'll with us great american economy is great american companies you'll be fine so our job is to help people invest in the future the savings rate how people spend you'd expect spending the slow down a little bit you saw that a little bit uh... because people are gonna be more conservative the inflation makes the dollar they spend not go as far those are real issues but that's the intended outcome of trying to slow down the economy higher rates and deal with inflation to bring it back under control so real-wage growth starts to happen those are things that feds doing but if you really think about it our vice-star customers is you know stay invested the right way look for quality uh... companies in indian and katey and the precise in the world and and but don't be afraid of any environment and yet you might be more opportunities and treasuries now than it was a year ago but that's that's life and that happens in flows but you gotta keep saving your money invest for your future there's the advice we're looking for thank you so much brine really appreciate your time that's back of a chair and cio brine one and and now back to you what a great interview david weston we thank you and of course this is count down to the close

15644," Han, or is it just everything as it seems to be on the day, how it does seem so broad based and we're certainly seeing, um, as you said, investors finding lots of opportunities throughout the financial markets today. One thing that I've also been thinking about about everything we got out of China this past weekend and we're seeing investors buy up some of those Chinese names and as I called and dragon up about three and a half percent here. So we're seeing some market out performance and it's interesting because we did get from President Xi, you know, concerns about COVID still and concerns about geopolitical tensions, but nonetheless, we did also have Chinese regulators talk about wrapping up efforts to support the stock market. And so we have seen investors certainly here in the US come into that in a big way. Yeah, I was mostly interested just now to hear what Brian Moynihan of Bank of America had to say about the American consumer, a lot of strong signals essentially not seeing spending come down to the extent that many would have thought given high prices and the fact that many have argued over the last few months, we're heading into a recession. But I mean, those comments not hurting the rally that we're seeing today. I mean, rally that Bank of America is large part benefiting from on the day, we're seeing of course some of the banks doing particularly well. Let's look at the majors overall because S&P 500 is on the higher side overall up by 2.65%. We're up 3.4% on the NASDAQ. Actually, volumes are a little bit more muted than we're used to, but we're up more than 1.8% on the Dow. And look at that, Russell 2000. Even the small cap's getting a bit tell us something you were keeping an eye on. Yeah, we've heard a lot about their small cap rebound that is leading the way. We'll get into that in a little bit more. Remain at least for now on the large cap's in S&P 500. Some huge breath, if I will. Every sector in the green discretionary bigout performer real estate actually catches the bid given bond yields are falling down at the bottom. Energy, which you typically don't see, but it is still up about 1.5%. Yeah, you talk about some of the big cap tech names that help in and lift the stock, lift the market higher here on the day, apple up about 3% Nvidia, up almost 6% here on the day. Most of the tech stocks, in fact, are really getting in on the action. Semiconductor stocks, I should say. Meanwhile, you only got about 20 stocks in the S&P 500 that are lower. One of those is Charles Schwab. Interesting earnings reports. Some of the top line numbers actually met or exceeded expectations, but some concern here about cash and the balance sheet and more importantly, sort of how that's all being sorted out on that balance sheet. Those shares down about 2% on the day. But probably one of the biggest losers, at least on a percentage basis, that belongs to Canto Health down about 39% right now. There was a lot of M&A speculation around this stock over the past couple of weeks. CVS, there was a report out earlier today from people familiar with the matter saying that CVS was not going to pursue an M&A deal with Canto Health and then CVS did come out with a statement saying that they're not willing to comment on that. Nevertheless, investors taking that as a sign that maybe a deal isn't quite in the works. And despite the best efforts of Canto Health to go lower, we are still seeing the markets go higher. But maybe we're starting to see that by the dip mentality, the Morgan Stanis of this world, the Mike Wilson saying, that maybe we could have a bear market rally. As we have seen people getting more and more pessimistic, the strategists in general have been lowering their expectation of where the S&P is going to end the year. We're down nearly 7% in the last month in terms of the outlook from strategists, largest drop, and at least seven months, shout out to Pete Deeteros for this one. Love that chart, that pessimism. Maybe that's going to make sense with this next individual. He's been a long time market watcher. We're talking about Mark Mobius, invests around the globe, founding partner of his own for Mobius Capital. But he talked about basically how extreme it could get when it comes to interest rates. Here's what he had to say. Anybody sitting on debts, high debts are going to be in trouble because of the higher interest rates. I see interest rates in America going to 9% because the Fed is going to have to be going to raise 9. Simply because if inflation is 8%, the playbook says you've got to raise rates higher than inflation, which means 9%. Of course, that theory will go out the window if CPI goes down, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. And of course, that's Mark Mobius of Mobius Capital Partners. And you do think about how persistent we got that in the US readings remain last week in terms of inflation. So how persistent it is, it's not coming down and you do wonder how far the Fed is going to have to do to start turning the corner when it comes to inflation. Yeah, and that gets us back to the whole debate about that terminal rate. And I mean, in fairness to that comment there, I mean, you have actually seen some softening in certain areas that the Fed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3990,2022-10-17 19:06:06
15645," Yeah, and that gets us back to the whole debate about that terminal rate. And I mean, in fairness to that comment there, I mean, you know, you have actually seen some softening in certain areas that the Fed pays attention to. And of course, it's not just the differential between that deadline, 8% number, probably better is to go off the base of that PCE number, but still his point is taken. You have to get the terminal rate in theory above where inflation is, or at least somewhere to match it, sort of the two ships passing in the night. And we're definitely not there, probably a long way away from being there. And then what does that mean for discounting of what your value of equity is? What does that mean for growth stocks? The fact that we've got so many of these earnings coming from a number of the growth stocks. Netflix has been on a terrible rate. We've got Netflix later in the week. We've got Tesla. What is the underlying performance in these companies? Weathering inflation within their own companies and being able to pass it on? The NIs of our web version, this is going to be the crucial season, Tim, when you think about those companies, at least within Big Tech, that Caroline was just talking about, who really can manage those cash flows and do well. And again, those who are really maybe sort of more tied to the macroeconomic slowdown and the impact that that has on them. Overall, though, too, there's been a big focus on some of the small caps. And remain there is a really interesting note, about how small caps are some of the biggest discounts they've had to the S&P 500, the small cap 600 index, at least by one measure. Right. The bottom 5th percentile, I think it was. So at least some measures are pockets that look attractive. I saw that same note. And of course, historically, we know there's something Taylor, we call the value trap. And the question is, if you sort of pile back into some of those cyclical names, based solely on valuation, then are you setting yourself up for that? Now, if you genuinely believe that the cycle is turning here and that we are sort of past the worst case scenarios with regards to recession and economic downturn, then yeah, it makes sense. Well, Goldman Sachs out with a note also that says there are some value plays to be found in some of the tech growth stocks that have gotten beat up this year, including companies like Meta platforms at the same time, even though the S&P 500 down is down what, roughly a quarter so far this year, they're still saying the index on a level is still too expensive to buy. Gotta say, think about it, Gina Martin Adams has laid out for all of us. Third quarter earnings expectations have come down way down from what we saw over the summer. I think we're looking for about 10% growth on the third quarter. It's now down to 2%. So, you know, the thinking is the bar is so low when it comes to earnings so that any beat, how will investors read it? Will they see that as optimism will they understand kind of the economic outlook? You know, gotta kind of think about that as we pursue the numbers. 19 straight weeks now of revision, the city index of revisions going more downgrades than upgrades, what's already being priced in? But many like Mark Hayford over at UBS was saying it's not yet priced in if you're looking at value. Well, that's what I'm curious. I mean, is the bar really that low? I mean, I think for certain companies, you can definitely make that case before the so the market is a whole, I think some would argue that maybe the bar hasn't come down enough. And to your point, too, Taylor, what you were just talking about, I mean, just because something cheap doesn't mean it, there's value. Some people say there's a reason. There's a reason. Yeah, there's a reason why. There's a small cap because it never is the ability to grow and to be big. So, we hear you loud and clear, but I'll keep pushing for the small caps, at least through the notes I've read of our push and forum. I want to go back to something that Brian Moynihan said during that interview that he just did with David Weston. This was shocking to me. Half of mortgage rates that they have are under 3%, 80% of them are under 4%. What does that mean for the housing market? People are not going to get up and move because then they're going to give up that incredibly low mortgage rate that perhaps they're not going to see for years. What does that do to the housing market? Well, what's interesting is it just shows that some of the Fed policy already, obviously having an impact and we're seeing that play out, but you do wonder about, right? If you're not moving around, you're not buying new stuff for new homes. It certainly brings down economic momentum. How did we not mention BTS guys? I'm just asking. Wait, they're all going to the Army or something, right? I know. That's good. I mean, for the Army or anything. Yeah, anyway. Anyway, they're popular, right? I heard some levity. They're too pretty to go to the store. They're going. They're going remain. You think they would get an exemption? I know, apparently. I mean, for all the joy that they brought us over the years. I know. They're fun. Maybe that's time for a new recruits to come. BTS. They can start to. What about black pink? Do they have to go to? We're going to get yelled at. We got to go.

This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes, Tim Stenevich, on Bloomberg Radio. So lots really think about interesting interview from Brian Moynihan by our David Weston, of course, the CEO of Bank of America, out with earnings, very upbeat in terms of consumers. So it's interesting to hear what the big banks have to say. I do also wonder when we hear from the big banks, important and understanding financial markets and how things are going, how indicative though is it of the broader economy? Here's some quotes from that. The consumer is strong, there aren't the signs in our numbers or anyone else's numbers that they, the consumers are slowing down or that they're stressed. Brian Moynihan saying that he doesn't see balance sheet turning down, quote, yet at this point. Yeah, so, but that's good, right? It's really good. When we think about financial market structures and credit stress and so on and so forth. So I do think that is certainly significant. What did he say? Credit quality is strong while the linkancies are low, shallow economy. Those signs don't show stress. So these are important indicators. And as we continue to watch it, we're just getting going when it comes to earning. And so we've got a lot of work to do. We got to hear from Apple, we got to hear from Tesla. We're just getting started. I think only 60 companies in the S&P report this week. I want to hear from those companies in the consumer space. What are we seeing when it comes to consumer spending? So lots more with that. All right, let's get a check on world of national news for that. It's over to Anne Moss, too, in our Bloomberg newsroom. Thanks, Carol. We're lying on Iranian arms. Russia has attacked Kiev with drones. The strikes highlight Russia's growing use of Iranian made drones. As Western analysts say, Moscow's stocks of precision missiles are running low. Federal prosecutors in the U.S. are recommending six months of jail time for former Trump advisor Steve Bannon. This comes after he was convicted of contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with the subpoena from the committee investigating last year's capital attack. Bannon would not testify or turn over documents to the panel. UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ripped up almost all of what was left of Prime Minister Liz Truss's economic program. He's absolutely new to trust dynamics. He's reversed most of Truss's tax cuts. He's limited the energy bailout that she was always taunting the opposition-labored a carestarma with that her package was bigger than his. Now it's going to be reviewed in April to try and save the government some money, a huge humiliation for Truss. That's Bloomberg's Lizzy burden.

And thank you so much. Ann Mosque, there with our World of National News update. So we're going to dig into what was safe to say one of the big stories to certainly overnight over the weekend, a lot of news coming out of China President Xi making some comments. So where do you want to begin? I want to start with the COVID-0 policy and the fact that it's still leading to lockdowns. And we're not just talking lockdowns of small areas. I mean, maybe small relative to China's huge cities. But there's now an area being locked down in China, almost one million people near the iPhone and near an iPhone factory. It's the iPhone manufacturing hub of Zhengzhou. It's locking down one of its most populated districts to tame a virus flare up with creeping restrictions throughout China, underscoring the constant threat of disruption that companies face while the country sticks to COVID-0. I mean, this is the sticky part of China in terms of trying to figure out what happens. I mean, their economy is looking at, you know, the slowest growth in a long time. And we're going to talk about that with our Eric Schatzger in just a moment of Bloomberg New Economy. Think we, we have, we're going to talk about theату in August fik to start that month or Friday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3992,2022-10-17 19:14:39
15647," of trying to figure out what happens. I mean, their economy is looking at, you know, the slowest growth in a long time. And we're going to talk about that with our Eric Schatzger in just a moment of Bloomberg New Economy. But a big reason why is these constant and chronic COVID lockdowns? Well, here's what led to it, Carol. Six new local cases for Sunday in the city down from a recent peak of 40 on October 9th. Nationwide cases to climb to 697, the lowest in two weeks as outbreaks in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang came under control, Beijing posted 13 new cases in Shanghai had 32. I don't know how this ends in terms of COVID-0 because I think what we've learned over the last two years is, is it possible? Yeah, I don't know. I think at one point we lauded it, like this whole idea of saying you got to have no cases. And as we have vaccines and boosters, you need to, I don't know, I guess I think the thinking is certainly within our country. It's a different thought process. Well, look what it does to economic activity. Look what it does to companies saying we want to get out of there because we need to be somewhere that isn't disrupted by this. We're going to go produce, you know, X, Y, or Z in another country. Yeah. And I mean, the policy that you're seeing in China has definitely impacted their growth going forward. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about bands on US talent at China chip firms. We're talking about geopolitical tensions. We're going to get into what you need to know about China.

Carol master Tim Stenevich live here in our interactive broker studio streaming on YouTube. And we want to talk about what we've been talking about the Chinese markets. We see Chinese ADRs trading up this on news that Chinese regulators are ramping up efforts to support the stock market. You've got a lot going on. A lot of news flow out of China generally. And what is one of the key economies of our time. Yeah, very busy weekend as president Xi reaffirmed policies at the center of frictions with the US. He spent two hours hitting back and it was opened in this crucial party gathering. We got Eric Schatzger with his editorial director for Bloomberg New Economy. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio. So Eric, before we went to you, we talked a little bit about what happened over the weekend in China. We also talked a little bit about another lockdown of more than a million people in China. And I'm thinking to myself in a country the size of China that has a policy for COVID zero that we already know has affected the country's economy so much. How does something like this actually end? I mean, how do we go back to a China that isn't increasingly isolating itself from the rest of the world? It's an excellent question. As far as COVID goes and you'll hear me say this word again and again and again, it's all about control, right? Demonstrating that the Chinese political model is superior to the model that we practice here in the West where we had COVID restrictions initially, but eventually recognized that the economy had to reopen because we operate a democratic society where people's free will count for something. It's consistent with what we heard from President Xi over the weekend. What he talked about, or let me say this, his commentary pointed to it, China, that on the one hand is more geopolitically assertive, but on the other hand is more economically isolated and less of a trading partner to the rest of the world. Again, because of control.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3994,2022-10-17 19:23:18
15649," hand is more economically isolated and less of a trading partner to the rest of the world. Again, because of control, he, and I'm sure you've been talking about the response in his speech to the US ban on exports of advanced semiconductors and related equipment, he talked about winning the battle in key core technologies and moving faster and achieving technology self-reliance. But the challenge for President Xi and for China is that he envisions this being done within a political framework that prioritizes above all ideological rectitude, national security and party control. There's that control world again. This is not the China that evolved into something resembling capitalism, right? In the years, in the three decades, really, then plus that followed, you know, Deng Xiaoping's reforms back in 1978. For the past, at least five years, if not more, President Xi has been growing suspicious of market forces and the threats that they present to political stability and the perceived threat that he feels or felt anyway in me, in a longer field because he's put them in a box from tycoons like Jack Maon, Ponimah. So how do we need to think, I think, about our audience, the investing audience? How do we need to think about China going forward for so many years, right? For so long, it was all about global multinationals looking to get into China, have access to that market. So what is it going forward? Well, China will be more inwardly focused and those who were counting on sheet of reverse course and increase access may find themselves disappointed. I will emphasize that it is awfully hard to make anything that sounds like a prediction. First of all, you know, he hasn't yet secured his third term as president. The Communist Party Congress doesn't end until the 22nd of this month. It still has a few days to run. What's expected? Yes, yes, yes. It's widely baked into the cake. But if he insists that Chinese scientific advances and innovation need to fall under the umbrella of state control, which is to say largely done by or directed by state-owned enterprises, it will look very different from what we know in the West and what it China was increasingly looking like, which was a somewhat centrally planned but nevertheless still capitalist economy. And if you take that to its logical conclusion, to me anyway, it begins to sound a lot like the Soviet Union. And it's not to say that the Soviet Union didn't have brilliant scientists and didn't achieve great things technologically. It did, if you think about the things that the Soviets did with their space program, if you think about the things that the Soviets did militarily, like develop fighters, like the Big 25 and the Big 29 that were every bit as competitive with what the United States and Europe could produce. And in many cases, better, but ultimately not sustainable, not sustainable technologically and not sustainable politically. And I don't need to remind everybody what happened in 1989. But Eric, in the last 30 seconds that we have with you, with given that pretty much every single American company wants access to China, does that still? Still, still, does that portend potentially a different ending? It does. What they see there is 1.4 billion people to whom they want to sell things. That's a very naked commercial instinct. But if you're a shareholder of a company that's looking to grow revenue and grow earnings, it's logical. But by bit, by bit, you have to ask yourself, if you're the CEO or the board of that company, is this viable over the long run, given what we keep hearing at a President's sheet? Because it does seem like the risks continue to increase.

I'm just saying it. That's not a good sign, Carol. It's not a good sign. Well, coming up we're going to get into a most red on the Bloomberg. It's really fascinating about the one market that dipires are wadering on in terms of leading us out of this market turmoil. We'll be joined by senior markets that are at Harrison and at Justa Minute. First up, they're Charlie Pellett. We got less than a half hour to go. The 20 minutes to be precise, Tim, the Dow, the S&P, Nesdeck, they're all pushing higher. Stocks climbing after the S&P 500 breached a technical level that has triggered gains in the past. Risk appetite, him proving is more of UK Prime Minister Liz Trusses unfunded tax cuts were reversed. Now, the breadth of this rally is so strong that at one point we had 95, actually 99% of companies in the S&P pushing higher. So here's what we stand. We're going to get the S&P up 97 close to session highs right now. That is a gain of 2.7% the Dow of 585 up by 2% Nesdeck up 355. That is a gain right now of about 3.5%.

That's the good news the consumer is healthy and so now that we have sort of the four biggest diversified banks coming in, you know, charge offs came in better than expected that's current credit trends to the banks did set aside some money for the future but I would say generally modest compared to some concern.

Very close to the day's best levels. I'm Charlie Palette. That is a Bloomberg business flat. Alright, Charlie. Thank you so much. So as we mentioned, the next thing we want to get into, it's the most right on the Bloomberg terminal today. It's about how investors are looking beyond a looming global recession and they see one country and its financial markets emerging strongest on the other side. We're talking about US stocks and bonds leading the way out of the current wave of market turmoil. This, according to respondents in the latest, M-Live Pulse Survey. We've got Ed Harrison now, senior markets editor at Bloomberg News joining us on the phone from Washington, DC. Ed, good to have you with us this afternoon. What else did we learn from the M-Live Pulse Survey? Yeah, Tim, it was very interesting. I think what we learned was not only do investors think that US stocks and bonds will do better on the backside of global turmoil recession, but that the US will emerge first from that recession, which is largely, I would imagine, one of the reasons that those shares will do the best. Well, take a little bit into, first of all, for folks who aren't familiar, we always are checking out your Pulse surveys that you guys do. Tell us about, give us a little bit of background about what they are, who you talk to. Yeah, so we talked to a mix of institutional and retail investors, and we asked them a series of questions on one topic at a specific time per week. In this week, we were looking at asset markets and recession, and we wanted to determine how are the markets doing, which countries are going to go into recession first between the US, the UK, and the EU, who's going to emerge first? What's the central bank response in all of this, and then how do the asset classes do both stops and bonds in those various countries? And in this particular survey, we got 452 respondents, and 47% of those respondents expect the UK to win the unwelcome prize of going into recession first. An equal number, almost the exact same amount, 45% said that Europe would go into recession first, and only 7% of the respondents said that they thought the US was going to enter a recession first. And likely meaning that the US is not in a recession right now. I'm wondering, Edord, what you can tell us about positioning as a result of this survey, because if this survey reflects positioning that institutional investors are doing, does it become some sort of self-fulfilling prophecy here, because they're essentially voting their book, right? Right. Yeah, I think that we have to look at earnings and stocks, and then also look at rates and bonds in terms of the Fed. So on the stock side of things, the earnings are definitely going to play a key role in terms of whether or not you want to dip a toe or wait into that, given what you seek going on. Because oftentimes, earnings continue to dip into the recession, and stocks don't bottom until the middle of the recession. And so if you were to dip a toe in now, you would actually be going into a potential, whereas... Wait, wait, wait, sit it again, sorry, your line cut out when you possibly be going into a potential what? Oh, a potentially losing position. Because in that case, stocks would be falling and you would be buying assets that are falling. And so you know, in terms of buying the dip, so to speak, you would probably want to wait until there was some sort of catalyst to move higher. whereas in the in the bond side of things the catalyst to move higher is the peak of hawkishness of the federal reserve when we know that uh... we're going to see definitely the peak in rates at that point you can start to get the toe i know that just Jeffrey gunlock uh... double-line is already moving in that direction well what's interesting to you and i like this line in in your analysis and reporting that about the long-standing premium for us stock staying in place because of maybe this expectations of people thinking the u.s. kind of the least hurt when it comes to the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3998,2022-10-17 19:41:07
15653," about the longstanding premium for US stocks staying in place because of maybe this expectations of people thinking the US kind of the least hurt when it comes to the economic recession and leading the way out because this is something that we have day in and day out, Tim and I with our TV colleagues and we're talking about the markets in terms of trying to understand what the right valuation is with so much uncertainty looking forward. Final thoughts here just got about 30 seconds left here Ed. Yeah, I think that the final thoughts are that there's more risk outside of the United States with the in Europe in particular with the war inflation and as a result this longstanding premium that people are paying for US stocks looks like it's going to stay in place and that's partially because recession is going to be deeper in those countries as a result. Yeah, we talked about the least dirty shirt right exactly kind of echoes what we heard from Brian Moynihan earlier with our own David Weston. Yeah, that consumer here's looking good right and you start to look right exactly right. So they're holding up session with with ammo and we'll watch for if there is a reason. Excuse me.

It is among our most red today. Let's get a check on latest world, the national news and most news in the Bloomberg Newsroom. Hey, Tim. Hey, Carol. Ukraine's foreign minister calling for sanctions on Tehran after Iranian made drones reportedly killed several people in the capital city of Kiev. The minister says sanctions would send a strong message to any country thinking about helping Russia and its war against Ukraine. It's another setback for President Biden's economic message with just over three weeks to the midterm, November midterms, the latest projections from Bloomberg economics put the chance of a recession in the next 12 months at 100%. Wendy Schiller chairs the political science department at Brown University. The Republicans are typically more unified, more coherent and they are messaging, particularly for midterm elections. And in this case, the Democrats, because they struggled so much to get their program enacted, I mean, it took a while they succeeded, but all those struggles sort of just cloud messaging opportunity. That's Brown University's Wendy Schiller speaking of Bloomberg. President Biden has repeatedly said the US will avoid a recession and any downturn will be very slight.

Yeah, scrutiny from the agencies who were talking about the commodity futures trading commission and the securities and exchange commission. Both of which declined to comment can lead to monetary fines and other penalties for firms and individuals. A lawyer listed in bankruptcy court filings as a representative for three arrows founders, Suju and Kyle Davies did not immediately respond to email and phone calls seeking comment. The inquiries were made outside local business hours in Singapore. Alright, so here's what the regulators are looking at to and when we say regulators were talking about the commodity futures trading commission and also the SEC.

15654," the SEC. They are now looking into whether the money manager violated rules by misleading investors about the strength of its balance sheet and not registering with the agencies. This was according to two people familiar with the matter. The founders were about to remain unknown. Jude didn't respond to request for comment. Davies didn't immediately respond to a message sent to him if you're Twitter. An advisory firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands Court to NEO to liquidate three arrows, which is also known as three AC also declined to comment. I mean, this is the wild run that has been anything related with crypto. I mean, this is like a big piece of when you think about the narrative of what happened over the last year. This is a major player and this is not the last we're going to be hearing about the company. No, exactly, right? As regulators continue to look into it. And I guess I don't know. Does some of it have to do with oversight and regulators not keeping up with these changing trends or is it just for management at firms and not kind of abiding by rules? Who's that? Who ends up making that determination, right? I don't know. Yes, you see the CFTC.

Hey, thanks so much for that update, Charlie Palette. It's 348 on Wall Street. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. If the Federal Reserve was hoping for some sign that inflation is subsiding, it was cruelly disabused by the latest figures for consumer prices. The headline rate fell slightly in September from 8.3% to 8.2%, but the more telling measure of core inflation reached the highest rate in 40 years. The message was clear. Far from relaxing its recent pace of monetary tightening, the Fed might have to raise interest rates faster than expected. It's tempting to think that having fallen behind the curve at the outset, the Fed should now surprise investors in the other direction by announcing an unexpectedly aggressive tightening. But this approach would all but guarantee a recession, a one that could quickly turn nasty. That makes the Fed's preference for gradualism understandable and for the moment wise.

15656, about nine point five billion dollars in assets under management david joins us once again on the phone from summit new jersey uh... so david is the worst behind us is this are returning over new leaf this week and and for the remainder of the year well we don't know whether we've seen the bottom and the cyclical downturn but we do know that the conditions are prime for better returns going forward i mean we start with the fact that we're down twenty five percent year to date on the broad market thirty five percent on the nasda that alone should wet the appetite of all bargain hunters on top of that some of the macro factors that have really beaten down stocks like a surging us dollar and surging interest rates reverse course today now the bond market has seen yields go higher for eleven weeks in a row well we know that yields don't grow to the sky and so certainly the reversal today i think really help people take more confidence that there was some limit to how high yield to be and we know that bonds compete might only for investors attention with stocks right so it's always a comparison right in terms of fixed income bonds versus what we're seeing in terms of valuations and yield on the equity side of the things having said that at this point you've got david some specific names on the equity side of things that you like and among them is tights and tells about uh... the story in the thinking behind that well you know in this part of the economic cycle we're looking for market leaders and when you look at the food category we're talking chicken we're talking be for talking pork tights and is the absolute leader they have a real lock on the domestic market outpacing their competitors like program fried and increasingly their exporting to places like china which is been battling some mind flu and so forth but we've this is a stock that you know was over about ninety dollars earlier in the year and it's come back mightily now it's got a six handle uh... and so you know you got a market leader that now trading and at less than ten times earnings a company that has a history of buying back stocks uh... buying back to stock increasing their dividend and this is the type of thing we think we're investors have gone to shower on the name and it's gonna come back okay what about uh... birch or hat the way that's uh... one of the companies on your list as well why you bullish on the picture well you can't look at the picture without thinking about war and profit of course you've got the most successful uh... investor arguably in the world uh... still in on top of the hell there you know this is a treasure trove to him of blue chip publicly trades stocks were talking coca-cola we're talking apple were taking talking american stress and of course great privately trade companies not small ones were talking burlington nor their railroad uh... guy co insurance uh... some uh... utilities in the midwest and they're trading just a little bit above book value a couple things i think are the catalyst one is of course interest rates have moved up now they're famous for having all this insurance money float some of it they put to work others have been having challenges putting to work and of course now they're getting a much better yield you ended to under three month treasury and get three point eight percent versus mill about a year ago on top of that i'd like to fact that uh... air apparent great able most likely to take over when book uh... one-buffet passes the baton just bought eighty million dollars worth of stock well he's operating in a microscope everyone in the world is looking at the timing of this pick he doesn't take throwing eighty million dollars into his stock where he's going to be moving up hopefully uh... lightly say that is a great by signal and of course if Berkshire hathaway continues to struggle they have a great record of buying back share so that gives you a bit of a four if you're worried about further volatility ahead what do you make of uh... you know it's funny we don't talk about the dial a lot because i think if it's you know limited names in the index but having said that the doubt is just down about sixteen percent this year that compares with about twenty two percent downside on the s and p five hundred and more than thirty percent as you mentioned earlier on the nasdaq one hundred for the doubt to see some out performance albeit not that much but nonetheless outperforms what does that say about you can have the down-industrials doing better than what we're seeing the broader market certainly a lot better than what we're seeing on the tech side of things well so i just talked about blue chips right liking Berkshire so i'm just wondering what what the bigger theme here is yeah it is a great question i mean frankly the doubt is lagged over the last,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4002,2022-10-17 19:57:47
15657, is talking about blue chips right liking birchers so i'm just wondering what what the bigger theme here is yeah it is a great question i mean frankly the doubt has lagged over the last decade because so much attention has been focused on money chasing those text stocks and of course those have been hit really hard the valuations got the nose bleeds levels fears of recession on top of that of course with the higher interest rates investors are discarding those stocks which have so called long dated earnings because they're marked on much lower to present value when interest rates go up the doubt is much less focused on those high uh... high valuation growth names and so i think it's been their turn in the sun you've got more companies here your banks you know for example jp morgan american express your chemical comes like that which are not only making good money now relative to stock prices but also are paying a good dividend i think as interest rates move up people gravitated towards those lower duration uh... equity names hey david before we let you go talk a little bit about inflation and what you're seeing because we got some uh... concerning comments from our mobius a little earlier today what do you what do you think is happening with inflation you know uh... so the latest numbers are terrible so there's two things i would say one is i think inflation is starting to roll over quite frankly why do i think that one is commodities tend to be a leading indicator inflation wise you look at the price of oil is got an eighty handle versus you know close to one thirty uh... late spring dido with all your other commodities as well we also are seeing distinct signs that the economy is starting to slow and when people have less money to spend companies are pulling in their belts they're not going to pay those high prices and so uh... we're going to see prices come back so i think that uh... inflation is going to tend to roll over finally stock investors are still worried about inflation i think your risk in the down side of inflation takes longer to purchase in the system right smaller than your upside if in fact we get some good news here on inflation are will certainly one take on uh... inflation and where it goes david deeds thank you so much managing principal and senior investment strategies at p-pack private wealth management roughly nine and a half billion in assets under management joining us once again on the phone from summit new jersey just a few minutes left in today's trading session we're just off our highs of the session a little bit of selling it i'm seeing as we get into the close but just still holding on to some big gains coming up next will be joined by our blueberg tv team for beyond the bell live on radio tv and you two we are counting you down the clothes on this monday beyond the bell bloombirds comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the u.s. market closed starts right now and right now we are two minutes away

send a quick welcome our bloomberg audiences across television radio as well as on youtube and carol another wild date here i mean you have the s and p up to an a percent the nasa indices up over three percent here on the day but we've been here before we were here on thursday and then of course on friday we had the exact opposite does this have legs at this is a big question at this point i've seen this movie before as well what's interesting we're seeing a little bit of rollover in these last few minutes of trading so we're coming off our best levels of the session so a little bit of selling here into the clothes but i've been kind of blown away by some of the names like meta up five point six percent amazon's been up more than six percent today same story for netflix so really some of those big fangstocks really pushing the charge ahead today tim i will see what happens when it comes to some of those earnings that we get a little later this week we did hear from david deets managing principal and senior investment strategist at p pack private wealth management just a few minutes ago he did say that valuations are favoring stocks right now and he also mentioned that inflation is starting to roll over pointing to commodity prices coming down seeing distinct signs of the economy is starting to slow which could lead to inflation coming down a bit uh... but you know have we heard this before i know i mean hsbc at a similar note this morning looking at at least seven percent inflation through january and then of course that tricky spot is uh... tim to your point commodities in the lack of demand for commodities if you start to see some of those roll over and how then quickly does that come off seven percent and you've seen that to a certain extent in the metal space i remember that most of those metals were up twenty thirty percent on a other day basis earlier this year now they're all down about fifteen twenty percent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4003,2022-10-17 20:02:15
15658," Yeah, and you've seen that to a certain extent in the metal space. So I remember most of those metals were up 20, 30% on a year to day basis. Earlier this year, now they're all down about 15, 20% here. Of course, energy hasn't quite rolled over just yet. So we'll keep an eye on that space right now, keep an eye on the closing bells here in New York. People clapping, people cheering, and they have reason to. The Dow Jones industrial average higher by more than 500 points or about 1.9%. The S&P 500 higher by about 2.7% in the NASSAC on a close higher by about 3.4%. Meanwhile, you have the Russell 2000 something that Taylor's been talking about. Some of these small cap names. The Russell closing higher by about 3.2%. And we should just point out that the mid cap, the S&P mid cap is higher by 2.8. All right, we're going to get into the groups and I know Taylor's going to go through them. But I've got to say I've been really watching some of those big banks, which were up another overall, the group overall because of earnings up another 3% in the last three trading days we've seen Taylor almost a 7% bump to the upside. Yeah, I mean, take a look at where we are on some of these sector levels. Carol, it is wild. When you think about every sector is in the green. And what is wilder is that I think we've done this a few days last week alone. And here we are again doing this again. Autocomponents, retailers up as much as 4 and a quarter to 6% media. And there's well banks have had a huge day, of course, given the better than expected, I would argue, maybe decent, of course, quarterly results from the banks. And real estate's up almost 4%. And they catch a bit from yields that finally take a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a reprieve. Otherwise, it's actually those inflationary sectors, Carol, that are the underperformers. You're only up 1%. It's household products. It's food and staples and food and beverage 1% or so on the day. Yeah, looking at all that green makes me wonder, bear market rally or are we finding a bottom hard to say? All right. As for some of the gainers, the individual gainers, there was so much for me to choose from today. I did hone in on Tesla in particular because it was top in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, up about 7%. So just off the ties of the days. And despite a story in barrens, citing a long-term Tesla estimates, saying the shares could be a zombie stock as interest rates rise. And despite Mercedes coming out with a new electric SUV that's aimed at the Tesla Model Y, keep in mind, Tesla, of course, reports on Wednesday after the market closed. So that's definitely on our radar. Roblox, also on our radar today, this stock up as much as 22% at its highs today, finishing with about a 20% gain. Giving platform, over put, a surge in September, bookings and daily active users. And what? Can I do an interruption? Do trick question for Romaine? How does he change their revenue recognition, Romaine? I don't know, Taylor. First and first out, I mean, Roblox doesn't have this life phone, iPhone or this. Thanks, Dan. Next, he doesn't involve NFTs, a carol I don't mean to interrupt. How did that? He expanded the lifeline of user engagement, which lowers revenue, but otherwise is the positive sign. You sound like a CFA charter holder? I love when you talk accounting. It makes me so happy. Well, and anyway, investors bought into it. The stock, though, 11% of the float is short. So I just want to put that out as well. And news core, remember we got the news late Friday. News core continuing to trend higher, did in the after hours on Friday, up another 3.5% today. Rupert Murdoch talking about recombining news core and Fox bringing together business that was split apart about nine days ago. So anyway, this name years ago, sorry, yeah, nine years, sorry. Did I say nine days? Yeah. Yeah, that would be really a turnaround. That would be quite a, we used the pivot, but that would be quite the pivot. Yeah, only in the UK. Nine years. All right, Tim, all your. Okay, well, Fox shares may have been higher today, or excuse me. I should know, news core shares may have been higher today. Fox shares certainly weren't finishing down by 8% today. This is analyst and investors digest that news that we got Friday about a potential reunification of news core and Fox. I can't help falling 42.5% today after the after deal reporter reported that CVS will not pursue a deal with the company at this time. And Kroger saw a few downgrades today. It felt 2.43%. We saw price target cuts at MKM, Guggenheim, and then North Coast cut it to neutral shares falling to 0.4%. Meanwhile, if you go cross asset, very little was in the red today. And then cross to commodities first and foremost, natural gas off by another 7%. We're getting some really big moves in natural gas prices here in the US, pulling low as we see perhaps demand ebbing somewhat in terms of an actually some pretty strong production. So we're seeing natural gas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4004,2022-10-17 20:06:43
15659," We're giving some really big moves in natural gas prices here in the US. Pulling low as we see, perhaps, demand ebbing somewhat in terms of, and actually some pretty strong production. So we're seeing natural gas on the downside. Oil was pretty unvolatile, I mean, a very volatile day in the likes of FX and in the likes of other key areas like stocks and bonds. We're seeing some metals roll over iron or in particular under pressure as that key speech coming from Xi Jinping in China didn't hint at any changes in tech when it comes to COVID policies. I'm looking at what happened in the Forex and the foreign exchange area because really it is strength against everything versus the dollar today. British pound up strengthening 1.6% why? Well, that you turn that finally has happened. Now the tax cuts that were likely to be given away and now being retracted by the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt. Canadian dollar was also missing some strength for Euro, missing some strength. The head of comments coming from the ECB at the moment. But really this is a story of US dollar lower as we do see maybe a little bit more risk on tone to the day, which could have been kickstarted in large part by the United Kingdom. And also so guilt come screaming down in terms of yields or by 35 basis points on the tenure as people start to buy a little bit more of the fiscal stability being talked about in the UK thus far and really buying across the more market in Europe. Well, you got a little bit of a reprieve. At least on the front end, yields are falling about four basis points or so on the two year-old, which certainly has been back in the trend of the last few months and certainly the year. But we hold on to about a level of 445 and it's been mentioning a 10 year yield that rounds out on-chon the day but holding above 4% a 402. So you can now firmly go out all the way to the yield curve even out 30 years and you're still getting over 4%. All right, I'm not quite sure where to go here because we've got a bunch of earnings. We're hearing from the big banks. I love this story that came out on the Bloomberg about all the banks are basically saying no recession, consumers doing well. So how do we kind of play that out? And I guess I'm going to wait for some of the economic news. We're going to get a lot on the housing market this week, see how bad it is and as companies, certainly in the consumer space start to report what those see. It's interesting because we did get that empire manufacturing that we did this morning and we're going to get those US industrial production numbers I think tomorrow if I remember correctly. So I'm actually kind of interested in that more as a read on what's going on in the goods producing sector. Remember last time we got those US production numbers there was sort of an imbalance if you will between what was coming out of factories and whether that was going to be enough to offset maybe a potential slowdown on the services side. I'm of course also interested in the companies that are reporting earnings. We got Johnson & Johnson, we got Hasbro, we got Lockheed Martin, Netflix, we got United Airlines, we got Tesla, the list goes on, not as many as we have next week though. But commentary from these companies will be very important. How many consumers are quitting Netflix? Have you switched to the new ad tier Tim? I have not switched to it. I'm not saying his penny is quite yet. But I don't know if it's people, I don't know, that's a good question though. I don't think it's necessarily people downgrading versus getting those people back who might have quit because they didn't want to pay that full price. Right? At the moment as you say, what is the commentary going to sound like? Is it going to be as lackluster as concerning as many of the stretches have been downgrading there? Outlooks 19 straight weeks of downgrades rather than not grades. But also the fact that was it Bloomberg economic sees a 100% chance of an recession. Now if you go out to next year and 100% chance yet that doesn't seem to be being echoed by the bank CEOs. Certainly not. It's certainly from some of these even CEOs that we're going to be hearing from the calls. We're talking to people saying they say, yeah, things are, I mean, slower than maybe they were last year. But nowhere near sort of the dire forecast and nowhere near what it would look like back in 2000. And for investors it's really, okay, so what's going on in the US market? What's going on in UK? Like does the US buy comparison look better than what's going on in Europe? And so as a result attract a lot of investor assets. I don't know if the ad tears out yet by the way. No, we have to wait a few weeks for them. It's coming. Yeah, November. And they're just testing it out at this point. He's testing you. Well, it's coming. All right. Don't worry. I just want to clarify there. All right. I mean, what do you, you're probably like a peacock guy or something ridiculous. I'm afraid to say we got all of them. He's a hulu kind of guy.

Every month, I'm like, I got to quit some of these. I know. And the thing is, every time I was like, well, I think I'm going to get rid of them. Like, no, you can't. And then every time we go to look for something, I'm like, there's nothing out there. It's everything is on. It's really sad. All right, folks, listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Monday, right now, we're the National News with Ann and the Last Two. Hey, Ann. Hey, Carol. Hey, Tim, the former launch of President Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness program kicked off today. Biden pledging his team will keep an eye on glitches and process the debt relief for those who qualify, urging them to go to studentaid.gov and apply. My commitment was, if elected president, I was going to make government work to deliver for the people. This rollout keeps that commitment. The deadline for submission is December of next year. The White House says Russia's missile strikes on Ukrainian civilians shows Putin's brutality press secretary, Karin Jean-Pierre, says President Biden is in contact with Ukrainian President Zelensky regarding the latest attacks in the U.S. will support Ukraine for as long as it takes. Early voting began in the state of Georgia today, including votes for one of the nation's most watched Senate races between current Democrats, Senator Rafael Warnoch and Republican hopeful Herschel Walker. Walker backed by former President Trump did not appear at a scheduled debate last night after Friday's intense showing. Saw Walker rebuked by the debate moderators after flashing a reportedly fake police badge during questions about his supposed previous service as a law enforcement officer. After casting his ballot at an early voting site today, Senator Warnoch urged voters to consider who they want to represent them for the next two years. The issues are too urgent. The stakes are too high and, quite frankly, the differences between me and my opponent are too wide for us to wait until election day. The people of Georgia deserve a serious person to represent them at serious times. Democratic Senator Rafael Warnoch. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Ann Mosque. This is Bloomberg. Thank you so much Ann. So we've talked about earnings. We've talked about the new streaming bundle. We've talked about all the economic news to come, recession, recession. What's the Fed going to do? If you're in a New York or in New Yorker, you got to talk about rats. Yeah, New York City is, by the way, something completely different. Are they this bad in New Jersey? Do they swim across the Hudson Carol? They do. They do backstroke. They do the backstroke too. It's bad in New York City. One of my favorite, not favorite things is sitting on a subway platform and just watching the rats on the track. Once they've actually come up on the platform and I like started to move away because they're pretty aggressive. Okay. Well, what's worse is living in the East Village like 12 years ago and walking somewhere in a rat's scurries across your foot because that's happened to me. So it's been an issue for years here. And New York City is now limiting the window for residents to take out their trash to the nighttime. It's time to cut back on the piles of garbage bags flooding its sidewalks and attracting road. It's a big reason why we see these rats. By the way, Carol, have you ever walked by a trash can? I'm not even a trash can, a trash bag and it starts moving. It's not funny. That's when there's a rat inside that trash bag. It's funny when people come to visit you in New York who haven't spent a lot of time in the city and they're like, why is there trash everywhere? And you say, oh, because that's how we've done things in New York for a century. We just put the trash on the sidewalk. Not in bins. No. You know, dumpsters like if you travel to Europe and you see big dumpsters in cities. Do you guys not put them in garbage? No, you just put them in bags. What are you doing in New York? Because I live in this side of New York. I have garbage cans and I'm in an urban environment. You just put them in bags and they collect on the sidewalk. It's pretty bad. All right. So now the city is going to change the time households and businesses are allowed to take out the trash.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4006,2022-10-17 20:15:30

All right, so now the city's going to change the time households and businesses are allowed to take out the trash to the street for collection to 8 p.m. from 4 p.m. 4 hours fewer for the buffet as we heard from Sanitation Commissioner Tish. Sorry, rats. She called it a buffet. Did she really? Yeah. Maybe it was the mayor. It just sticks with me. But it's got, and during the pandemic, people had horror stories about the rats everywhere because the normal food collection or the normal trash and stuff, I guess, wasn't out there. And so that they were scrambling big time and getting pretty brave and just out there on the streets. It's a great city, though. Welcome to the city. It is a great city, OK? Welcome to the city, Nepal. Yes, yes, it is. All right, this is Bloomberg. PLAYING",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4007,2022-10-17 20:19:58
15662," Markets, headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg.com, the Bloomberg Business Out. And at Bloomberg Quick Take. This is a Bloomberg Business Lab. On Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Palette Stock Surge, the Dow, the S&P, and NASDAQ all advancing today, ending close to session highs, S&P up to day by 94 points, a gain of 2.6%. The Dow rallied 550 points up 1.9%. NASDAQ was up 354, but NASDAQ composite index was a gain of 3.4%. Ten year up 1.32, 4.01%, the two year, 4.44%, spot gold up 3.10%, 16.49% and a retreat for crew to West Texas, intermediate crew down 1.10% to 1%. 85.52% of barrel. So big gains for US stocks today. S&P found support at a key technical level, and another giant bank of America came out with solid results. Bank of America today up by 6.1%. Tomorrow Goldman Sachs reports Goldman today up by 2.2%. Again recapping a rally on Wall Street to kick off the trading week S&P 500 index higher today by 2.65%. I'm Charlie Palette. That is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. So a lot going on when it comes to ESG, and we talk about obviously climate non-stopping. There's about three weeks to go into the start of COP27. That's going to happen in Egypt. And the need to urgently address the climate crisis has never been clearer. Pakistan and Nigeria have experienced devastating flooding this year. Europe, as you know, sweltering in a record heat wave over the summer and Kenya and Somalia have been ravaged by a catastrophic drought, which makes you think about the big macro climate issues that are going on and then how it impacts the investment climate. And how do we measure climate impact? That's a big question I think that a lot of people have when it comes to not just their own companies, but also investments that they make. You've got Laura Zizzo with us. She's co-founder and CEO of Manifest Climate. It's a SaaS climate-risk planning solution. She joins us on the phone from Atlanta this afternoon. Laura, how are you? I'm well. Thanks. How are you? Yeah, we're doing well thanks. Thanks for joining us on this. Can you explain what exactly Manifest Climate measures? What tools do you have and what data points do you use to measure climate impact? Right. So we know that we're going through climate transformation just like we went through our digital transformation, but I say we're in this pre-HTML era of climate change. We need a common language so we know how to navigate this climate transformation. And we think by pulling information from public deflosures of publicly traded companies, how they're talking about climate change, we can help understand how they're moving through that transformation. It's much more complex when just understanding their greenhouse gas emissions. It's about their processes and their policies of integrating these climate-related growth and opportunities into core business. So can you be more specific like give us up for example when this company talks about this, how that translates into data or useful information on your platform? Right, absolutely. So we know that some of our asset manager clients for instance are looking for proxies, for good governance related to climate. So we'll look for things like how they're talking about what committees of the board are thinking about climate change, who's in charge from a cease-weir management level. And we can categorize all of this into action items and help organizations to understand where they sit in their climate competency. So we're looking for specific language around what governance is the company have, how they're integrating risk management into core business strategy. So if you have an enterprise risk management strategy, how exactly are climate risks and opportunities identified and integrated into that? So what do you mean by that? Yeah, so if you're real estate investment trust for instance, like we've known for a long time that there's operational issues related to energy use. But we also need to think about how are you thinking about where these assets are located and what risks related to the climate impacts can be integrated. So are you thinking about future storm surge and how you're thinking about infrastructure improvements related to that? And are you talking about that with clarity so investors can feel like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4008,2022-10-17 20:23:44
15663," So are you thinking about future storm surge and how you're thinking about infrastructure improvements related to that? And are you talking about that with clarity? So investors can feel like you've got your eye on this problem and you can think about how you're going to shore up resiliency into the future. But do you think the market prices those things in from a real estate perspective? I think about that a lot because we hear about just, you know, for the last year so many people moving to Florida, for example, Skyhide prices in California as well, a place that's really affected by a drought in the lack of water. And it doesn't seem like, you know, we know these things, but it doesn't seem like the market is pricing these things in. Exactly. I think that's what organizations like Manifest Climate are trying to, the problem we're trying to solve. How do we actually connect the dots so that market can actually price this in and make better decisions? And investors are increasingly asking these kinds of questions. They need to understand how you're preparing for this long-term value creation. But I think that the answer is no right now or not adequately pricing this in. So we're seeing more and more tools out there to give that proxy for the price signals that we're looking for in the market. Hey, Laura. So what do the companies that you work with or asset managers that you're working with do with this information? Is it how they base their investment decisions or more broadly, how are they using the information ultimately? Yeah. It's becoming a competitive advantage to understand that. So one of our asset managers, clients, that they're actually seeing alpha related to good governance disclosure. So it's not as simple as saying these companies are the ones we're going to focus on, but they're looking for these sort of proxies for good governance. And they're also looking for clarity in the transition plans. We talked a lot about, are you thinking about how you're going to transition to net zero? We've seen a lot of ambition, right? Either you've seen things that you say, yeah, totally. Totally. You're about 20-50. But they're looking for specifics like, what are you doing now? Is this more than lip service? And if there's a clear understanding as we're doing something right now, it's not good enough. No one's doing good enough on this. But we have something to say that's more than just ambition. That's what investors are looking for. And they're going to start holding these companies to some of their plans. Can you give us a few companies that are doing this really well? You know, more and more. I would say Microsoft is a really great example. When they came up with their carbon pledge, they said, we really want to think about how our business will help transition. And I would say this is not philanthropic on their part, right? They see this as a business opportunity. The Bank of America just said, and I heard right before the segment, you're talking about the Bank of America, they're saying there's $132 million that needs to move as we get to net zero. So companies like Microsoft say, we need to be part of that transition. How can we help move to that net zero future? And they actually have a business strategy aligned with that. So that's the type of things that investors are looking for. Now it's definitely a part of, you feel like, increasingly so because of the impact climate change is having on our world the costs that it definitely is having a bigger say, if you will, and having some kind of platform that can identify it really makes a lot of sense. Hey, Laura, thank you so much. Laura's is a co-founder, chief executive officer of Manifest Climate. They work with companies to track and report on climate change. Laura, by the way, a former delegate to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. She's also a lawyer. So good to catch up with her. But this is, you know, I can just see more momentum around what she was talking about. Once again, then I go back to the example that you and I talk about that when, in we're learning season right now, investors don't punish companies this necessarily for their environmental impact right now. We talk about bottom line. We talk about top line and we see shares of a company move as a result of those reports, but we don't hear about carbon output, for example. No, exactly, right? And unless you're penalized, like you do wonder, I don't know, how it really plays out in the public markets. All right, folks, we're going to continue right here on Bloomberg Business.

Sirius XM, Channel 119 and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business App and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. So if you're a loyal listener and watcher, which we certainly hope you are a Bloomberg Business Week, you know one of the things Tim and I like doing is getting down to the local level and that means talking with mayors around the country. Yeah, we're going to be joining just a few minutes by Mattie Parker, the mayor of Fort Worth, Texas. Got a lot of questions about why everybody's moving to Texas and what she's seeing there. Including crypto, would you brought to her attention? Yeah. They're doing some crypto stuff. We'll get to that in just a moment. First up, back to your toppizzas stories and look at that. Raleigh and Wall Street on this Monday. Here's Charlie. Indeed, what a day on Wall Street here. Start of the new trading week with the Dow, the S&P, Nesdaq, all surging, surging big time today with the S&P up 94 gain there of 2.65%. The Dow up today by 551 points. That was a gain of 1.9%. The Nesdaq composite index up 354 up 3.43%. The Nesdaq 100 index up 3.5%. Broad based rally, how strong was it you ask? It was so strong that at one point over 99% of companies in the US equity benchmark were moving higher. So raise us a question. Have we seen the bottom for stocks this year? David Deetz has seen your investment strategist at P-PAC Private Wealth Management. He was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. We don't know whether we've seen the bottom in this cyclical downturn. But we do know that the conditions are primed for better returns going forward. I mean, we start with the fact that we're down 25% year to date on the broad market. 35% on the Nesdaq. That alone should wet the appetite of all bargain hunters. And today the 10 year yielding 4.01%. The two year yielding 4.44%. Spot gold up $5.00 yhz to 16.50 again. There were four tenths of 1%. Down day for West Texas, intermediate crew down another 1.10th of 1%. 85.56 a barrel. American Airlines passengers averaged a federal court to preliminaryly approve a deal that would pay at least $7.5 million to fully refund baggage fees to customers who've been promised they could check their bags at no cost. Today we had airlines flying higher for the most part. American up by 7.10th of 1% of course of big operations at Dallas Fort Worth. UAL of 1.9% delta, 2 tenths of 1% Southwest down 1.10th of 1%. Jeb Blue rallied 2.7%. I'm Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you. Well earlier this year, Blueberg News reported on how Fort Worth Texas, which is the fifth largest Texas municipality, was jumping on the crypto banwag and approving a plan to mine Bitcoin with computers located in City Hall. The move according to Fort Worth would make it the first city government in the U.S. to mine Bitcoin. We got the mayor of Fort Worth Texas with us right now. Mattie Parker, she joins us via Zoom from Fort Worth Texas. Mayor Mattie, good to have you with us. How are you? Thanks, Carol. Thanks Tim. Good to be with you. Well, let's start with Bitcoin because Carol so elegantly told us at the top there that you guys became the first city to mine your own Bitcoin from City Hall. Give us an update there. How's it going? It's actually been a really interesting pilot program.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4011,2022-10-17 20:36:52
15666," You guys became the first city to mine your own Bitcoin from City Hall. Give us an update there. How's it going? It's actually been a really interesting pilot program for the city of Fort Worth. We'll get an update from City staff in the next few weeks. But really the thanks goes to Texas Blockchain Council for helping make it possible. We had this machine's donated to help it be at no cost, attacks, payers able to plug them into City Hall and just really try to be on the forefront of the learning curve of what cryptocurrency really means in this country right now. And also blockchain technology and be a city that's welcome to innovation. We do know that crypto mining, specifically Bitcoin mining, uses a ton of energy. It's not a technical term, but it uses a lot of energy. We did see some miners taken off the grid during recent power crises in Texas. Did you guys have to disconnect the computers at all at times over the summer when you had to turn the air conditioning up really high? Willie, the lucky thing for us, we're part of our IT departments. They make those decisions based on what they would do with the rest of our IT equipment and any kind of surge scenario. So in our situation, they just followed along the same lines as what city staff recommended. So we didn't really have it. We have only three machines. So we're a pretty small dent in what you probably have seen across major mining operations in the cross the country. All right, so wait. So I know when we reported on it, the computers are located in City Hall. And so it's three mining rigs that you said donated by the Texas Blockchain Council. Why are you guys doing this? Well, you know, honestly, Fort Worth wants to be known as synonymous with innovation and technology. And this is an opportunity for us to get notice in the right ways. And truthfully, it worked. I mean, we had over 780 million impressions across the globe about what Fort Worth was doing and got new inquiries from other technology companies, even if they really weren't involved in cryptocurrency to ask the question, hey, if you're willing to do this and take a risk so to speak and work alongside other technology companies, what would you be, what would you willing to do in the future as well? So that's the real why behind the city of Fort Worth. And again, you know, cryptocurrencies, one piece of this, the future of blockchain technology in a multitude of different industries is something I personally very interested in and want to make sure Fort Worth's at the part of the conversation. Okay. So you know that this, we know that the city is planning to re-evaluate the program after six months. It's been about six months. What does that re-evaluation look like? And is there a chance that the city would abandon this? Absolutely. And anything could be abandoned at any point. It's a pilot program for reason. That's what we promised to city officials to kind of understand what the advantages were and what the program should evolve into importantly. Is it just mining Bitcoin? And do we need a more robust program in the future to really be meaningful? And I think that's the point we're at right now to kind of determine what next steps are. The Texas blockchain council has been immensely helpful and expertise that they offer. So it's interesting. So talk to us about, you know, it sounds like you and so many other cities are thinking about things to attract people coming in. Tell us about the folks that have been coming into your city specifically. What kind of, who are they coming from and how many? Yeah. Well, good question. So, I think the fourth experience is 328 people moving here every single day, which is hard people to believe. We don't have a problem attracting folks to Fort Worth. So it's important we really understand what it looks like as you're attracting new talent to our cities. How do you also attract the businesses and jobs to come along with those? And also be responsive to the amount of growth that we're seeing in the Fort Worth region. You know, North Texas and Dallas Fort Worth region will soon pass Chicago is the third largest metro in the entire country. So being in front of the infrastructure needs is incredibly important. But honestly, during COVID, you saw this across the entire country, people moving to where they wanted to experience quality of life. Unfortunately for us in Fort Worth, we do have that and it's a place we do want to raise your family or build your business. Mayor Parker, Mayor Maddie, where are they coming from? Is it the East Coast or where you're finding that they're coming from? Well, in Texas, yeah, good question. About Texas, about half the migration is domestic migration across the United States. A lot of from coastal cities, places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Seattle, those are some pretty predominant communities. But also about 50% of the growth is natural. You know, new babies being born across Texas and people having additional family members can join them. So I think it's a mixture of both the two. I think here in Fort Worth, you're seeing most people, they could work from anywhere, they could move their companies and you're seeing more tax invasive states be a place they're fleeing from. And Texas is an incredibly welcoming, open for business type environment. So I think you're seeing some lot of success here in North Texas because of that. Mayor Maddie, we only have 45 seconds left. We're going to come back with you in just a few minutes. You know, Carol, actually, let's chat about what we're going to talk about with the mayor in just a few minutes when we come back. Questions about who is coming, specifically when it comes to, okay, our company's relocating or these people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4012,2022-10-17 20:41:28
15667," Let's chat about what we're going to talk about with the mayor in just a few minutes when we come back. Questions about who is coming, specifically when it comes to, okay, our company is relocating or these people who are able to work remotely now. That's something I want to try to get to the bottom of. Yeah, and I'm curious too about upcoming elections and the political climate and how that shapes into strategy and her plans and strategy in terms of growth going forward. So a lot more to get to as we said, we love catching up with mayors around the United States. We're talking with Fort Worth mayor, Maddie Parker. She is the 45th mayor of Fort Worth and we're going to continue our conversation in just a moment. In the meantime, let's get a check on the latest world and national news with Ann Mosque in the Big Newsroom. Hey, Tim. Hey, Carol. As we head into the final weeks before the midterm elections, Georgia's incumbent Democratic Senator Rafael Warnock is leading against challenger, Hershel Walker. That's according to our forecasters at 538 who called Georgia the likelyest tipping point for control of the Senate. Here's 538's Galen Druke. Right now, Democrats have a two and three chance of holding control of the Senate. Republicans have a one and three chance. If Warnock wins, Democrats odds go up significantly. Of course, if Walker wins, Republicans odds go up significantly. Again, that's 538's Galen Druke. Ukraine's foreign minister is calling for sanctions on Tehran after Iranian-made drones reportedly killed several people in the capital city of Kiev. The minister says sanctions would send a strong message to any country, thinking about helping Russia in its war against Ukraine. House prices are holding steady to start off the week Triple A puts today's nationwide average for a cost of Galen of regular unleaded at $3.88. That's unchanged from yesterday. And Halloween candy prices are getting a little scarier this year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, you can expect to pay about $2 more for a typical large bag of candy this year. The biggest yearly jump in candy prices that the CPI has ever recorded. And tonight at 707, it's game 5 of New York Yankees face the Cleveland Guardians at Yankee Stadium, the winner heads to Houston for game 1 of the best of 7-A-L championship series on Wednesday night against the Astros.

Alright Ann, thank you so much Ann Mosque there with Roll the National News. We're going to get back to the mayor of Fort Worth, Maddie Parker. We'll get back to her in just a moment. In the meantime, there is a story we didn't get to so far. We wanted to mention it was actually I think trending pretty highly when it comes to social media, which kind of makes sense. The rapper formerly known as Kanye West has agreed to buy parlor, a social media platform that has been embraced by conservatives who departed Twitter over allegations of political censorship. I didn't know it was called parliament technologies. Did you know that either? No, and that's the parent coming behind parlor announcing today that it plans to sell the social media platform to the hip hop icon for an undisclosed amount. The deal would include technical support from parliament such as cloud services. Yeah, he is buying. Yeah, Kanye. Yeah, what he's known as now. He's buying his own social media platform at a time when the biggest tech firms are struggling without a control and manage some of their largest users. It marks the continuing development of alternative social media sites. Let's go through some of these sites, Carol. We got Twitter, which is right now in the process of being acquired by Elon Musk. Haven't talked about him today yet, have we? That happened. Yeah, all right. So we'll try to keep it that way. We've done it yet. Until we have the show's not over yet. And then you have parlor and then you have true social, president Trump's social network. So if we think about what's happening with social networks, there's at least a desire by many wealthy individuals to create spaces for conservatives. Well, and this is coming in the face of more and more restrictions by various social media platforms. Yeah, we know has recently faced restrictions from the major social media platforms for breaking content policies. Twitter removed an anti-Semitic tweet from him last week and blocked his accounts just one day after he returned to the platform for the first time in nearly two years. Instagram has also deleted posts. So increasingly folks where they are being blocked are looking for alternative spaces. On social to put out their views. There's another one, rumble. It's a conservative video network backed by billionaire Peter Tiel and VC and Republican Senate candidate JD Vance. He's running in Ohio, being a publicly traded company through a deal with a blank check firm. What about this to me is then you create these vacuums.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4013,2022-10-17 20:45:38
15668," You see in Republican Senate candidate JD Vance, he's running in Ohio, being a publicly traded company through a deal with a blank check firm. What's sad about this to me is that you create these vacuums of people with the same thought, rather than a platform that has different points of view and everybody gets to kind of play around with it. Oftentimes I just see repost of President Trump's true social posts on Twitter anyway. Yeah, that's a good point. All right, we're gonna get back to the mayor of Fort Worth in just a moment.

I want to get right back to our guest and delighted to still have with us. From Fort Worth, Texas via Zoom, the 45th mayor of Fort Worth, Fort Worth mayor, Matty Parker. So mayor, Matty, I am curious about the political climate. And you have taken positions that are against the kind of Republican thought, if you will. And it feels like more open-minded, whether it's about transgender kids or other issues. So does that make things difficult for you? It honestly doesn't. I mean, I've always been known as someone that speaks by mine. I think I was pretty honest about that when I ran for mayor. I just want to be known as a mayor for all people that's really welcoming city, which I know that we are, and try to turn the political temperature down a bit. I think the matter, if you're far left or far right, I just don't think that's how you govern. And it's certainly not my mentality as a mayor of a large growing city. And so truthfully, it's actually made my job easier. People are more approachable. And I always agree on things. My role is to be a compromised agent. And that's absolutely how I operate here at City Hall and working alongside my city council members. Is it frustrating you to see some of the positions that prominent Republicans take nationally when you, and you get concerned about being painted with that brush? I think about questions about the election of 2020, for example, or what happened on January 6th. Or even abortion potentially. So I think for me, I actually decided to run for office here in mayor of Fort Worth in 2021, right after January 6th. So I was heartbroken as were most Americans at the situation and what happened in our nation's capital and what that means for our democracy. And I've been pretty open about that. But again, my role is really to try to be forward looking on behalf of not just the residents of Fort, but the residents of Texas. I think of myself, obviously, there's been a lot of conversation about my age. I'm 30 years old and mother to three children. My husband, I live here in Fort Worth. I thought I have a really good pull somewhat's happening in my community. And regardless on maybe the topic and how contentious it may or may not be, I try to have a listening ear. And again, turn the temperature down. What you see on social media, sometimes it's portrayed in the media is oftentimes not how you actually have to interact with people and listen to their ideas and positions to really get things done. Well, we're, in terms of, since we've got midterms just around the corner, and then of course, we're going to have a presidential election. You guys have a gubernatorial race. Is, you know, a governor Abbott versus a governor of Rorck is one thing better for you in terms of your city, in terms of strategy going forward? It's really not. I mean, I think both, both, both governor candidates, obviously, governor Abbott. And I don't have a relationship with Mr. Erorck, but to understand what they are going to really do on behalf of Texas cities, we're fast growing infrastructure and mobility needs are significant investments in education, understanding all those things are really important to me as mayor. And also as a mom here in Texas. So I'm just like every other text and watching that raised fully closely and looking forward to the election being over in November. I hear you. I think a lot of people are looking forward to that. Absolutely. Do you ever think about potentially?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4015,2022-10-17 20:54:19
15670," that raised really closely and looking forward to the election being over in November. I think a lot of people are looking forward to that. Absolutely. Do you ever think about potentially changing to an independent or over concerns about the national role of the political party or questions about Republican party identification when you're going out and meeting voters? I don't have to think about it right now. I get to run as a nonpartisan elected official, which is really special and allows me a lot of room. I will say I've always been a Republican and a conservative work for Republicans. The conservative ideals are something I really hold dear and important or kind of how I govern. But at the same time, I maybe y'all don't know about me. I was raised in a really small town in Texas where you just take care of one another and I try to lead with that first open-minded approach in any kind of role. I just honestly don't have time to worry about it. It sounds silly, but this job is full-time and then some plus being a mom. I'm just not interested in being involved in partisan politics right now. Right. No, and I appreciate you weighing in on this. I want to go back to your city and what's kind of top of mind because the US Census has said you guys are the second fastest growing city in the United States and you've certainly got into some of the reasons why with the inflow of people coming in, almost 330 every day you say. So top of mind in terms of growth, you talk about infrastructure, where do you want to spend money? Where do you want to spend your tax dollars on? So we're actually investing about $3.5 billion in mobility projects across Fort Worth and Tarant County right now and that's in partnership between the city, Tarant County, our MPO, nor Texas, nor Central Texas Council of Governments and TechS. So I'm really proud of that planning process that started well before I was mayor and continues today as first and foremost. Of course, affordable housing across the region and kind of keep up with that growth and different types of products for families across the area. And then educational opportunities making sure we have high quality education from cradle all the way to career has always been a priority for me and priority, priority mayor and that continues today. What about when it comes to public safety because cities around the country are facing an issue that Fort Worth is also facing as well, rising homicide rates. And I'm wondering what specifically you're doing in order to bring crime down in Fort Worth. So first of all, we're making the right investments in our police department. We are pro police and pro community at the same time. I'm really proud to tell you that we're adding 53 sworn officers in this year's budget that was just approved along with about 20 civilian positions to support our police department. That's patrol division, but also in our police divisions, such as our CIT team, which is our crisis intervention team to help with mental health issues, our hope team with help of our homeless population. These investments matter also making sure we're really focused on recruitment and retaining top talent that deserve to be police officers in our city. We're very fortunate. We have a community that really appreciates our police officers works alongside them, shows them how much we care and appreciate the work that they do on behalf of our residents. And that really shows up in how we're able to attract police officers into our cadet program. So all that holistically is focused on public safety. The last thing I'll say is I'm not a police officer. I don't have the expertise of law enforcement. I have a very close relationship with our chief chief, Neil Noakes in our department listening to his command staff and understanding what they need to fight, felony crime, especially our homicide and aggravated assault rate that has continued to rise in the city. And I think we're going to be a real example for this country over the next year and what we're doing right. All right. So Tim and I both have the same question. Go ahead, Tim. Is it mayor Maddie now? Then Senator Maddie or Senator or governor Maddie in the next 10 years? Guys, I got a six-year-old, right? I'm just barely surviving. I'm more worried about I forgot to order grocery yesterday. I got to figure that out tonight and what kind of cost. We've all been there. Right? You've all been there exactly. So I'm pretty proud to be mayor of this city right now. And it's a dream job for sure. But it's a long, red way. I've got a lot of family in Texas. I'm going to start grilling them about you. OK. Do what they say. And then let me know, Carol. I'm kind of curious what my reputation is. Just really curious. But I mean, do you think about that politics you're going to be in it for a long time? Look, here's the thing. Our democracy is the reason this country exists. Freedom is not free. I'm so proud to be an American and a Texan. And I think I get frustrated sometimes when it's so easy to be armchair quarterback and joke about our politicians or elected officials and all levels of government when it's incredibly important. It's literally how this country was founded. And so if I get to be an elected official and be mayor of a city like this, I'm pretty proud of that. What's next? Who knows? I'm going to be desired.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4016,2022-10-17 20:58:40
15671," when it's incredibly important, it's literally how this country was founded. And so if I get to be an elected official and be mayor of a city like this, I'm pretty proud of that. What's next? Who knows? I might be tired of politics at some point and go back into the private sector, or maybe I wanna keep on this pathway, but I just need to do a good job for the residents of Fort Worth and that's where I'm focused right now. Mayor Parker, that six-year-old eventually goes to high school and then they don't want anything to do with you. I'm just gonna tell you. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Come back soon, let us know how things are going. We would love to check in with you again. Maddie Parker, she's the mayor of Fort Worth, Texas, joining us via Zoom from Fort Worth, Texas. Good show. Yeah, great stuff. That's it, guys. Have a great evening. Good night. From the heart of where innovation, money, and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. I'm Caroline Hyde in New York. I'm in for Emily Chang. This is Bloomberg Technology. Coming up in the next hour, Netflix kicks off big tech earnings Tuesday, followed by Tesla and of course Snap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4017,2022-10-17 21:02:45
15672," I'm Caroline Hyde in New York. I'm in for Emily Chang. This is Bloomberg Technology. Coming up in the next hour, Netflix kicks off big tech earnings, Tuesday followed by Tesla and of course Snap. How low is the bar already set this quarter and Will Stocks continue to fall even after earnings beats the turn around today of course. Plus Kanye West or Yez is now known. Buies a social media platform that has embraced by conservatives who departed Twitter over allegations of political censorship. We're talking with the CEO of parlour about the deal and Texas needs more details from FTX and Sam Mankman freeds deal to buy voyages assets. We'll have more on the investigation into the crypto mogul. First and foremost, we're going to get started with the markets. With the stock surging money, traders snapping up tech shares ahead of key earnings. Pretty much Ed Luddlow, he got the key move as Ed. Yeah, it was an interesting session wasn't it tech really outperforming the Nasdaq 100 having its best day since July and for all the Fed speak I suppose and economic risk. We are turning very quickly our attention towards earnings. It was kind of this broader risk off mentality I suppose but yields kind of didn't move as much as one might expect. But the big outperformance coming in the Nasdaq 100, I think what's so interesting is we're actually going to ease into it a little bit Caroline. Look at in terms of market cap at least in the technology sector and the S&P 500 that reports this week. It's a slower start, Netflix, Tesla, Snap as we mentioned and it's the week beginning October 24th where you start to get the mega caps coming in with their numbers but what's clear is the expectations have really come down earnings revisions picked up steam in recent weeks. Which is two ways looking about it. The optimist in me says well with those earnings revisions the but the lot but bars pretty low right in terms of having to clear hurdles. So as we said in the intro to this whole show where do you go if it's you have a beat or a miss how much movement will there be on any surprise it was interesting specific movies that we got on Monday as well the mega caps kind of led the charge but Tesla up 7% pretty significant gain but not enough of course to reverse the losses that we saw Friday that stock dropped 7.6% of Friday. But also netflix as well really outperforming up 6.5% going into this any season it's a weird one to get your head around expectations are low but at least we started the week brightly. As long as you're along the market so well observed earlier on Twitter let's have a talk a little bit more about well the on again off again risk on risk off. Sort of violent moves we see in the market and whether any of the valuations are currently at a buying opportunity Dan Morgan I'm pleased to say is with us. So no this trust portfolio manager Dan before we get into the nitty gritty of the earnings what you expect just at these levels the whipsawing we do see day in day out are you ultimately thinking that the erosion in value does mean that we're at some sort of buying point in growth stocks. Well Carol I don't know if we can put the flag in the sand and say we're at a buying point but just kind of reiterate what you're talking about earlier I mean going into this. Upcoming third quarter the consensus right now is calling for the overall technology sector to drop an earnings by about 7% the semi conductors which we've talked about before with. And video and micron last couple weeks that's expected drop 14% so I think the expectations are so low that if they get any growth out of any of the fangs stocks. Including Netflix even as top line growth I think people would be pretty happy so but I still think we got to work through these fed increases before we can draw the line the sand and say okay here's the inflection point we can move on and start feeling really positive about tech. Interesting so the macro dictates the micro at the moment but talk to us about the micro talk to us first and foremost about netflix who kicks off what are you expecting any sort of steer on on resilience from a consumer right now. We have to bear in mind Caroline the netflix is reported two consecutive quarters of negative subscriber growth coming into this quarter we're looking for a little over a million new subscribers we know they're talking about going to a new platform in terms of advertising revenue how's that going to affect them they've been. Working on their password sharing issues I think the big bogey Caroline to be honest with the going this quarter netflix is do you know a consensus is for the fourth quarter looking for four million new subscribers to me that seems a little bit high yeah yeah notable that we're still being very bullish perhaps with this new advertising models and they're like I'm interested in what you think of of tesla which of course in many ways is so retailed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4018,2022-10-17 21:07:09
15673," Yeah, notable that we're still being very bullish perhaps with those new advertising models and they're like I'm interested in What you think of of Tesla which of course in many ways is so retail dictated and has been very prone to just being moved as a stock on sentiment But what do you like to see in terms of a steer on growth on a particularly as we see the more competition come in Mercedes for example the news there today? Caroline we don't follow Tesla Unfortunately because it is an auto stock it doesn't fit in our bracket in terms of technology So I really I'm for you. I don't have much to add I apologize for that and been a bit of a misfire in steer Thank you for bearing with me. Let's talk a little bit though about where you are going to be guiding a light IBM For example, this is company that that has been relatively a positive relatively in growth mode But are you likely to see the corporate side of demand stay resolute? Yeah, Caroline so IBM's interesting because they had a pretty good number on the last quarter their second quarter Coming into this third quarter there are concerns about how wage growth is going to impact their consulting business They're expected to take on about an eight percentage point Negative impact from from currency But if you look at their model, it's kind of interesting because they generate about 75% of their business from software and consulting and about 50% of their revenues are reoccurring So there are very high cash flow stock would be something your listeners could look at the dividend is over 5% And it's only down 13% year-to-date where the S&P is down 25 so look at IBM as a value stock with very good cash flow What has been so interesting is over the last couple of earnings seasons snap has almost dictated sentiment needing then into the Metas into the other Googles and the likes that are focused on advertising as a model We've seen them become a sort of bellweather are you expecting them to be that this week and to the upside of the downside? We're right Caroline last quarter they came out and it dictated trading with Twitter with Google with Amazon Everybody followed them meta. We have to remember the second quarter revenues were only up 13% and they guided for third quarter revenues to be flat But since then things have improved a little bit. They're actually looking for revenues to grow 6% They've had challenges as you know Caroline in terms of the change in privacy with Apple They've also had competitive issues with TikTok, but you're right Caroline They're a company that's going to dictate what happens with alphabet Twitter and meta in terms of advertising revenue online and how that health of that business is going and of course you have Twitter exposure as well Is Twitter going to be anything but the story of M&A or are you actually going to be really focusing on fundamentals? Caroline Twitter's a tough company because they don't seem to ever grow their subscriber base It's been very flat. You've got all the hype about Elon Musk wanting to buy the company and change it around But if you look at their core growth trajectory It's been very benign compared to let's say a snap or a meta or an alphabet over let's say the last five years So they still have a lot of challenges not only in the overall ad spend market which is expected slow this year Only to about 16% from 36% last year But they have issues in terms of how they're structured their average user time is only about 45 seconds or about two minutes Compared to Facebook or meta that was 30 minutes to give you an idea of how long people stay on it and actually look at it It's usually a quick interchange. So that's another challenge for Twitter going forward So it's going to be a tough quarter I would expect for them We want to thank you so much for giving us your expertise your years of experience and managing money and getting into the right stocks and over Strusticles but phony manager there we thank him meanwhile Well, we're just talking about Twitter. It's a lot of competition within the space Maybe even more the social medias that are focused on conservative voices. Yay.

Of course that's a social media platform that's been embraced by conservatives who perhaps have left Twitter over allegations of political censorship. Parliament technology CEO, that's the parent company of parlor, is George Farmer. He oversees currently the happenings joining us now for the future. First of all, what does he bring you? Because you're still going to be doing the underlying technology if I'm right. So what does he bring in leadership, in ownership? Yeah, well, thanks Caroline for having me on. I think he brings a vision to the platform that is much needed. You've seen the rise of personalities surrounding social media apps, whether it be Elon Musk and Twitter or Donald Trump and truth social. I think that parlor very much looks to a charismatic leader and I think that we're in the A we have one who is going to take the platform forward in terms of vision and direction both creatively from a marketing perspective from an outreach perspective. I think he's going to bring a lot of necessary creative talent to the platform. We're excited to work with him. And of course it puts us back on the map, which is something that we've long aspired to be back on. Well, you worried about not being on the map. Have you been losing members or users? Well, I think it's fair to say that the competitive landscapers become a lot more competitive when parlor was found founded in 2018. It really was the only kind of what I quote, sort of free speech as a business social media app around. And of course in the intervening four to five years, that landscapers become that much bit more competitive. And it leads the leadership of a charismatic personality, you know, much as I like to compliment myself as sort of being a charismatic leader, it's, it's just a different game when it comes to outreach and presence in existing, in existing social media apps. So, you know, Kanye is obviously he plays presence on Instagram and Twitter is is enormous. And his outreach is is global. And as a result, this puts us into a position where he can help accelerate the brand growth and he can grow the platform into something that he wants it to be as well as, as well as complement our existing technology infrastructure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4020,2022-10-17 21:15:30
15675," team and for sure she obviously has a relationship with Kanye, they talk very extensively about culture, you know she's deep in the trenches on various cultural aspects including of course, why into his fashion show Paris a couple of weeks ago and so you know I wouldn't have had my introduction to Yef it wasn't for her, you know the negotiation of the deal itself of course has completely left to me and you know I'm more of that aspect of our life, the technology aspect, the business aspect she has her own business ventures which are highly successful, she's a very successful business woman in her own rights and so she brought him into the into the conversation but you know the deal itself was negotiated by me. What about deals of the future we've just seen a tweet put out by Elon Musk an amusing one an interesting one a thought provoking one but him and Ye becoming some sort of team in some way with him as Twitter and Ye with parlour what do you make of that is that a future you'd want for the company you built? Yeah I mean I think that I was highly entertained to see that that tweet obviously look strategic partnerships on the table absolutely. I said this morning I think in a in a comment that I gave that we are at the the end of the beginning of the start of the Patriot economy right with the end of the beginning of the Patriot economy this is I think it I think in the last five years you've seen a massive land grab in terms of companies launching and trying to take positioning in this space you know you're not seeing it in banking you're seeing it in social media you're seeing it in payment processing you're seeing it in everything from insurance to coffee I mean to everything in the world and I think what's happening now is that the space has become quite crowded and you're going to see consolidation I think you're potentially going to see more M&A in this space and I think that's going to be very exciting. The decision is now Ye's you know and and we are excited to work with him on that possibility there's absolutely a possibility that he could want to turn the company around and and and sell it and make it something part of much bigger or in turn he could be looking for acquisitions himself that's a discussion that I have yet to have with him so I think this is very exciting George appreciate the time thank you George Farmer Parliament Technologies CEO meanwhile of course we've been talking about social media the landscape Peter Till has been backing some of those new entrants to the conservative social media platform area meanwhile and German startup delivering drones to Ukraine just got a big boost from one of Elon Musk's close partners quantum systems has received 17.5 million dollars in new funding from investors including billionaire Peter Till. Till says quantum systems is leaps ahead of the competition it supplied at least 42 drones to support the Ukraine army coming up Instacart has latched its valuation multiple times this year is the coveted unicorn status on being well deemed across at the moment killed in the world a big tech we have to work out where the unicorn should really be a name anymore my next guest thinks so this is Bloomberg",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4021,2022-10-17 21:22:45
15676," To prihhhh whack dawg Our next guest says that by 2024 we'll have redefined the term unicorn entering perhaps a Darwinian era for the tech sector. Greg Martin is venture capitalist behind companies, including GoPro, HubSpot and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities, one of the largest platforms for trading shares of private tech companies. Now, first of all, we'll walk us through before we get to Darwinism, talk to us about why unicorn maybe then term doesn't make sense. Well, Caroline, thank you for having me. You know, if you look at the end of 2021, we had over a thousand what we call uniform private technology companies that are market caps in excess of a billion, which represented about 4.3 trillion of market cap, just unprecedented levels of size of companies. Now, certainly there's a lot of great companies in that thousand that do deserve to have the billion plus market cap and those companies will go public and be large companies in the public markets someday. But a good percentage of them got way out over their skis on valuation. And, you know, partially because investors were chasing yield, they were looking for growth and they were looking for the next snowflake, if you will. And the problem is there are very few companies that really can aspire to those kinds of heights. And I think that's why we're going to see a lot of these companies not sustain unicorn status in the future. Well, we see them fading. Do we see more M&A? Do we see what does Darwinism look like for you? A Darwinian error in that respect? Well, listen, I think I think you will see that there are truly companies that are of the size and scale and market leadership that will go public and they will grow their valuations. I think there are a lot of these companies that unfortunately, you know, their valuations were set very high. Their businesses are still sub-scale. They were given a lot of cash to grow, grow, grow. And the reality is the growth just isn't there for some of these businesses. And I think those businesses will struggle to ever become profitable. And so I think for those people, and I think there's a good number of companies that are fit in that category. They will be looking for a home. I think the private financing markets are drying out for some of these companies. And so they will be looking for a home. Now, the good news is many of them have great products. And there will, there is going to be a very vibrant M&A market, I believe, in the next two years. Okay. M&A, maybe at rather better valuations than previously for the buyer at least. I'm interested, therefore, as the seller and as a talent member in these companies that are suddenly eroding their market value, suddenly people who have been promised certain exits or certain liquidity moments or indeed being paid in shares, how does that look like for them? What does this mean for the talent going forward? It's a big problem. And you can see some companies are being very proactive about that, you know, Instacart, for example, that they just, you know, lowered their internal valuations yet again, which means the bar for an employee or executive coming in is much lower. If the bar is too high, then your options or shares or whatever you get when you join the company are always going to be out of the money. So I think we're going to see a lot of repricing of internal options in order to keep employee morale up. Because the last thing you want to be doing is working for a company that's worth 10 billion in the, in the, with your options, it's only worth the billion because when you're there for,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4022,2022-10-17 21:27:36
15677," employee morale up because the last thing you want to be doing is working for a company that's worth 10 billion in the in the right way with your options It's only worth the billion because when you're there for equity you want to make sure your equity has value So I think that's something we're going to see a lot more of what Instacart did today Duh do you see future unicorns being born in this era many people feel that sort of in the toughest of times Great stars are born out of them Do you see that this could be an era of ingenuity of innovation? Or is this going to be one of stealth and and lower growth for the timing? I absolutely think that we will have many new unicorns that are born during this period I mean one of the things that COVID you know really accelerated was the adoption of new technology And a lot of the income and players were were left behind a lot of the legacy Technology is behind the times and so it's really created an opening for innovative entrepreneurial businesses To sort of seize the day and seize the moment and and start businesses that that sort of are the path of progress the next generation of where technology is going So I actually think now is a good time to start a company I just think we won't see as many unicorns as we did in 2021 And let's even get started on Decker corn's Greg Martin We want to thank you so much co-founder of Ray maker Securities talking us through his hypothesis of where we go for the big company valuations going forward meanwhile coming up we are going to talk about the need for more diversity in the world of VC Stephanie pulmary melody co partners at next few ventures.

15678," Music Yeah. This is Blueberg Technology. I'm Caroline Hyde in New York. Let's get back to the markets. Blueberg's Ed Lado, you got the latest numbers in terms of semiconductor delivery times. Interesting. Lead times for the semiconductor industry average 26.3 weeks in the month of September. That data coming from Susqueharna financial group. 26.3 weeks down four days from the previous month. Four days doesn't sound like a lot, but this is actually the biggest month of month dropping lead times. Since the firm started recording the data, lead time being the gap between when an order for a chip is placed and when it's delivered. There are still pockets of tightness in supply, particularly in microcontrollers and in automotive specialized chips. But you see that chart. We're in very elevated levels still. This is still a market where suppliers and issue, but at least we're now heading in the right direction. At the same time, we also hear all these worrying signals, Caroline, about demand. I think of course, about AMD, whose third quarter sales estimates missed projections by a billion dollars. We reported, according to sources, that Intel is going to be laying off thousands of workers because demand for PC chips in particular has dropped off. So it's going to be really interesting. There's been so much pain in the semiconductor sector, at least in the equity market perspective. So far in 2022, this is a really key earnings period where we try and work out what that balance is, where the demand is disappearing and the supply is improving and where we net out for an industry that you and I've been glued to for good two years now. So many have been thanks for keeping us up to speed with the moves on the day and indeed some of the lead times going forward. Let's get back to some of the views that's happening in terms of valuations in the private part of the market as yet, because this talk venture capital. We want to talk about gender. We want to talk about equity within lack thereof, but some steps have been made forward. Next few ventures just announced, what is close to $200 million new funding round, it's got this largest raise to date and it's bringing on Stephanie Palmeria, a founding partner of all raise and of course, from our partner at Uncork as an equal partner. She joins me alongside, of course, the partner Melody co, both of you now at next few congratulations on the hiring, the beefing up of the team, the 200 million. Let's talk first and foremost, Melody about the 200 million and the opportunities within seed fund. Within smaller checks being put to work is now the right time when you're going to see great businesses built. We're pretty excited, you know, I think that there's not a better time to be investing early stage company at the formation stage. As always, we're very excited to partner with founders just at concept stage or founders who began a little bit of traction post launch and, you know, with the new 200 million under commitment across both of our early stage C fund as well as the first opportunity fund that we call all access. We really can partner with founders across the entire early stage, pre-seed to see spectrum. And what's so impressive is the previous 100 million investment vehicle, you know, you put your money where your mouth is in terms of talking about backing diverse founders and Stephanie, I'm sure in many ways this experience, this proof point was what attracted you to joining next few ventures. And I'm interested as to how you remain and build on that commitment having, of course, been one of the key founders over at all rates. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4024,2022-10-17 21:36:21
15679," next few ventures and I'm interested as to how you remain and build on that commitment, having of course been one of the key founders over at AllRays. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I think at the end of the day, diverse teams invest in more diverse founders and, you know, I'm really proud of the fact that our team at NextView is very representative and we can still be more representative of what we want to see in our industry. And so, you know, at the end of the day, it was really important to me to join a team that not only is diverse itself, but also values that in the founders that invest in. And I think for us diversity means many things. It means background, experience, ethnicity, race, gender, as well as geography. An interested melody on when you see a downturn, how it tends to affect women, people of color building businesses. When you go more macro, when I look at the jobstata, for example, very sadly within the numbers, you're seeing women being the first one in, well, last one in first one out. We're seeing already the participation rate being eroded. Are you worried that in some way people start backing away from the commitments they've made during 2020-2021 to back diverse leaders? Yeah, I think that, you know, during times like this, there's definitely a risk of us going backwards. You know, I think venture as an industry is fairly insulated and very in relationship driven. So during times like this, there is a challenge of this lot of investors, hopefully not, but a lot of investors might go back to their inner circles and founders that look more pro-quoting for proof and on paper. So, you know, I think that's something that we definitely want to be conscious of. And, you know, hopefully the industry at large can't really, you know, try to pay extra attention, especially during times like this, when it's easy to fall back to, you know, bad habits. Indeed. And all rays, of course, Stephanie, as something was meant to help accelerate, bring shine a light on people of color, women who are building great businesses, and help accelerate their growth, support them. At this time, how are you finding the next exciting investments? Where are you looking? You're going to be by coastal, we've got New York offices, San Francisco, but are you looking across the U.S., are you looking globally? How do you find these leaders? Yes. I'm really proud to say that we're looking across North America, and we're, you know, tapping obviously into our diverse networks that we have within the next few team, as well as, you know, more broadly speaking, you know, we look at the founders that we've backed in the past, the folks we co-invest with, and we have the flexibility to invest, you know, not just in the markets in which our offices are based, but again, like I said, all across North America. And we'll be looking for great founders because we really believe that great ideas can come from anywhere. And I think what's been really interesting is, you know, next to you has invested with this broad geographic focus since its inception. However, you know, we've certainly seen a broader trend in the market, you know, in this kind of post-COVID environment, in which companies are being built with more and more distributed teams. So it's not surprising to me that we're seeing early companies start in more and more places, and we'll continue to be an outlet for founders to tap into the major funding markets in San Francisco, New York, and Boston, where we have home offices. Melody, is there particular industries that attract you at this moment in time, and in particular areas or problems you think will become ever more evidently need to be fixed in this particular period? You know, we talk about, and next few, we focus on fixing the broken user experiences across a lot of everyday user categories and habitual moments where whether it's at work or at home where a lot of people spend time. So, you know, I think there are a lot of interesting challenges right now. You know, one example can be everybody's during a hybrid, work from home and going to offices. So there's a lot of everyday working moments that can continue to be redefined and make better. And similarly, there are lots of challenges at home using that same context. And we talked about women earlier, a lot of working parents and mothers are really struggling to juggle between hybrid work and doing things like this on screen, and then turn around having to deal with childcare. A lot of people come here and say, how many years last week of a couple of kids coming in?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4025,2022-10-17 21:40:14
15680," work and doing things like this on screen and then you know turn around having to deal with childcare. So many other videos last week of a couple of kids coming in so it's still there. It's still there. Yeah for sure. I love that you're focusing in on that and I mean the balance is always real and we're at the co-face of it in many ways. Stephanie I'm interested in what the Bay Area has to offer right now and whether you're feeling this push pull of remote work, people leaving at the moment. Do you feel that you sense that? Are people wanting to build businesses out in other places than San Francisco? Yeah I think I think the difference here is the Bay Area is still a great place to build a business but the barriers to building a great startup in terms of access to talent, access to capital that's become more and more distributed. So it's not shocking to me that we're seeing more companies built in more emerging tech markets. What I do think is true is that there's still a tremendous amount of energy here and there's still a tremendous amount of dollars both at seed but also in follow on dollars and if you think about Melanie and my job as seed investors you know we're writing that first early check into companies really founders who are getting a business off the ground and running but far in a way we're not the last check the last capital into these companies and so really I think the reality is there's a lot of capital concentrated here and again I think founders are always going to benefit from having one more note, one more access point to that capital. And Melanie you know we laugh about all the the cameos the kids coming in us being in a cold face but we're not actually because we're lucky we're able to afford childcare. We are in quote unquote privileged women leading incredible lives and I'm interested as to how you fix problems across socio-economic divides as well as people that problems that affect all areas of diversity whether you're women or people of color but also the socio-economic variety and inequality that we still see in the US. Well that's that's the big job and not just you know I think we talk about this concept we call it everyday economy so within that term we think a lot about all different types of everyday person and you know I think if with that framing in mind we're reminding ourselves every day to look for solutions not just for people like you and me but for other different types of everyday user and I think it's also important for the rest of the industry you know our entire asset class to really think about finding solutions not just for you know I call it coastal elites right yeah but you know really truly focusing on mass market problems and leveraging technology to better that. So for me to that point is there anything that really excites you at the moment in terms of what's being solved for and that you think will be a billion a ten billion dollar business that services not just the wealthy that services those that were earning less than 50,000 or more. Yeah I mean I think to Melody's point I think technology offers us the ability to build companies to provide efficiencies and economies of scale and so if we can lower the cost for you know small businesses for individuals to put more you know money and you know within their homes by being able to get paid faster by being able to make their dollars go go longer by better access to credit you know all of those types of solutions are the things that we're looking for it at next few which are really again that everyday economy you know the end of the day investing in companies that that service a very small subset of the population are not really investing in multi billion dollar companies right when we think about what makes a venture scale company it's a company that addresses very very very large populations very large global populations. Here's to more solutions for very large total addressable markets we want to thank you both so much for putting so much thought across the board in terms of investing for good and for diverse end points Melody Co.

Coming up, why Texas regulators are investigating sandbag when freed? More than that, let's bring back. In its time now for our daily crypto report, a lot going on, as always, with FTX. But sandbag went freed. It's being eyeed by Texas right now. Blue Mesh and Annie Basker is here to explain what exactly, what part of SPF's entire remit and recent doings is Texas looking at. It's a great question for right now, because it's tied to a deal. This is all revealed in the vein of their purchase of assets from foyer to digital. The Texas regulator is now saying that they shouldn't move forward. With that $1.4 billion purchase of those assets. And that's partially because of this dispute over whether these are securities or not. When you look at the yielding assets that are being under FTX's purview here, what's interesting is it's not just FTX trading. It is also sandbagged with free that they are looking at. But you also have not just a deal in play here, but also that classic question about who's overseeing the yield products that are under the purview of all of these large exchanges that are increasingly getting bigger in this game. So interesting. So the white knight hypothesis of sandbagged free is sort of being put under the spotlight to a large extent here. Yeah, and it's worth taking a look at what they had to say in response to this. They said they have an active application for license that has been pending. And they believe that they're operating fully within the bounds of what they can do in the interim. I think the other reason this is interesting is because you know that FTX has been operating in the Bahamas, separately in the US, separately in different jurisdictions around the world. And so how does Texas as a regulator fall in line with what's happening on the broader scale globally as well as with the SEC and CFTC? Okay, let's talk about the other regulators.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4027,2022-10-17 21:49:40
15682," world. And so how does Texas as a regulator fall in line with what's happening on the broader scale globally as well as with the SEC and CFTC? Okay, let's talk about the other regulators. Let's talk about the eyeing of the three hours capital. I mean, what is going on there? I understand that this is a CFTC issue at the moment. Yeah, interestingly, the SEC and CFTC are looking at whether they should have registered in the United States. So even if you're operating abroad and as we know that the location of the founders has been under dispute, they've been very hard to reach in the process of these bankruptcy filings where they need to be paying certain creditors back. You do now have the SEC and CFTC coming in and saying that or not saying that. These are people familiar with the matter of toll bloombary that they are looking at in particular whether they had violated rules by misleading investors and should have been registering in the US in the first place. So again, that global issue coming into play on how investors globally are treated without certain disclosures and regulations. So this is instead of certain products being sold here, we're looking at the very nature of how three arrows had operated in itself. Just bring us up to speed with where we are in the whole liquidation process. I mean, this is never done before. Certainly not on this scale and certainly with these new types of assets and securities. It's interesting. When you ask certain people who had interacted with three arrows, you have to ask them whether they think they'll get their money back in the first place. Because again, who is owed what and what part of the capital structure? This is not your typical debt proceeding where there has been the waterfall is not as clear as it would be. Exactly, but Taneo has been appointed as an intermediary here to work on this. But again, even they have not been able to really access the founders in the first place. So how does a bankruptcy proceeding happen globally without the founders being able to come up to the table? Yeah, well, zoom can't work for everything. Twitter, either. Twitter messages is how they've been trying to be a bridge by many a party in this. It feels quite old school. Shunan Ibasak, we thank you so much. She's always across everything when it comes to crypto and don't miss pretty much crypto every Tuesday at 1pm Eastern for even more of a deep dive. Meanwhile coming up, words of warning coming from Chinese President Xi Jinping, vowing to speed up innovation and air is vital to take knowledgey self-reliance. More on what of this all means particularly with the chip sector. Yes, you'm right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4028,2022-10-17 21:54:01
15683," MUSIC Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged his nation will prevail in its fight to develop strategically important technology. This underscoring Beijing's concern over a US campaign to separate it from cutting-edge chip capabilities. This of course is all at the 20th party conference of the current administration. Let's bring in Blue Boog's Debbie Wu for more on this, because the great gathering is upon us, the Communist Party over in China, big speeches, big push-forwarders to whether or not Xi Jinping will indeed maintain control over the next 10 years as well. But in the here and now, what are we hearing in terms of pushback against the latest moves by US to kind of access to key technologies? So, Xi said on Sunday that China will continue to innovate to reach tech-self-reliance. But the billion dollar question is whether Beijing can indeed push forward with its efforts after the new run of US export control rules. The new measures that the Washington is adopting to hit China's tech development is broad. And then we have seen that even non-US companies like Dutch Equipment Supplier, SML, has been in snared in the new round of restrictions. So, one of the broadest spend is about this, restrictions for US persons to assist with China's chip technology development. And then this is like the impact of our firm list is something that we are still trying to get at the better understanding about. In all, do you think that this is going to be a larger problem on China's economy at the moment? We know that they're, of course, being beset by COVID, lockdown still, that restraining the economy. We know that overall the real estate has been a particular area of concern. How much of a worry? And the list that they have is the limitation of US expertise and indeed technology. In the near term, probably this is not going to cause a major problem for China's economy. But in a long run, this will certainly affect Beijing's ambitions to better compete with the US and several firms, particularly emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and self-driving technologies. So, in a long run, this could pose a problem to China's efforts to drive its economy without cutting-edge technologies. It has continued to be a deteriorating situation between the US and China. Will this be speeding this up? How do you foresee relations unfolding between the two key economies in the world? So, will the latest US Expo Control measures, it is already causing some problems, some issues between the relationship between the two great powers? So, there are already reports saying that Beijing is now a storm-walling US efforts to set up agenda for the upcoming meeting between Xi Jinping and President Joe Biden next month during the G20 summit. So, what are the latest going to have more fallout from the US measures, including maybe Beijing is going to consider ramping up pressure on Taiwan, and it remains to be seen. But what we are sure of is that deteriorating relationship between Beijing and Washington is only well-made investors feel more jeery about the markets. And it's certainly been reflected in many of the chip makers stock prices at the moment. Debbie Wu, we want to thank you so much for the areas of expertise when it comes to chips, when it comes to Taiwan, when it comes to hardware as well.

15685," Music Music Music Music Music Music The great sci-fi art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common. A life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. Music For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, potential reward. But you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. A mean for launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are......a whole other level of complexity, energy, and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Vom Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there, and you go basically straight up and straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4031,2022-10-17 22:06:10
15686," 1000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up, and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that, and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H-10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital, and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space, orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, a four landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side, and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s, and somebody in their 50s, and so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant, and you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and you know, accessible for everybody so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that we wanted to have you know a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station, or to use a more consumer friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable are lighter and you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example the FAA says well we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4032,2022-10-17 22:10:43
15687," you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level, we are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you. If something goes wrong, it's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me and space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are gonna have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false, you step on something in the bathroom, you sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that, because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human right to oxygen because it's kind of all around us in free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes, who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're gonna see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's gonna be millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely on affordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orbal space. When it becomes more like buying a first class ticket to go to Europe from the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4033,2022-10-17 22:15:03
15688," It's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orbital space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launched delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right Brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA, it's that, that exploration book. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast. Or maybe make a pilgrimage to Yosemite. Oh, very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's route 395 that year after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4034,2022-10-17 22:18:57
15689," or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost hound of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's talk to him. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. We had a cab, but we got here lay last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM Land on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. Yeah. You think about California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan Svorestra. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge. Has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA. And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Haune. This phenomenon. If you want to pull that over. That is cool. We just pop that up. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots, is that you bustin' out a map, and like, looking where it might be cool to go, or is it worth a mouth, and just gettin' to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So, a lot of it's just endless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation or somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps. They proliferate. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags, and I would get really pissed off. You know, like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up. It's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not gonna stop it. We're gonna stop people from going there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4035,2022-10-17 22:23:25
15690," Realize that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette, we made yawn, hair, and and lemme some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. Here's where I'm going to get it. The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your serenity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Uh, yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got out of the smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your serenity for the smokey, um, look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across the Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4036,2022-10-17 22:28:09
15691," And where is it we're here in this near Fresno? This is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg, so we're right in the central valley of California, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles, and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw, and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor, just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating, and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing driverless sprayer, and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business, or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed, and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. And then there's like labor points. You guys just set this up where you can have somebody in a truck, and that one person can monitor, I think, like, eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup, and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard. So that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe, and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here, and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave, and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like the test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and it works on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, so you can see in the background. So every new machine, as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test. Right here, we test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. Well he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, spray and water out it and also it's just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor, and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And if you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas, where are they going? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4037,2022-10-17 22:32:20
15692," Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much did they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines they just they just thrive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine this is our first machine we call it orchard gas. Mainly designed for your your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor? No. Apparently he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93 year olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4038,2022-10-17 22:36:22
15693," To make sure that it's a robot that people want, people know how to use, and people value. Danielle Works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey, Danielle. It's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names, like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I do a great out for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her. Really? Like, or that they miss her? Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q from the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it can be really hard, and it can be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q, tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4039,2022-10-17 22:40:48
15694," She was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.A.Q. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming up all kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now, and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where it'll be like a circle of men with their zip up jacket, with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand, and I'll come in with lipstick, and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need, and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. Let me give you a look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. Hello, are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water, at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? I could see that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4040,2022-10-17 22:45:05
15695, Certainly the the print was I could see that's quite clearly What about this? I can see that L.A.Q. Play music No problem It will begin shortly by 2050 almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older and if current trends continue more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty living alone L.A.Q. Stop Today both of them are doing okay but some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation and at times I know that L.A.Q. is cheering them up in their day but I know that it's only part of the way No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines Robots should help humans do what they love Help humans interact with more humans Help humans in general Not pull humans away from humans Not take humans jobs and leave humans about purpose Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes Robots are soon going to be everywhere and it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off So don't be afraid and if you are afraid come and join us because I promise it's a friendly place If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube This might be what your home screen looks like An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children it probably looks a little more like this Kids content on YouTube is huge Views for videos can reach into the billions Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos with baby shark having more views than people on the planet YouTube has created a revolution Not an evolution in the way kids and families consume video content and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things they go with that Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable It can be boring It can also just be flat out strange,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4041,2022-10-17 22:49:11
15696," It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised, unquestionably, the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children, this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. Here's a hit of the day when you're ready to play. Everyone knows this thing. Here he comes. Here he comes. Greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go. Here I go. Fighting man. For it to go. On the land of the TV. Here. See? When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of head shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our popular IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Closed it's a mild amount of toolbox. Open it's a micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway, passenger, rapid garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say and features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. It's the fireball Batman. See you Batman. That man's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. It's 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network. There became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4042,2022-10-17 22:53:46
15697," There, there'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time was for the user generated content. Like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks to just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos. Lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Kuzanania! Oh, Charlie! I'm a tiny bit, man. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and in music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, was by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which has this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannels. Okay, and a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up we had the storm super pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child to speak unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy. You know, it was and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom wearing a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a doll's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're, they're brought these videos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4043,2022-10-17 22:58:07
15698," Camera, there was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. L-O-L Surprise! LOL Surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you've collected. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, in 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian. He's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids, and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about, what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like, what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that, why would you, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera? And everybody can go and watch it. So I typed toy unboxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it, and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate? And that's the first LOL surprise. All right. Oh, yes, we've got a goal, Paul. LOL changed the way you opened with toys. And everybody saw that. And the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL. You peel it away. You open up inside. You have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marvel. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't often figure out when Marvel are Star Wars is. And LOL eclips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards. Where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4044,2022-10-17 23:02:36
15699," Contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seedals. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop at your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death nap. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. What would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom? Both in LA federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit, Larry and Blaine, the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So, dad by himself forced us to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially, and the risks as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirls See. Good morning, Chocolatey Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL Surprise Baby Fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL Surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now. Because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter, am I promoting on Instagram, am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4045,2022-10-17 23:06:43
15700," an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry, is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents, and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video, or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, lures the lines for kids as they're sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers, and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following now, because it is such a big business, the dollars could be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, with voices, and metta universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which is criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Thank you. Now,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4046,2022-10-17 23:11:31
15701," **music plays** Airbnb is huge today. On any given night you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year. And there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb you know we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it. An apink night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from a hundred and eighty countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking you know two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company you know it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging difficult complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had you know the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of a hundred highly specialised agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Addyrbmb and you know seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They are trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4047,2022-10-17 23:15:27
15702," These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They are trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and help people who are going through what may be the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis. But they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of men are still in the same state. Yes, I wanted to be saying about this. They can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors, when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into her room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City, where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leotard counselling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odega, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4048,2022-10-17 23:20:03
15703," I know if any media were going to pick up on this story and they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York and Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report, it wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. So the Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4049,2022-10-17 23:24:09
15704," Music Forums Earth View Sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be hit quadrace for the final scent of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupelah. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object with ever built. You think about the cysteine chapel, the pyramids, the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in. It's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4050,2022-10-17 23:28:36
15705," that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrancumeral commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using it in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one 50th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components and so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're everyday doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. So whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4051,2022-10-17 23:32:53
15706," Looking out the window, whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom Space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen. It's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha, a full story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. When we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place.

It's three times as strong as concrete in compression And it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart Which is something concrete is not very good at you need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and and that's also why this thing is shaped Like an egg and if you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form It's very very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs and and that's why this is shaped the way that it is The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space You're dealing with a completely different set of Physics and environments, which is very harsh the cold, you know the low gravity The vacuum of space, you know and and finding solutions for how to Build their door or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space like you need to think about the problem Find a very elegant lightweight cost-effective Solution the next challenge is really going to places on earth literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt We have to perfect this technology on earth And then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions But before that AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational Here on earth the challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology Which we can now apply on earth to build more sustainably so rather than building with steel and concrete Which are these manufacture very energy intensive materials to go to a site Have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station on the first commercial loss from Kennedy Space Centers Historic had 39 A Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years And if we want to keep that up What do habitats need to look like and frankly they can be larger they can be small But the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to Persistently maintain human presence whether that's a few people or many people that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future We have to learn how to Benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home So we help up our cells out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else and it really At the very deepest level is about survival or species So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to Learning to live live off the planet That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like It's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialization On the next episode of Giant Leap we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on earth Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4053,2022-10-17 23:41:38
15708," that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low earth orbit can become a new industrial centre we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago you could probably go look at a house and circle back 2-3 weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established you have 2-3 days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media like everything else it touches has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents generation. Be it a car, a diamond or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018 a survey found that 89% of Millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, Millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis we have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now Millennials are getting older, they're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now having been stuck at home for over a year the same generation that embraced Ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child so you know looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, Miami area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like Circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020 New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's that's buying things selling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4054,2022-10-17 23:45:53
15709," They're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick and home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. The houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s. And that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would be showing on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies, saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. You can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. Ten years ago the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. After Andre Perry who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4055,2022-10-17 23:50:22
15710," economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out, buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership, let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills and California, most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte Mayn the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're gonna make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer upper site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. If you have any questions, go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's gonna be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram. They say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4056,2022-10-17 23:54:42
15711," This on my property and then they'll send us the lot which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that you know there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people get mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism the skill and then at the end of the fight the combatants hugged a shook hands and I just fell in love with it. It's hard of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a balletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4057,2022-10-17 23:58:43
