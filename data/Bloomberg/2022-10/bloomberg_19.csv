15712," in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken in two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye, orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in. I was walking my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, called The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the oxagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. The contracts are so one sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much strong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4058,2022-10-18 00:03:41
15713," Edith, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. Come lead it's unbelievable. It was a great buy this year for one more time Scott Smith and come lead. The CEO of strike force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when strike force was bought out by UFC my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights but five years later I'll fill stuff in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of strike force a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world there is no negotiating. These are our very strict never ending contracts and that's the case to this day. The UFC just says oh you want to fight for us you sign here if you don't want to we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. They have 70 80 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kung Lee, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me says hey Kung I know this lawyer he will help get the fairness for the fighters on you know in the marketplace and I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014 more than 6 years ago now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4059,2022-10-18 00:07:31
15714," And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that be affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case, where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct the fighters pay would soar as well? In UFC, year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that I had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to a rob the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought, fights, wallets, and then he was like, fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh, that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Rating Attours. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4060,2022-10-18 00:12:10
15715," I walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes, and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter, with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC, and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we are, every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. People tell fighters, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well no actually, we are fighting for what we believe in. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. Every nation that is a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that is in the South. Every nation that is a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that is under water exceeds the area that is above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what is there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes.

15716," $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor has been carried out. The problem is that the Southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor. But most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Bathometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jepco, launched Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. We have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since Sea Bed 2030 launched, the area marked as risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, Explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sona, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sona systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sona or Acoustics. That is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4062,2022-10-18 00:20:45
15717," From somebody with a rope, with some knots, to sonar, a kusek, that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship, and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams, so it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor, and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across, and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam, and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remote-operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water. Picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology. But it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences. We go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4063,2022-10-18 00:25:09
15718," Yeah. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer routes. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a risk that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Bade Tobi, one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken meat. Looks pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them, and planting soaring corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoanalytic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4064,2022-10-18 00:29:17
15719," I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken, and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine, but I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need, if you will, an in-game to this problem, and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So any Marcel technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of culture meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011, and essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype, if I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially with isolates chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish, but they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. We've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest in to allow the economies to scale, to drop the price.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4065,2022-10-18 00:33:48
15720," family, my colleagues. Now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest and to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So for the course of next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is just I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know the normal chickens, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space, it's this destructive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab ground meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab ground meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us and I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are and that makes me really hopeful. Impossible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, wow, remember back in the day when we used his animals to make meat. Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificialains?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4066,2022-10-18 00:38:07
15721," as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called Artificial Me, the realest, the biggest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when Impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible Foods was founded in 2011, when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been a scientist my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone called a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth, and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In possible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term. But the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real. We're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus. But they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Pat and his colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. This tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The form is the world's reliance. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like white castle, and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour, and that is Beyond Meat. Shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4067,2022-10-18 00:42:33
15722," daunting competition. Time now for the stock of the hour. And that is Beyond Meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance in a Roma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So, impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They're a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture and whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. No, just not doing sea. It's safe to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that's very, very much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4068,2022-10-18 00:46:46
15723," What are a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It sits very close to Iran actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is a contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisers into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high-visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road Initiative. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China's central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. XiPek was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4069,2022-10-18 00:50:45
15724," UP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state-owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. Its impact stands for Lochistan Province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Lochistan Province is actually populated by people who are of Beloch origin. They are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Belochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Belochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, in the 1950s. So for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense, if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward base to resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them underpass.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4070,2022-10-18 00:55:16
15725," I proposed would have cut off their C-axis and so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower of course in Guadar. It's a very small city and so one proposal has been well will just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadar based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity but they're against the development that leaves them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth 11 billion dollars. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China Pakistani economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out and we're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much a story of everything that Kevin and Will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets. We're-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4071,2022-10-18 00:59:38
15726," Game launches in history, and it instantly re-wrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most gaming was done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs, and these two guys, Marchine Winski and Michal Kaczynski decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle, so we're actually pretty bad with counting money. You can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car, you know, you can kind of think about it the same way, it was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language, but it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. The CD Projekt Greta had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and I'm making a lot of money, and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good, and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end, they nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions, and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4072,2022-10-18 01:04:05
15727," quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is... The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt, who is also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014, the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for the Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the Game Award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to the unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious, you know, one to do this with EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2, they got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you a free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality, and cared about its customers, and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that that fans see that EA and Activision, and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release, and then they showed off a trailer of the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman, and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars, lots of stuff, but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press, and anyone else who could get a score an appointment in there, they showed this 45 minute demo, and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4073,2022-10-18 01:08:13
15728," in progress version of the game, everything you see is potentially subject to change. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted out each of these NPCs. Each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to death. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1 E3 Awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market-and-driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh what?! Please look. The fear of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking. You're breathtaking! You're a breathtaking! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the Stock Cry start to go up and up and up into the right, you know, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at like the Polish Stock Market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seekings, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Bioware that was disastrous in many ways, and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, and the company would end up delaying the game three different times, and once again to December.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4074,2022-10-18 01:12:42
15729," The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch. Including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see Crunch is part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under Crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. But therefore, we are really to do this. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest emotes devastating in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today, the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was not attacked on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are, what they are like, what their operations are like, and what their dreams and fears were.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4075,2022-10-18 01:17:08
15730," And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Murg News, and I wrote a story for Business Week about Northgun hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North-Kar region and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and described tankageations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wall of goose chase in the beginning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4076,2022-10-18 01:21:05
15731," No. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning. Because, see, a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then, I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think, at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot. And from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free, actually, by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they'd go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product, to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. There are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year. And he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota, the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Kyeongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, he didn't bring the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4077,2022-10-18 01:25:37
15732," Once he was in China, during the propaganda assistance, he just couldn't take it. The Chinese was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to, and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jong would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody, just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, once they were able to freely roam in the Internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4078,2022-10-18 01:30:14
15733,"ophy잖아요 piermot Yeah Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. The shopping temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls worked best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or jc penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penny, several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4079,2022-10-18 01:34:28
15734," Problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbry had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbryer then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America, about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls? How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? MUSIC Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb and house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great Macy's, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. By experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been keyed to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. Not thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically the pandemic gave.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4080,2022-10-18 01:38:43
15735," It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I still, I wish happened more, is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there, and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today, where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump, and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal practice was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's General Counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that, and the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet, and we have an evil government, and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet, and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election, and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place, and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office, again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off for Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4081,2022-10-18 01:45:51
15736," This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the part of going in. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of pre-meditated strategy? Who knows, I mean, Sean Arts been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I have the link with. Because, you know, they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country. Went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avantue in Arts first business, Schuwenart equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Ivan Schonard was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Ivan Schonard is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Ivan Schonard and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the new semi-tie where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuwenart moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenart and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schonard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations, to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organisations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuwenart labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three years. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning the profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4082,2022-10-18 01:49:55
15737," This growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on shown order and in the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. We're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuernard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in time languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. Over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. It's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schuernard said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypocritical is loud and constant. Talking about consumerism in a critical light, wow, very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer, and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion-dollar company, while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying, you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that, to me, was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people, solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade, when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4083,2022-10-18 01:54:18
15738," business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Pataguchi. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Pataguchi label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular. Of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to leave with the fact, although they, you know, preach for the environment and want to stand for good, their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet, because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment. You're powerful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4084,2022-10-18 01:58:42
15739," Good night! Okay. You built this. So this is all. This news since the pandemic, we assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Yes. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. She graduated from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees. Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4085,2022-10-18 02:03:18
15740," At landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Google Club. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View, and at this very same time, you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, D.C. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular, sites where you have great, diverse populations. Sooner or just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent, and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley, and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I'd love to eat at Morgan Stanley. And I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey. And that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley. And obviously, it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on kind of continually learning, and I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use? And it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved. And I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience, I think, is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname, I believe, was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you're sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this, and trying to do truly...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4086,2022-10-18 02:07:35
15741," and I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth, is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risks that you're taking, stack, rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And they're narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together, and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hang calls at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020, and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it, is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent.

15742," A I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So, the main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So, would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar and everything we're doing address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So, as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, I heard about this like eighth search engine. The question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst, Mary Meekers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4088,2022-10-18 02:15:59
15743," Those earliest days, when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is, why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. What provided the most, um, responsive results most rapidly? And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception, it's just continued to innovate to make this eighth never better experience for users. And so if we can, if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell them like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. So that's the answer. Twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through Kimo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, and I got the best care. And just plow through it, I was just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4089,2022-10-18 02:20:05
15744," And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about. It is manageable, get the best care, and just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there, and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons, and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope, and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me, that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay, so even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level. If I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG. And my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside. Because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? So I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. You're telling your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. So, do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. Yes, yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4090,2022-10-18 02:25:01
15745," of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution, huge choices ahead? Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want, and how do they want to work, and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have, to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise, it doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation, appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, and are you delivering on the mission, is really important? OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google's a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for counsel wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level. And Sundar, great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Philip and Towson. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? It's fascinating. I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need where so many people are coming online, and is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you? It's been so amazing to hear about your journey. And I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things. And as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. To have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4091,2022-10-18 02:29:15
15746,"어를val.... Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000s times. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now, so no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is, I think, it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it. And thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Ford and raised in India. Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, Cloud, our hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4092,2022-10-18 02:33:46
15747," What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in. Now, over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people every day when people come to Google. They place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. When we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, that's what motivates us to make sure we privacy be it security be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. So I think those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested it became our number one priority to work harder. And so the reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying we think about content responsibility first. And then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be so always been excited about the future of. Immersive computing ambient computing AR and we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverses. I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences. Some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, you know, which is, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of Internet and, you know, the web, the Internet. All of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible, they can work from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely, permanently perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4093,2022-10-18 02:37:47
15748," from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely, permanently perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together to the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we're giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever. Forever. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace, run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we're trying to get the best of both worlds. But embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India. And a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. And but fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces. And having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face. And definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too. And having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitment...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4094,2022-10-18 02:42:05
15749," you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the tradeoffs are genuinely difficult. You know, you have to keep the economies growing. You know, it really matters. And but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress, I think it builds on the Paris agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing its moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, et cetera, over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting timeframe. You know, I'm glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging, trans which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud. Because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. Glad I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. For the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you are facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, I was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4095,2022-10-18 02:46:24
15750," just areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. So maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India or one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are always it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll you know, we'll see that. It's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And anytime you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it's it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start?

For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. It forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. We are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York, that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? OK. I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. Many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We are going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make any clues. Okay. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game's any day. I know you're a voracious reader. What's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast binge. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games, et cetera, it's phenomenal. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so... How do you do that? I ask them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? One correctly, you know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time.

I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. It kind of ebbs and flows. And so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing, but sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, in some decisions way on me. And, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think, think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine. On the second thing, I am, look at it, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for the question to be here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4098,2022-10-18 02:59:22
15753," 🎶 Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's $1 billion cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call.

15754," Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did and it's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. You know, the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, not that I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought, I'm not going to be able to understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea. And I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had start before other companies really started to take this seriously, was an enormous, frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant, all that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? That's a great question because we are currently the leader.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4100,2022-10-18 03:08:10
15755," Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader, and I mean depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents, and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing on a deep way on the product you're building, and a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency, and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it, but it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge, and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come, and I would maintain forever, is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next, and then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things? And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble aren't you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4101,2022-10-18 03:12:14
15756," MUSIC You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. What are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and we'll have that business for so long and I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful I think. Just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? He's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean really from the beginning Jeff was involved at the very very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously over time we the business grew and but this Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that will be the same going forward. So is he still available now and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Well let Jeff speak to his own priorities but certainly Jeff has been available when for example we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4102,2022-10-18 03:16:44
15757," For example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure. It's easy to get focused on the details of the business and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduce that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And those really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on. To Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. And Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. And so we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that something is not on the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation lead and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. You know, we, I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our part of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4103,2022-10-18 03:21:07

Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean there are governments, there are nation states around the world that want that information hackers and criminals want that information. Well we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information? Sure. Well we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers and not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. So a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the backend servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4104,2022-10-18 03:25:25
15759," I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now, I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other parts are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's reinvent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Jassy is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier. And then we're going to have a lot of fun for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful, basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us, while YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, its fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president, we are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology moves so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, we've invested a lot in responsibility and that's been a really big focus for us. With weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so, a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue and that has been...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4106,2022-10-18 03:34:24
15761," What's working and what's not working? Well, our main value of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue. And that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what they're talent or they're interested as whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube in the last year. And so that's just an example of how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I have a skill or I have a talent? Something I want to share with the world. And YouTube can help that be known. Can help them provide that fame. But also, we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago, during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators, in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, you can just post and become a creator. We have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with, so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. Some important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4107,2022-10-18 03:38:35
15762," A lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Like, do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, create our economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. Six feet apart. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that we'll remove. We've removed over a million videos associated with COVID. But we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that has really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4108,2022-10-18 03:42:48
15763," The decisions that you make as CEO. I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down condom that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus? And how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, they're like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then re-evaluate. Should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online. And we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw, was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using, because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know, there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens, because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic, and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are... How do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice? And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really... it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4109,2022-10-18 03:47:07
15764," like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. Even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important and have leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. Yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that and there continue to be a number of leaders that that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seen from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4110,2022-10-18 03:51:22
15765," from the government and we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. We'll just remove devoting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And but when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments and we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see there are not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. Thank you, Sven. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it. Because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environments. So if you can prioritize and say, these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, started having a left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that I think that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't at release and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add than...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4111,2022-10-18 03:55:51
15766," I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not work-wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes we be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. I just met with a number of three creators and YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one, continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me too, to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine, is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to have gotten to where I have, and I know it was due to many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please do your YouTube? Thank you so much for having me. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day.

15767," [""Holiday Music!"" plays in background� This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East. On top of stories this morning. The new UK chancellor rips up most of what was left of this trust is controversially economic programs. Scrapping tax cuts and reducing support for household energy bills in an effort to restore order to UK public finances. We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts. And when that is questioned as it has been, this government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances. The pound rises and guilt yields tumble on the news but risks some recession of mining in the UK. Overall Wall Street stocks see big gains with the S&P 500 closing up a key technical level and bank of America on the earnings front coming out with solid results. And so it was to say Credit Suisse is considering a sale of its US asset management business. Meanwhile Bloomberg learns of the Darby and Saudi Arabia are weighing whether to put money to work at the Swiss lender to take advantage of depressed values. This guy is Canadian and my cross-damer is a good man to deal with. Do you remember me? I'm Manus Kani. I remember sitting beside you. It's been at least a month and a half. It's been a month. We've managed to pack in Covid. I'm nervous. I'm on edge. I'm not entirely comfortable just yet. We'll get back to normal. But one thing is very abnormal are the moves in air effects and have a look at the point because this is Jeremy Humpt hinding the shorts out of the pond and out of the bond market. This is a splendid performance by cable. A little bit of dollar weakness coming through this morning. We're going to risk off narrative across the FX space. But this is the pine ditching the entire truss tax cutting program. Jeremy Humpt moves. Now, Nemours say you've got this bit of euphoria across UK assets, but a recession still looms. The risk is still there. This is the pine over the past two days up. As you can see, you're certainly nearly 2%. But when you look at the debt market, the biggest, second biggest drop in yield in the history of the 30-year government bond market, Blue Bay are cutting the shorts on UK debt. And though James Arthur over at Aberdeen, he still he's reduced some of his short positions on the currency, but he's still there in a short size. Of course, the market still see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4113,2022-10-18 04:04:31
15768," Even though James Arthur over at Aberdeen, he still he's reduced some of his short positions on the currency, but he's still there in a short size. Of course, the market still sees rates at 5.2 percent next year. So that is the turbulence and the volatility and the squeezing of the shorts in the UK. But have a look at the metals board. We're waiting for the Chinese data to come through. It's a little bit delayed. I'm focused on some of the data. Stockpiles in aluminium, aluminium drop by over 3 percent yesterday. The stockpiles are rising. We're nervous about the inflow of Russian aluminium copper. City have a big no-die there. It could hit 6,200 years after the next six months. And of course, then you have the natural gas for Europe, down nearly 10 percent, storage levels at 92 percent. And the European Commission talking about the temporary dynamic price limit. So a lot of forces dining on natural gas prices in Europe. Yeah, in the meantime, when it comes to stocks, the biggest move for the NASDAQ since July, the rip tire you're going to ask me why I'm going to tell you not a lot has changed on fundamentals. And Mark O'Kalline of it from JP Morgan would tend to agree with that. He comes out and says the macro risks are building. We're cutting back on the equity overweight as well as the bond underweight allocations. We're called a little bit higher here on the SEP of our money, about 1.5 percent. We have Bank of America beating on estimates. Today, you've got Netflix and Goldman Sachs. Historically, earnings have served as a remedy for ailing equities. We've lifted the index 76 percent of the time since 2013. But let's talk about the technicals. If that is what drove up the index, what exactly played out? Well, was the 200 week moving average? Should we go for our clients? The make or break moment as it bounces off this key level? Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson is also written in and he says that the technical recovery is on the way. And as a result, they can't rule out that this is going to jump all the way back up to 41.50. We're not 13 percent from where we are at the moment. We've bought them now, of course, when investors begin to contemplate the loser, monetary policy of the next six to 12 months. And then on the energy side, let's talk about that as well because I'm looking at WTI and Brent. They're fluctuating. ING saying, yes, you kind of torn between what OPEC plus is doing and what you're seeing in terms of real demand in the market. What matters more at the moment is the demand side of the equation. He says that's going to weigh a little bit more. And then he's looking at the time spreads. There's signaling tightness from the OPEC plus output cuts. And we've lost about a third of values since early June. These bearish factors didn't continue to weigh but at the moment we're higher. About half of 1 percent, Mattis. OK. Well, let's get to Jules. She's got the very latest in Asia. So the Chinese growth data is delayed but apparently we're told not to worry too much about that. What's hot for you? Jules. Yeah, I told not to worry too much but you would have thought it might have been flagged ahead of this party congress which has been of course months, if not years, in the planning. But we are seeing Asian stocks rising today. So taking that lead from the reversal you've seen in some of the global risk assets. But we are off the highs of the day in particular in Hong Kong when the Hangseeing Index had been up by about 1.7 percent in the early session. Went in on the lunch break up by about 1 percent. You can see those tech stocks. So really leading the gains in Asia. We've had BYD shares rise by as much as 6 percent. It had a surge in third quarter profit. And we're also watching the Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong. Goldman saying look they're very cheap compared to the S&P 500 index and they actually say you should sell S&P 500 calls to fund these bullish options in China. A little bit of strength coming through in the year but of course we're still on yen intervention watches at near that 150 level. Let's have a look at the Kiwi though. It is rallying the most out of all the G10 currencies today. We did have another inflation print coming through in New Zealand and that is just bolstering the likelihood that you will see another aggressive rate hike from the RBNZ. We saw New Zealand inflation stay near that 32 year high and annual inflation easing somewhat to 7.2 percent but still very, very hot there. ANZ chief economist saying the RBNZ has little choice after the data they are further behind the inflation game than previously thought according to ANZ. Manus. Cheers. Thank you very much. It's Ali and Singapore. We'll see you through the morning on the markets. Now the new UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ripped up most of what was left of Prime Minister Liz Truss' controversial economic plan in an effort to restore order to UK public finances. We are a country that funds our promises and pays.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4114,2022-10-18 04:08:59
15769," controversial economic plan in an effort to restore order to UK public finances. We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts. And when that is questioned, as it has been, this government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances. Let's get to Leanne Garen. She joins us now from London. So Leanne, run us through the numbers. What exactly did he announce? Firstly, Manus, he took an absolute wrecking ball to Liz Truss's mini budget, didn't he? And we saw such a raucous commons yesterday after that was all announced. And also, what did he announce? Well, he announced that he was not going to go through with these tax cuts. And he was going to save £32 billion from the disastrous mini budget to reassure markets. And he's also going to cut that one P income tax rate that Liz Truss had promised to bring in. And the only thing that's really standing, the test of time from that mini budget, is the cut to stamp duty and also to the rise in national insurance. And that's because it's already part way through legislation. So that really stands now. So not many survivors from the mini budget, if I'm honest, but one of the biggest reversals was on this energy cap that's in place. So we're going to see the energy cap that was at £2500 that was guaranteed for two years. However, that's now being cut until April next year. So we're only going to see it in place until April next year, which means our energy bills in this country could push up to £5,000. We've got a breaking line here on the Bloomberg from a financial time story. This is basically saying that the bank of England is going to set to further delay tightening until the guilt markets calm. The FT has learned that the bank's top officials have come to this view after judging that the guilt's market had become very stressed in recent weeks. We've seen a little bit of movement here in the cable trade about half of 1% it also is extending all the way to some of the Australian government bonds. But let me get to the quintessential question here, Leanne, on the survival of this prime minister, given the amount of turmoil we're seeing. Well, I think, oh, I don't know. She apologized yesterday, didn't we? We saw that. And I felt like that was something good. She came out and said, look, I've moved too fast, too quickly on the tax cuts and that I am sorry she was speaking to the BBC. So we've seen her come out and publicly apologise to the people, which is really what she needed to do. Because yesterday there was urgent questions in the House of Commons yesterday. And the prime minister was missing and Penny Warden who took her place, actually, and lots of people say that she could be going for her job. Really said that the prime minister was not hiding under a desk. She was detained by urgent business. But once again, this is not a good look for the optics here in the UK. And secondly, the polling numbers use of a man or soul pretty dire. If you have a look at some of them today, Labour are ahead by 36 points. That's the biggest lead since 1997, which means if we had a general election tomorrow, there would be a complete wipe out. But still, this trust appears to be surviving, but we don't know for how long. Because she really empower at the moment. And that is the question everyone's asking. The next flashpoint is PM Q's tomorrow. But will this trust a turn up? I remember yesterday when I was watching them in the Commons, the Labour leader, Kirsta Amas says, the lady is not for turning up, which was a bit of a pun. Yeah, Leon. I mean, a lot of the factor in more and more drama yet again for the UK. Leon Guerin is going to be across the story throughout the morning from London. Let's get to the US recession now, because it is effectively certain in the next 12 months, according to new Bloomberg economics modeling. It's a blow to President Biden and comes just ahead of the November midterms. It just stays after he claimed that the US economy was, quote, strong as hell. Let's get out to Bloomberg's and the current. So tie that all together for us and including our in-house analysis on the numbers. So our.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4115,2022-10-18 04:13:05
15770," But strong as hell, let's get out to Bloomberg's and the current. So tie it all together for us and including our in-house analysis on the numbers. So our own Bloomberg economists have upgraded their forecast. You see, they're now talking about a hundred percent chance of a recession in the US next year. That's up from their last forecast, which was around 65 percent. And it's above the market consensus of economists, which is around 60 odd percent. So does underscore now which direction the US economy is headed in. Of course, the critical factor will be how deep and long lasting that recession would prove to be. That's of course an open topic of debate right now. We know what the reason for it is. It's tightening financial conditions, rising inflation and of course rising interest rates. All the expectations are that the Fed still has a lot more work to do because of the US inflation story. There is of course a very important political dynamic to a two president Biden. Naturally, has been talking up the economy and talking down the chances of a recession. But of course, he's facing into both an important election cycle next month in November. And of course, and the likelihood of an election on his watch is obviously a hit for any elected politician anywhere around the world. So it's a negative story in terms of the outlook for the US economy. But I think the critical question will be, of course, how deep and how long lasting that recession will prove to be. Yeah, well, if you listen to the bank CEOs, they're not worried just yet. Are they under? End of current in Hong Kong. So another day, another credit suite story, this time Bloomberg has learned that the Swiss lender is considering the sale of its asset management business. That's crossed the Sue Kenan cheese in New York. So what's the latest here? We've got more CEO parts of the investment bank movie now, but asset sales are the core story for Credit Suisse. What's on the block? Well, what we understand from sources close to the matter is that Credit Suisse recently began a sale process for the US operation of Credit Suisse asset management. The unit, according to the sources, has a platform for investing in collateralized loan obligations. Adders expected to draw interest from private equity firms. Now the unit, so what's to say is one of two large businesses, the bank, is looking at selling no decision were told has been made and they could decide to hold it onto it. But all of this appears to be part of the big turnaround strategy. The CEO is scheduled to unveil next week as the embellished Swiss bank looks for ways to simplify and pare down after a series of multi-billion scandals and losses. They could just saw the ADRs, the traded in the US, which were big on the news, which is this is positive for the bank. Credit Suisse is down more than 50 percent year to date. The form also in the process of selling its securedized products group, again, which is drawn as I said a lot of interest. But I'm also reporting that Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia winged it to put money in the investment bank and other businesses that it may be willing to sell. There you have the ADRs, which jumped in a big way. This is according to people close to the matter. The Middle East venues may want to invest through their sovereign funds, again, to take advantage of the lower value. You're looking at the bank earnings now as the season continues. Bank of America was out with positive earnings. They see little sign of any stress on the US consumer. Let's drop into the Bloomberg because Bank of America echoing what all the other banks have said, investment banking, the big weak area, Bank of America's banking, investment banking revenue down some 46 percent as global deals were down in IPOs, also not really being launched in this very challenging season. Meanwhile, David Solomon, CEO of Goldman, will be the focus his Goldman comes out with earnings in the US Tuesday session. Solomon expected to announce the third major reorganization in just four years at the helm. Possibly undoing a lot of the signature moves he made back in 2020, he will now according to sources, merge global banking and markets, and he will actually merge the money losing retail unit, the Marcus unit that he had promoted for several years. As a big dream of his, he will now merge that with asset management, that was not liked by investors. The whole reason for this, it would seem, is the fact that the bank stocked down in a big way along with the rest of the group. These are challenging times for the banks, so that requires challenging solutions. Thank you. All right. So, thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4116,2022-10-18 04:17:30
15771," big way along with the rest of the group and these are challenging times for the banks so that requires challenging solutions. Back to you. Right. So thank you for the fantastic recap that's Bloomberg, Sukhin and their. It's got you a bit of a snapshot of what else is still to come on the show. Frankly, in Templeton's Dino Krunfel, they joined us to discuss the outer for the fixed income space in the region. He says that the defensive nature of the GCC is on full display. But our next talks resume the risk on tilt as the UK reverses more unfunded tax cuts we discuss with Emirates MVD Anita Krishner Gupta, the impact on Bloomberg. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. What are the biggest names in business? Anybody sitting on debts, high debts are going to be in trouble because of the higher interest rates. I see interest rates in America going to 9%. Because the Fed is going to have people raising rates. 9. Simply because if inflation is 8%, the Playbook says you've got to raise rates higher than inflation, which means 9%. Of course, that theory will go out the window if CPI goes down, but I don't say that happened any time soon. Mark Moby is on where he sees US interest rates potentially heading. Meanwhile, Muhammad Allarian says it's getting harder to justify the Fed's independence after four big operational errors and on top of that a lack of accountability. Mark said to Mato is improving after the UK reversed most of its fiscal policy plans. General Wall Street banks reporting saw results that sent the S&P 500 bouncing off a key make or break technical level. Let's bring in Anita Krishnau, Gupta, head of equity strategy for the CIO office at Emmer at MBD. Anita, I'll put aside Muhammad Allarian cutting up the Fed credibility for the moment, but get to Mr. Moby's input on the terminal rate. Where do you think that is given what you're looking at? So, one of the use of money minus our own in-house view is for a Fed to a 4.75%. I think as we go along, we are going to get extreme views. We have seen extreme views on the S&P 500 estimates, anything from a 2600 level to a 5,000 level. The same thing is happening now with estimates on the Fed's terminal rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4117,2022-10-18 04:21:36
15772," estimates anything from a 2600 level to a 5000 level. So I think the same thing is happening now with estimates on the Fed's terminal rate. Inflation is definitely sticky. We have seen that we've got now service inflation that's catching up and that's not unusual because post-COVID when people were not flying or going out to eat. That's what's happening and that's pretty normal. It's not way above the levels of pre-COVID so the inflation is a little bit artificial in the sense that it's just demand resuming and again all the inflation is not driven by demand. A large part of it is supply chain constraints. So the Fed going to 9% yes that is one view but not our view. Philip Elderbram was with us yesterday and he said that the Fed are going to have to crush crush interest rate sensitive side of the economy to get back to 2%. Is there anything breaking at the moment in your view? I mean we saw rally in guilds in bond yesterday but an equity has had a risk on. But fundamentally everybody is talking about things being pushed too hard and too aggressively by the Fed. Any sign anywhere of anything breaking for you. At the moment I don't think that we'd be so worried about the Fed and where rates are going because at the moment 3 to 3.25% is not unusual for interest rates. Neither is a 4.75% figure that's out of whack. What would worry us more at this point is geopolitical issues. Any kind of escalation in the world. What would worry us is oil prices going very much higher in case there is a supply issue. Of course we know that Europe is going to have a tough winter. This winter they should be okay. So the only worry is energy at the moment and of course any geopolitical escalations. We saw the Nasdaq with a huge pop to the upside. The biggest move since about July. But when you look at the SAP 500 and some of the underlying dynamics what stood out to me was a consumer staple sector that had its third biggest move of the year. It's up about 4.3%. How do you break down the US equity story given your overweight and a lot of the bearishness that we're starting to see consensus playing on Wall Street? Our estimate for the S&P 500 fair value for the end of this year was 4125 a value which you came out in July. That was an earnings growth of 10% and equity P E forward of 18 times. I think we might just get there but there are a lot of ups and downs before we do get there. If you're looking at the consumer staple sector we're looking at the healthcare sector. There are two more defensive sectors. Energy is the only one that's up for the year and healthcare and staples are defensive so the rally is not unsurprising. I'm torn. We're on a rip here with the US. We haven't even got to the UK and we're running out of time but let's roll the dice. Shala recession, hard landing, the CEOs of all the banks. Jamie Diamond, Jane Fraser, Brian Moynihan talking about robust consumer, Bloomberg, Bloomberg economic side there saying 100% probability of recession. What type of recession are you expecting? There are two recessions. One is of course the slowdown in economic growth. We see two quarters of GDP going negative but also we have what is the feeling of a recession and that's what the IMF spoke about in the report that there will be a feeling of recession next year. That's what they see with one third of the economy is going into negative growth and the big economy is the UK, US probably staying flat. Let's see how this spans out into the end of the year. This is the year where we have seen data change very fast. You've seen estimates going up, estimates going down. It's a very different year. Anita, let's see what comes out. Let's see whether Jamie Diamond and Jane Fraser and Brian Moynihan are there for Emirates and BD. Pennymore ahead on take right middle east.

15773," Music China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure. It has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem, and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. Music On the David Rubenstein Show, here appear conversations. I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Music Quick news line which came just under 20 minutes ago is from the FT and the Pined reacts. The reported line from the FT is that there would be a delay in tightening by the Bank of England which seems highly incongruous to Andrew Bailey who held the government to ransom last week, closed the door onto guild backups. The forward market is still looking for very steep heights from the Bank of England. This governor wants his credibility. He held that market last week, and I think this is a very incongruous line from what Bailey has intimated about higher heights than we saw in August. It does raise a lot of questions about the credibility of the Bank of England. If this financial time story turns out to be true yet again, a lot of a back-and-forth and a lack of clarity at the time when that is exactly what investors are unique for. I want to get to another story. This is on the Egyptian pound front. We had some news out from the finance minister of course indicating that they are close to getting a deal with the IMF, but on the currency front, the bears are betting on a 14% drop. As the IMF deal begins to get closer, you have Columbia threat needles saying that they would expect the fast pace of weakening to begin now. 19.7 against the US dollar, your forwards are all the way down at 25, and that is going to be the final nail in the coffin for that deal to be formally signed, constructed and ultimately announced as well. Let's check in on one or two other markets. We have some oil and some equities. There is the oil market up by 8.10 to 1%. There is a new line from the White House that planning more reserve releases, 10 to 15 million barrels. We will know more about export controls a little bit later in the month. And of course the EIA trims US production to 9 million barrels just from 9 and 8. But oil is up at 923 on Brent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4119,2022-10-18 04:30:18
15774," I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. It's a global economy. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week, live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and radio. The point of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East of Top Stories this morning. The new UK Chancellor rips up most of what was left of this trust as controversial economic program. Scrapping tax cuts and reducing support for household energy bills in an effort to restore order to UK public finances. We are a country that funds our promises and pays our debts. And when that is questioned as it has been, this government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances. Japan rises, guilt yield tumble on the news, but risks of a recession are mounting for the UK. Over on Wall Street, stocks and stock futures see huge gains with the S&P 500 closing above a key technical level and Bank of America coming out with some solid results. So to say Credit Suisse is considering the sale of its US asset management business. Meanwhile Bloomberg lands up at Darby and Saudi Arabia are weighing whether to put money to work in the Swiss lander to take advantage of depressed values. Let's get to Juliette Sali-Sis on intervention. Watcher could be a long, lingering time for her to go before she sees it. Jules Hayden. Indeed, Mattis, we certainly always remain on yen intervention watch. But have a look at the movement that you are seeing in risk assets. As you see, this pickup at the you mentioned in US and UK futures, also the pound and Aussie bonds are yielding on the 10-year now down almost 12 basis points. This is all in reaction to these FT lines that the Bank of England could delay quantitative tightening until we do see a little bit more calm coming through in those guilt markets. So some big moves happening in the last 20 minutes or so and certainly going to set up a very interesting session for Europe later. When it comes to the Asian session, we already had some positive momentum on the UK reversal. So we are seeing stocks rise today and particularly in Australia and Japan up by about 1.5% you mentioned there the yen. It is a little stronger against the greenback. So not too much of a, I guess, chatter about intervention particularly today, but we are on watches against very close to that 150 level. And we've also got some interesting calls about Chinese stocks in Hong Kong. Of course, the GDP data was delayed. Why wasn't that already flagged given that the party congress we knew had been in the planning for years and certainly months, but we are looking as well at Goldman saying, look, you should sell S&P 500 calls to fund some of these bullish options in China because they are seeing these Chinese stocks in Hong Kong are looking very cheap compared to the S&P 500 use of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4120,2022-10-18 04:34:52
15775," shape compared to the S&P 500 use of. Yeah, Joe, clearly some opportunities that Goldman Sachs has identified. Thanks for getting us up to speed with those. That's a truly it's solid there. I want to get to the global market sentiment and talk about a regional impact pack because it got a boost after the UK reversed more of its unfun的 tax cuts. A blooper gauge of the dollar declined for a second day while Treasury yields edged lower. Let's bring in the regional fixed income outlook for the remainder of the year with the Dino Chronful, EZCIO for Global Sukuk and MENA fixed income at Frank Conte Templeton. Dino, welcome back to the show. We go to a chart that you've shared with us in your research. GTV go for our clients. They get a sense of the performance so far this year with some of these golf indexes. What do you expect for the remainder of 2022? Well, I mean, that chart basically shows that we've really been able to cite that much of the spread widening. And so that's essentially led to a significant out performance relative to emerging markets. We're talking about roughly half the declines more or less, which is substantial. So I think in that part of it is justified in the sense that the fundamentals have been improving. We're far away from the Ukraine. We've had a number of years of very good structural reform. We've had higher oil prices. So there is some justification for the outperformance. But I would argue that a lot of that is in the price. And we would think that spreads are on the expensive or on the full side. And the risk to that widening is increasing, especially when we are staring down a potential recession in the U.S., which will put pressure on risk assets in general, spreads everywhere, not just us. Having said that because we're of a higher quality, I will say that we will continue to be defensive and we will widen less than other sectors of the market. Where's the risk? We're not worried about sovereigns. We're not worried about Saudi sovereigns unless there's a major political escalation. But is it more on corporate spreads? Is it more on high yield where the bigger risk comes to play in the first instance? I think if you're looking at a spread widening scenario, definitely high yield is the area that would be more vulnerable. Because tighter financial conditions do impact higher yielding or weaker credits more than others. And that's what the main reason why we've essentially been pushing our portfolio into much higher quality and why we've also been extending duration. How much more pain do you think there's going to be on the bond front in terms of treasury yields, in terms of the fed reaching the terminal rates, which has been one of the biggest debates of the morning, where does this kind of level out as we go through the next six months? Well, I don't know. And I don't think the market knows. I don't even think the fed knows. You're supposed to pay huge amount of money now. But exactly, but you have to make a decision. And so I feel like now with the market getting to 5% terminal rate, more or less, price 10, 4, 3, 4, 5, that seems to me to price in a very large amount of rate hikes. And we're already seeing that these rate hikes are beginning to impact growth, all the leading indicators. We're seeing shipping rates come down. There's a number of factors at point two like this being quite restrictive and having an impact. So I would be of the view that we've seen a lot of the rise in rates that we're going to see. There may be a little bit more, but I think the risks are much more balanced today. And when you take a step back and think about it, I mean, fixed income portfolios today are much better able to defend portfolios than they have in the past 10 years. We're approaching yields we haven't seen in about 20 years. These can go up, they can also go down, spreads are today also wider than they have been in the past. So you get income you haven't seen, you get the ability to defend. I think people should be increasing their allocation to fixed income. Are you buying bonds yet? I have no idea what's in my retirement fund. All I know is I'm going to be working until about 90 because the equity portion of it's annihilated. Where are you extending duration? I'm curious to know. Everybody has sort of said to us continually, everybody's in the short end, two, three, five you get paid to be there with more controllable sense of risk, but if you're extending duration where? In the long end. We'll think everything. 10 to 30 and with a higher quality sovereigns. And in many instances, because we're worried about spreads, we're also taking a outro at just in treasuries. I mean, we're trying not to take too much credit risk in the long end because we're",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4121,2022-10-18 04:39:21
15776," And with the higher quality sovereigns. And in many instances, because we're worried about spreads, we're also taking a outro at Justin Treasuries. I mean, we're trying not to take too much credit risk in the long run, because we are being defensive. So that's the main logic. But we do obviously hold a significant amount of higher quality sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns from the region. I mean, Egypt's been in the news throughout the week. They've made some progress. It appears in their discussions with the IMF. I'm seeing quite a bit of positioning around the Egyptian pound. Again, 12-month-forward trading at 25, which is another we haven't seen in a while. Are you starting to get ready to step back in and buy some Egyptian sovereign bonds? So we're avoiding the local currency and have been for the better part of maybe a year. But we have stepped into the long end. So we're buying dollar bonds in Egypt. So again, I know I was saying we're into higher quality, but there are exceptions, obviously. And in this case, Egypt, you know, the pricing out above a thousand, four, five hundred basis ones really reflects a very distressed situation. And I think the authorities have been fairly proactive since the Ukraine invasion. They have a game plan. I think they are speaking to the IMF. I think the risk reward now on Egypt is tilted to the upside. And so we find good value in the longer end of Egypt and we're taking that risk. What about the currency side of that risk? Because that's implicit really in any trade that you put on. So I mean, obviously we expect the currency to weaken. I think it's central to any IMF program. They need to have that currency be flexible. And that's one of the key things that we need to see. Will they be able to let that currency float? I mean, they've always had this almost institutional resistance to let that happen. Also, they have big plans on privatization and trying to attract FDIs into the country. Those are two big unknowns. But I think in the short term, because you've had such a negative outlook on Egypt and because the pricing reflects such distressed levels, we think that the risk makes sense. I'm not sure you're going to get the devaluation, though, that you see prices into the 12-1 forwards. There's obviously some, but I'm not so sure. It's necessarily going to be as bad as that. OK. Well, let's see what they delivered. Dino, great calls on Egypt, Dino, Crumple, their Anduration, CIO for Global Sukuk, a mean of fixing income at Franklin, Templeton, plenty more ahead on Daybreak Middle East. This is Blaineberg.

Now, I recognize we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I fixed mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. UK Prime Minister, let's try to say, sorry for what she called mistakes. That her new chancellor reversed almost all of those measures and lies in the mini budget.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4122,2022-10-18 04:43:35
15777," It reversed almost all of those measures and lies in the mini budget. Meanwhile, the Santander Executive Chair, Anna Botton, has told Bloomberg that the trust government tax cut reversal to step in the right direction and she retains high confidence in British institutions. We are a big lender in the UK. We are one of the top mortgage lenders and with a very low risk portfolio, 40 percent or to value, but clearly what is happening in the UK is affecting consumers, is affecting businesses. But I'd say the world is living through a period of, I'd say, unprecedented economic stress added by, you know, with the geopolitics and the national politics. What's really difficult at times like this for governments, but also for businesses is to get the balance right between what's urgent and important, which is fighting inflation, but at the same time, making sure we are laying the foundations for growth. And of course, fiscal policy has to be aligned with monetary policy. And I think that is the balance that was not right in the UK. That's what markets were telling us. And at the end, it's about, and I'm very pleased by the steps that have been taken. I think it's important to give stability and confidence as much as we can, not just to markets, but to consumers and businesses. You know, we are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think, you know, the steps taken are in the right direction. You talk about the global situation economically. I know you've just come from Washington. You attended those IMF World Bank meetings. Give us a sense of the perception at Bancos Santander, of where we stand globally right now, because we have a lot of inflation around the world. We have a lot of central banks raising their interest rates, slowing economy, and also a war in Europe. Well, how does that all come together, because IMF is worrying about the possibility of a recession now? Well, we're at levels of inflation. We had not seen in decades. And we're also seeing government that's being at very high levels. So again, what's important, and this has profound implications for our customers, for consumers, for businesses, for society. And so getting that inflation down is really important. And, you know, I like to say this is a disease that requires antibiotics. It's not going to be cured with vitamin C, right? And of course, you have a conflicting fiscal policies, and that's happening in many countries. And so making sure that they're not going one against the other is important. Coming from Washington, and of course, as a leader of a bank, I can say that this crisis is very different from we had in08. We have a very strong global financial sector. This is incredibly important. As we've shown during COVID, banks have been part of the solution. We have two, three times more capital. Just Santander. If you look at the last five years, we've taken a core capital from about 8 to 12 percent, and increased profitability from 9 to close to 14 percent ROT. So we're ready to support our customers as is the banking sector through what is going to be tough times. How are you preparing for those tough times? Are you taking bigger reserves against the possibility of some defaults? I mean, whether it's in the United Kingdom or back in the United States or Latin America for that matter? Well, now that you mentioned Latin America, Latin America and emerging markets, but specifically countries like Brazil and Mexico are in a much better situation than they were in the previous crisis. So typically, the current thinking is emerging market-sire risk. Actually, these countries have less debt, have followed prudent fiscal and monetary policies, and actually, they only, one of the few currencies that have strengthened against the dollar the last year are the real and the peso. There are 5 percent against the dollar and much more against the euro. So what we have done to get ready is what I just explained in terms of the numbers. In our case, we have the scale globally, but in market to be competitive. We have strengthened our balance sheet in a very significant way, and we have been very close to our consumers and customers as we have been doing COVID. Is inflation hurting your bottom line? I mean, are you, because you have increased costs, too? So look, we've had negative rates for five, six years. That is not normal. We're going back to a normalization of rates, and this is actually how the system should work. And that banks will have higher earnings. We also have some higher credit costs, but net net we should do better. Something very executive chair Anna Boat is speaking with David Weston.

15778," We should do better. We are now in the US, but we have a little bit of a rally. But still, just 1% compared to 2% or 3% globally. Granted, the rally in the US was certainly after our markets closed. So maybe we will see a little bit of that trickle through the relationship between the S&P 500 and the Tidal. This year has been quite stark, naturally because again of our relationship to Federer Reserve, and any optimism surrounding global growth or pessimism as well. So we will keep an eye today. I think it is going to be even more today than the day before. And never a dull day. What IPO have you got in your swag bag? Oh, man. So I do begin. We have... Go, spiked lines. What have you got? Well, I have data and analytics for you. Go. Fy and at from Abu Dhabi's G42. We have... It's a rather small IPO, 175 million dollars being pitched here. It's being managed by first Abu Dhabi Bank and international security. All three firms including G42 are tied to Sheikh Tahnuun. So this company is coming to the market. It's a G political and data analytics firm. So that's... That one and we have Empower, which is looking to listen November. They're thinking of 850 million darehams of dividends ahead of its IPO. You know, the dividend play, the dividend yield has been one of the major attracting factors to our listings here in the region. And finally, we have the Saudi CMA approving ReAD cables. Another IPO that we said is coming to the table last week. I mean, the Empower bills are just getting, you know, painful. They've always been painful. I don't like talking about Empower. It's the one portion of my monthly expense that I just did. That's the one that's been spent. What do you call it? What do you call it? There you go. Is that no money at the end of the month? What about speaking of money? What about the earnings that we might get throughout the morning? Well, we might not have money, but it seems that a lot of companies do. We have actually a bank of Qatar. It's earnings rose from the year before. We had 567 million real income for the last nine months. And we had Qatar Islamic Bank. They reported a pretty impressive increase again in net income in the last nine months from the year ago. I think it's just another kind of resilience in Qatar, especially ahead of the World Cup. That loan story is still also really being preferred in the country and analysts like City, for example, are forecasting loan growth for Qatar, you banks. And finally, we had the Al-Drisp petroleum in Saudi Arabia reporting 62 million reals. And it's stocks surged after its earnings beat estimates yesterday. Okay. All right. Let's see a lot to take in that in terms of another IPO on the city. Or be it a small one. But never a dull moment. And Abu Dhabi will divide for the IPO slate.

15779," who shall data at terminal speed. Call CPI in America, 40 year high. The yields are absolutely flying. Make a lease down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this influx? She are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? The downshift just keeps getting pushed down. It now looks like we're going into extra innings. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. I think America reported record net interest income of $13.8 billion in the third quarter. As it read the benefits of rising interest rates, the CEO Brian Monin told us that consumers are still spending. He's seen few signs of weakness or stress in the US economy. Are the consumers spending or they're doing things? They've got drives, the US economy is well known. So spending for the third quarter was 10% higher. It was last year's third quarter. The spending for the first couple of weeks in October is 10% higher. It was last October for the first two weeks. Now what we told people is you're seeing it slow just to hair. So it was maybe 14%, 15% early in the year, 12% and now 10%, which is frankly what people are trying to do is get the spending down a little bit, get the inflation pressures down in the drag of the interest rates. But it's still strong. And then so that's one way to think about it. The other way to think about the consumers, did that money in their accounts to spend in a month of September? Their account balances were flat or slightly over where they were in August. And that is multiples of where they were pre-pandemic and they continue to hold their own. And you can see inside a cash flow in customers, not making any reflection on this is tough on certain customers. But even with customers have lower income levels, we can send cash flowing positive still. That increases, can slow that down, other things can happen. The core thing is as of the third quarter, they continue to cash flow and it can have more money in their accounts than they did before the pandemic by multiples. And then you go to their credit quality. In a credit quality bank of America, in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment, the linkancies are much lower than they were pre-pandemic. Much lower than they were in any average five best year type period. And just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much lower than they've been. So consumers are spending. They have money, they're employing, you can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit. And that's good news for America, but it also makes a Fed's job. So Africa is trying to slow down this American consumer, which is a very resilient thing. But just to make sure I understand it, and obviously you can't promise what's going to happen next year. I'm not asking you to do that. But a lot of economists are saying the reason consumers are so strong right now is because the balance sheet was so strong coming out of the pandemic. At this point, you don't see those balance sheets really turning down as we get into next year. We don't see it yet. And so if you look back two quarters ago, when we did the earnings call people like, oh, the consumers get knocked out of the game and they're spending their counts six months later, their money's still there. So I think people are over-inticipating future. We as our projections candidate, the ballot spot and the team and our research group was the one the best in the world has the third quarter positive, the fourth quarter negative, the first quarter negative, the second quarter of 23 negative, the third quarter of 23 negative. I'll be at it like a one to one and a half percent GDP annualized growth rate, negative growth rate. So we are predicting a shallow economy. That's our core assumptions. It's an embedded in that. If you look at how we set our reserves, we have the assumption that we're going to have five and a half percent unemployment. I'm not sure it's going to happen, especially this quarter. We have it a five percent, but that's the conservators we built our balance sheet from an operating basis. But if you look at the consumers, there's not the signs that we see in our numbers or other people's numbers quite frankly. It says they're slowing down yet or they're in stress yet. And that will have to be part of what happens in order for there to be a deep recession. Because if the consumers have money and this big consumer driven economy, that's what keeps America strong. Brian, you've always taken great pride in the Bank of America Research Unit and how good they are. Let's assume their numbers are exactly right. It could be better, it could be worse, exactly right. Three down quarters, five five and a half percent unemployment. That does ok.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4125,2022-10-18 04:56:54
15780," in the Bank of America research unit and how good they are. Let's assume their numbers are exactly right. It could be better, it could be worse, exactly right, three down quarters, five, five and a half percent unemployment. What does that do for your loan loss provisions? What kind of provisions you have to make for that? Well, inherently we're always discounting the future because the way the Cecil rules work, so-called, you look out for life alone. So you build reserves and we built 400 million or so this quarter which is building that scenario which is 60% of the base case, which is the average of blue chip economists and 40% in adverse case. When you blend that together, it implies those advocates have high inflation and have high unemployment in them and you blend it together. The core, what we did at the end of the third quarter has 5% unemployment for the fourth quarter of 22 and more than like five and a half for next year, so it's very conservatively built. So your provisions will go up against that backdrop. At one point you'll start to see the other side of it emerge and that's what it sort of happened back in the panic. We put up a lot of reserves and we took them back in and once you saw that the impact of, because what the administration did and what Congress did and what the central banks did around the world, you actually mitigate the effects of the unemployment numbers. That won't happen in a standard recession. I would expect, but on the other hand, the consumers are going in much stronger shape than they did even in 2006, 2007 leading into the great financial crisis. And from earnings, I take you to monetary policy, not to Fed. No, it's a bank of England. Again, and it's from a story from the financial times that is getting the attention of global markets. They're going to delay quantitative tightening until the markets come. The guilt markets come specifically. Top officials, again, according to the FT, have come to this view after judging that the markets are very distressed in recent weeks. They're going to delay the sale of bonds and that wouldn't need a vote from the bank's monetary policy community that is the sinking madness. Yeah, and in that same FT story, they talk about a very distressed guilt market. So even though the Bank of England has paused the assistance that they give to the longer end of the market to allow the pension funds to sort themselves out, it's driving all markets. Aussie rates are declining, U.S. rates are declining. But there is a story, of course, from TS Lombard in the UK story this morning. It still talks about moron risk premium, which is in the shape of this government. Yeah, and the US equity futures called quite a bit higher here, accelerating to the upside after the biggest move for the NASDAQ since July 1.8% higher. The coverage continues from Dubai, London, and the rest of the world, this is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices have been reduced to half a million. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to do, but we're trying to do. We're trying to do that. The prices are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising, and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4126,2022-10-18 05:02:11
15781," Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Good morning, this is Bloomberg, Dave Rake, Europe, I'm Tom McKenzie, in London with Manus Cranny in Dubai. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Crisis management in the UK, Chancellor Jeremy, hunts appears to have come markets ditching Liz Truss' economic plan. Amid a report that Bank of England could delay QT, one Liz Truss admits her thoughts. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes. Fitting up at USU's point to an extended rally on Wall Street as Asian equities broadly higher after dining streets reversal and positive earnings. Plus, a sale on the cards, sources say Credit Suisse is considering divesting its US asset management business and may get interest from private equity firms. Good morning, Tom, good to have you on the early shifts of this headline from the FT, that there may be a pausing QT onto the guilt markets. Calm, those are words we haven't had for a while, Tom. But it has exploded. It's pervasive across all risk markets. Yeah, adding onto that risk on sentiment. Of course, we saw that very strong close for the Nasdaq and the S&P and we'll break that down for you in more detail. But it is, as you say, that FT reporting that the Bank of England has again delayed or is planning again to delay quantitative tightening. It did that from October the 6th to the end of this month. Now there is a further delay. We have not got the date for it, but clearly we did know that there was pressure on the Bank of England to consider this. The financial times as well saying that officials at the Bank of England, they said that they came to the decision after looking at the guilt markets and concluding that those markets remain very distressed. Yes, and I'll just take you back to one line of course from Daria Perkins here's Longbody still calls more on risk premium in the UK markets. Namurus, saying you've got a mini euphoria. There's still a damning risk of a slowdown and recession. Blue Bay had cut their shorts and Aberdeen. They're still short, but in reduced size. So there's mammoth move in 30-year paper will it injure? Tom, if the beginning of earnings season you have got Brian Moynihan. You've got all the bank big boys and girls. No, you've got rush on farmer. Let's take into the numbers sales. Actually miss 14.74. We were looking for 15 and a quarter billion Swiss francs on sales. Now on farmer sales again coming in under the estimates of 10.84. The estimate was 11.4 and the diagnostics come in Tom a little bit of head. You've got the outlook there as well, have you? Yeah, the outlook now this is the redhead. You got in there ahead of the team pushing through these redheads. That's the redhead now on those sales. And they are also saying they are confirming their outlook for 2022. Man, there's another earnings headline crossing this time from the re-insure saying that hurricane E and claims at around 1.3 billion and sees a third.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4127,2022-10-18 05:05:11
15782," Another earnings headline crossing this time from the re-insured Swiss Re estimating that hurricane E in claims at around 1.3 billion and sees a third quarter lost. That is Swiss Re again. That is a redhead across the terminal, man. OK. I wondered to what extent Roche in a post-COVID world high that plays into the Roche numbers. We can talk about that and break that down a little bit. Let's have a quick whiz across the markets with Sean Giltson. We've shown starting, but I put them for double punch. I put them back on the port as well. You got cable up there up a third of one percent. The dollar is done. We've got a massive risk on rally across equities across bonds. And so that is having a little bit of a cap on the dollar this morning. Cable flies high on this FT note that we may get a delay to QT. And European gas features dying nearly 10% yesterday were 92% full on storage. And of course, we're going into a price cap 9x up 9 tenths of 1%. Maybe that's just in response to the concern about tightening supply. Tom. Yeah, just to recap the action then on Wall Street yesterday. Again, on the back of pretty decent earnings and we are not yet close to that recession or not in a recession state side. You have the likes of Mike Wilson, even of course, the the famous bear in these markets from Morgan Stanley saying you could in fact see a 15% upside. So in terms of how things closed out, then as that closed up, up around 3.5% and the S&P added about 2.6% the futures looking to build on that. Look at that. The S&P futures gaining 1.8%. Now's that futures up 2% and the futures here in Europe pointing to gains of around 1.3% as well. So it looks like we're set up for another very solid session. Man, it's right. Let's get to our reporters from around the world. Lizzie Byrdn, of course, front and center when it comes to the action. All things UK with the latest of course on the political saga. And from one to multi-story to the next Charlie Wells is with us in the studio with the latest from Credit Suisse. And we get all the action in Asia from Juliet Sally. She's on intervention watch. She could be there a long time, but let's dig into the UK story. The UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, he's ripped up the playbook of Liz Truss and her most controversial economic plans. The effort to restore order to UK public finances. Let's get to Lizzie Byrdn. She's still in dining street. She could be there as long as Jules is waiting for intervention. So Jeremy Hunt, I mean, he's honed the shorts out of this market. Has he done enough to stabilize the economic situation? Because Bloomberg says he's still got more to do. Lizzie, good morning. Good morning, Manus. Well, he certainly did a lot in a day. And he has managed to calm market somewhat. He's plugged 32 billion pounds of the 70 billion pound hole in the public finances. By taking away some of the stimulus, the Bank of England and the Treasury are in less of a tug of war, although as you mentioned, the financial times is reporting that the BOE is still considering the delay to quantitative tightening. But on the other hand, without the sugar rush, the recession risks are heightened. And even though Hunt nuke most of Trussonomics, he's still going to have to pay what T.S. Lombard calls the more on risk premium for all that Truss managed to do in those three weeks. That means higher borrowing costs are economists reckoned to the tune of 10 billion pounds a year by 2025. So one guest on Bloomberg TV, defined Huntonomics yesterday as soon economics on steroids. And in a sense, it has to be, he has to be more fiscally disciplined to compensate. And that means spending cuts. Labour has already seized on this idea of austerity 2.2. And the appointment of Rupert Harrison to the Council of Economic Advisers is a bit of a risk. Respected as he is in markets, welcome is it is that Truss is now listening to the economic orthodoxy despite fighting it so much because he is a link back to Osborne. He was Osborne's right hand man through austerity and the unions are already threatening a winter of strikes. Lizzie Manus has absolutely obsessed with the more on risk premium line. So that's one we can meditate on for a while. And we should correct you've been bumping around between Downers Street and the Houses of Parliament. So you're in fact outside the Houses of Parliament. We can't keep up Lizzie but you can keep up with what's going on with the Prime Minister.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4128,2022-10-18 05:09:39
15783," You've been bumping around between Downers Street and the houses of Parliament. So you're in fact outside the houses of Parliament. We can't keep up Lizzie, but you can keep up with what's going on with the Prime Minister. And we ask once again, she gives this interview to the BBC and others, can this Prime Minister survive? Well, Tom, she's going to be meeting with her cabinet this morning. She'll have hoped to have reset the situation yesterday. What she says is that she is going to lead the Tories to the next election and she has made an apology. Listen to that BBC interview. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I fix the mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. But the reality is that she is hanging on by a thread. It's when, not if, according even to Minister and Ministers and Aids that I'm speaking to here, press them, though, and they can't decide who would replace her or how they would bring them in. And they seem to be waiting for the herd to turn against her and so far only five MPs have publicly called for her to go. So she seems to be clinging on for now. OK, Lizzie Birdon, now signs the House of Spirament. Thank you very much indeed. Let's switch focus now to the court, for it's particularly the banking space. Credit Suisse is considering the sale of its US asset management business. That says a strategy revamp approaches. Meanwhile, Middle East sovereign wealth funds are said to be wearing whether to put money into the Swiss London's investment bank. For more, we are joined by Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. Charlie, what are the details at this point? Right, so we are just over a week away from a big restructuring announcement of the troubled Swiss lender. So that's coming on October 27th. And in dribs and drabs, we're getting a sense of what that might look like. So there's three big developments that we're hearing, all of course from people familiar with the matter. So it's of course the potential sale of the US asset management arm. Now interestingly, that arm offers a platform that allows investors to invest in collateralized loan obligations. And the thinking here is that private equity may be interested. Of course, this is in line with the strategy that we're seeing. Some sales, of course, of some of these credits. Weas assets, including their Securitized Products Group. Now, who's interested in credits, weasew. What we're also hearing, of course, from people familiar with the matter, is that the likes of Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia are interested in putting some money into the investment bank. Now that prices are depressed, it's looking like they could do that potentially through their sovereign wealth funds. Of course, this is also very much in line with credits weasers. History of bringing in wealthy Middle East investors. And finally, what we're also hearing from people familiar with the matter is that the investment bank CEO Christian Meiser is set to leave. That is likely to be announced in that October 27th reshuffle. He's an industry veteran. It's looking like he could go to his own advisory firm. He could go to another institution. But of course, in line with what we've been seeing for the past few weeks, this is yet another exit of top talent. Yeah, the question is, do they individually consider strategically reconsider the direction of their own career, Charlie, or is one encouraged to strategically reconsider the direction of one's career? I'm familiar with the line. Charlie, while is that in London, on credit suites? Well, the risk moved continues to build up this morning and Asia, despite China's GDP figures being delayed. July is in Singapore for us. So you're on intervention watch. We've got this big boost from a QT delayed story that's pervasive across markets. Is it transferring through for you? Well, Manor said it is a very risk on session. And we certainly just got that boost in the last hour or so. As you and Yusuf were breaking that news from the FT of the potential movement from the Bank of England. And that has certainly just seen a big movement in bonds too. Have a look at the yield on Australia's 10 year down 11 basis points now. And really supporting this risk on mood that we were already seeing across Asia despite the delay of those third quarter GDP figures from China. We are seeing a lot of momentum coming through in those tech players that was boosted by what we saw on the NASDAQ overnight. And of course, BYD coming through with a very strong third quarter profit. And as you say, never far from intervention watch. But you do have a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4129,2022-10-18 05:14:06
15784," Those tech players that was boosted by what we saw on the NASDAQ overnight and of course, BYD coming through with a very strong third quarter profit. And as you say, never far from intervention watch, but you do have a strong get Yen today and Team Japan very much standing pat with the likelihood that they are going to continue on their monetary policy path. But of course, 150 is the level we are watching for. We haven't seen Dollar Yen at that level since 1990. Let's flip the board and have a look at what we are seeing on the broader China picture because we were supposed to get third quarter GDP figures today. We didn't get that. What do we read into that? Was that data that bad that they didn't want to release it during the party congress or is it insignificant when you are focusing on what is happening at the party congress? Nevertheless, we have seen some more weakness coming through in the economy. And this time in China, Dollar junk bonds, which have actually fallen to a record low. So just underscoring the concerns that we have in the property sector as well, when are we going to start to get some further support coming through in terms of tangible support for that property space? Premier Lee, though, coming through today, Tom, saying that the economy is improving, sorry, man. And of course, we are still waiting for that GDP print to come through. Jules, thank you very much. You're waiting for a lot of things, though. Julia Salis, a very patient lady in Singapore. A little bit later in the next hour, we're going to catch up with the Ross CEO, Tom Severin-Schwan, on the third quarter results of the farmer giant. That's at 730 AM. And of course, they've missed on the headline sales, 14.74 billion, Tom. The question is, of course, the COVID-19 antigen tests were a big part of their business. And they had said, look, that will fall this year, probably to about 2 billion from around 5 billion. That's one of the key questions, Tom, for that interview. Yeah, that's going to be a really interesting conversation with that drug maker, of course, coming up. Another conversation as well that we're having Jeremy Hunt, of course, seeking to reassure the markets. Arguably, he had some success yesterday. The UK's finances are sustainable, but has the new chance to actually do enough to keep this going. We will get the details later. Stay with us. This is really golf. It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1,000,000, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Tomorrow, St. Louis vent president James Bullard sits down for an exclusive interview with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes. Will he offer any hand of an ease in the coming months? Find out tomorrow on Bloomberg Television and Radio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4130,2022-10-18 05:18:15
15785," Tomorrow on Bloomberg Television and Radio. No government can control markets, but every government can give certainty about the sustainability of public finances. And that is one of the many factors that influence how markets behave. And for that reason, although the Prime Minister and I are both committed to cutting corporation tax, on Friday she listened to concerns about the mini budget and confirmed we will not proceed with the cut to corporation tax announced. You get Chancellor Jeremy Hunt there on reversing most of Prime Minister list traces and her previous Chancellor Quartersund's mini budget, Manus. Yes, but of course we still got a lot to deal with dumping trusts and quarter-times programme. And this FT line, Tom has shifted the risk narrative. Let's take the FT line to say it, Abakash Chief Portfolio Manager and co-founder of our capital. Good to have you with us this morning. So the point, look, it was lit up on the dumping of quads andomics and trusts andomics, huge reversals. Then you've got the QT stories that the Bank of England may delay QT because what they see still distress in the guilt market. Are these temporary rallies in the pond and in guilt? Are you wary of the rallies? Good morning. Good morning. I think what we're seeing now is a massive mess in the UK policy, relative to the monetary policies versus fiscal policy in the UK. What you're essentially seeing right now in the pound specifically is a reallocation back into the pound after previously when the first announcements of the budget came out. You saw dumping of sterling. So what you're seeing now is rebalancing back into the pound, looking for recovery as opposed to looking for one way dump down to parity and subparitone sterling. You're seeing a reallocation and short covering, covering their shorts. I think this will be short lived. I think we could see a balance back to 117, 118. I would definitely be interested to be on the short side again. And primarily because I think looking down the line, the UK has a very challenging path towards the one. Yeah, Bank of England was hawkish. They're hiking. Inflations on the way, their main, their main mandate right now is inflation. But now you're seeing the bank of England taking it back step in terms of QUT, simply to accommodate the government. So there is a little bit of contamination of monetary policy versus politics right now, which the bank of England does not like. They're doing this right now at the behest more or less of the government. So what we're seeing now is the situation where the market is trying to, the bank of England is trying to prop the markets or to accommodate certain pension funds. By the same time, this is not sustainable down the line. One, two, three, four months down the down line, we will see the stress in the economy. We'll see recessionary fears kick in. Any recession will definitely kick in and we'll see the market reverse back to risk aversion in the UK. That's a breathless Tom jumping. Yeah, no, sorry, it's pretty fascinating. You talk about the B.O.E. and arguably the reason for pushing back and delaying QT again is to give them that space as you say to raise rates and tackle inflation. And the governor has talked about that. So what would you need to see? What needs to come through to push that risk premium on UK assets lower? I think what we need to see is, I think one of the main issues that we have to look at now is the future of LISTRUS. If the PM stays LISTRUS, I think we could see considerable pressure on the UK as the integrity right now of the post of the PM has been threatened. We haven't seen a government fall apart so fast. I can remember. So there is definitely an issue of confidence in her seat. I think there will be challenges that seat. I think we need to see a much more prolonged program of growth in the UK to see some risk premium removed. Do you think that she stays? Dario Perkins is my favorite line of the stories of the day. It's about what they've done. Heron Quartine have done in terms of the mess that they've delivered. He calls it more on risk premium. Removal of this current prime minister and her chance that I have gone, if they are removed, does that create a flaw or does it that recession outweighs any change in political landscape manners in the Tory party? I think on the face of it, you definitely do need to see a change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4131,2022-10-18 05:22:35
15786," that recession outweighs any change in political landscape mammoths in the Tory party? I think on the face of it, you definitely do need to see a change in leadership. The damage done to the leadership right now, I think, is not recoverable by the trust. I think that will buy you one, two, three months of time to notice the ability, but down the line looking into 2020, three recession is definitely there. And the bank of England must make their appropriate policy moves to actually find inflation. So we do need to see a change in leadership. We see a regaining of credibility in the leadership, which is now absent. Sorry, I want to take your focus to US equities now. And this call from Mike Wilson, of course, of Morgan Stanley, saying, we could, in fact, be set up for a bear market rally, maybe 15%, 16%, 17%, because earnings are holding up and you don't yet have a full recession coming through for the US. But he certainly characterises this still as a bear market rally. Is that something that you would position for? We've kept our view that basically we've gone from buying a dip to selling the rally as a risk strategy. Obviously, right now we're getting to levels where basically we've, we've kept for quite a bit of risk. If we go into the fed inflation risk, we go into Ukraine, we go into energy. The market's pricing quite substantial amount of risk. And obviously if earnings don't falter, we will see somewhat of a rally. I would expect that that rally will be kept somewhere in the 10% to 12%. I wouldn't, I wouldn't discuss that to be something out of scope. But I think down the line as you approach, as you build a position into next year, I think the core view is to maintain short position heading towards the fed terminal rate. That's really the magic number here. It's going to be 4.5, 4.25%. I think that will determine the, the S&P and global markets everywhere. If the fed does see inflation continuing on a prolonged basis, as opposed to the transitory period, I think markets will read just now, as we, as we close in on the end of the year, we have two more hikes on the way. The markets will begin to price in the end of your rally, which is expected. Okay, side, Abokash, Chief Portfolio Manager and co-founder at ARC Capital Management. Thank you very much indeed. With that call number, pound, by the way, 117 is when you want to go short again on sterling is the call from side. Thank you. Coming up at Banco Santander Executive Chair, Anna Boatin weighs in on the terminal here in the UK. Why she still has confidence in beleaguered Britain? We will bring you that exclusive interview next. So, this is Brindakh. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustland, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. You gotta think about a person that was homeless at one point. It didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft. So I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4132,2022-10-18 05:26:52
15787," The world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside from and about politics power players. We are a big lender in the UK. We are one of the top mortgage lenders and with a very low risk portfolio, but clearly what is happening in the UK is affecting consumers. The world is living through a period of unprecedented economic stress with the geopolitics and the national politics. What's really difficult at times like this for governments but also for businesses is to get the balance right between what's urgent and important, which is fighting inflation, but at the same time making sure we are laying the foundations for growth. And of course fiscal policy has to be aligned with monetary policy. And I think that is the balance that was not right in the UK. That's what markets were telling us. And at the end it's about, and I'm very pleased by the steps that have been taken. I think it's important to give stability and confidence as much as we can, not just to markets but to consumers and businesses. You know, we are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps taken are in the right direction. You talk about the global situation economically. I know you just come from Washington. You attended those IMF World Bank meetings. Give us a sense of the perception at Banco Santander, of where we stand globally right now, because we have a lot of inflation around the world. We have a lot of central banks raising their interest rates, slowing economy and also a war in Europe. How does that all come together? Because IMF is worrying about the possibility of our session now. Well, we're at levels of inflation. We had not seen in decades. And we're also seeing government that's being at very high levels. So again, what's important? And this has profound implications for our customers, for consumers, for businesses, for society. And so getting that inflation down is really important. And I like to say this is a disease that requires antibiotics. It's not going to be cured with vitamin C, right? And of course you have the conflicting fiscal policies. And that's happening in many countries. And so making sure that they're not going one against the other is important. Great line, Tom. Isn't that Banco Santander executive chair and a button speaking exclusively to Bloomberg? On the term one, it's going to take more than vitamin C. Look at Sterling. 113.76. She's up this morning. But say it up, a cash wants to reshore it. It doesn't need it. 117. Yeah, more than vitamin C needed for the UK as well. Plenty more coming up, including a French energy. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Thank you. I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been in change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs, I think, want them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4133,2022-10-18 05:31:13
15788," to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing. And it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. This is really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see suppression in the U.A. and we did see suppression in the future. That is now being reversed. This is Bimberg-Dabre Giorg. I'm Manus Cranny and Dubai with Tom McKenzie in London. And these are the stories that sat your agenda. Crisis management in the UK, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, appears to have calmed markets by ditching Liz Truss' economic plan. In the report, the B.O.E. could delay Q.T. while Liz Truss admits fault. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes. Feeling upbeat, US futures points to an extended rally on Wall Street with Asian equities at Broadly Higher, after Downing Street's reversal and positive earnings. Plus, a sale on the card sources say Credit Suisse is considering divesting its US asset management business and may get interest from private equity firms. Tom. OK, that is obviously the headlines, the key stories. I think front and center again are going to be the guilt markets, Manus. On the back of this report, there was a pause, there was a delay. But guess what's happening with the B.O.E? They're delaying Q.T. as well, Manus. And that is likely to give a bid to guilt again. Yeals fell at 1.50 basis points yesterday. It's the long end of the curve that we're looking at, Manus. Absolutely, and it's the second biggest move in the guilt market on record. That's added. The fuel has been added right the way across the respect from this morning on this FT story that there may be a delay to Q.T. So this is monetary policy giving the government a little bit of breathing space. It's also added a little bit more momentum to the point. And that has rallied more so on the junking of trust dynamics and caughting dynamics. And really what you have there is, for example, blue bay, cutting their short positions on UK government debt. You're seeing yields and the short end and the US drop. This is because of this new narrative from the Bank of England, maybe delaying Q.T. It's got a global perspective for the bond markets. Crude is up a tenth of 1% on supply shortages. We understand the UAE, or Manus will make a press conference a little bit later on in the day. And gas futures, Tom, look, it's important to say why there's no huge liquidity in this market and maybe not really representative. It is done because storage facilities are 92% full and we're waiting to hear what the intervention will be from the European Commission on prices. Tom? Yeah, dynamic pricing, that dynamic price cap that Maria today was breaking down for us yesterday. And of course, as you say, expected to get a decision from EU leaders towards the end of this month on the back of that. The futures then building on the gains, very solid gains that we saw yesterday. The S&P closing up at around 2.6%. Futures pointed to further gains of 1.6%. And that's that futures ended up almost 3.5% with the gains for that tech heavy industry yesterday index, I should say. Currently futures pointing up by around 1.8%. The earnings are coming through pretty decent clips so far, at least an even Mike Wilson pointing to what he says could be a bear market route of maybe 15%. And the S&P as well, worth pointing out. It just bounced back from that 200 week moving average that key technical line. Someone looking at suggesting maybe that suggests further upside at least in the near term for the S&P until it yields. We get confirmation of a recession or a drop in these earnings. So far earnings holding up. Futures here in Europe pointed to the gains of a little over 1%. You had a decent session as well, continuing over in Asia. The MSC like Asia Pacific.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4134,2022-10-18 05:35:40
15789," session or a drop in these earnings so far earnings holding up. Futures here in Europe pointed against a little over 1% you had a decent session as well continuing over in Asia. The MSN Asia Pacific currently up 1.3% manus. Well, Swiss stocks aren't going to be in focus. We've got that rush missing on the headline number. So that's going to be one to focus on the farmers. That credit suite is also potentially on the move this morning. Another story, another day, another green bee. Considering this is what they're considering. A sale of the US asset management business. Part of the strategy to revamp the bank. Meanwhile, we've got the other story that Middle East saw from wealth funds. I said to be wearing putting their money to work in this Westland as valuations. Drompt Charlie Wells is with us. Charlie, good to have you with us. So which do you think is the bigger story to focus on? Capital injection from my part of the world or the asset sales, which is I think maybe what the market wants to hear more about. Yeah, I would go with the latter, manus. I mean, you know, what we are hearing is that credit suite is likely going to need a lot of money in order to conduct the restructuring that we're likely to hear about on October 27th and have been talking about for a long time. We've heard, of course, from people familiar with the matter on that the bank is thinking about selling some of its assets in order to help with this restructuring. We know that it's a heroized products group is under consideration. We know the likes of Apollo are looking into that. And so what we have heard very recently is that the US asset management firm could potentially be up for sale as well. That is a business unit that allows investors access to collateralized debt obligations, which could be potentially interesting to private equity clients. And so this is very much in line with that potential strategy of trying to sell off some of these assets to pay for the change. But the question is how much can they fetch for these assets? Are they going to get a good price? Charlie, what are the sovereign wealth funds potentially looking at? They're done as before. They got the cash. Right. What would be attractive to those in the Middle East? Yeah, so this is another, the other story that Manus, of course, is talking about. So it's looking like Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia are interested in putting some money into the investment banking unit of credit suite potentially other businesses. And what they seem to see here is what I was mentioning, you know, with some of those other business lines, which is a good bargain, right? So this business under, under a stress, it could potentially be a good investment for them. And Credit Suisse has a long history of using money from the part of the world where Manus is. So this, this again is very much in line with drawing on that part of the world. Okay, when a shift focus from the troubled Switzerland and Credit Suisse to the arguably healthier balance sheets of US banks. And what is happening in terms of the reporting this week, then Bank of America, the latest big lender to paint a rosier than expected picture of the US consumer. Take a listen. The credit quality in a credit quality bank of America in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment, the linkancies are much lower than they were, pre pandemic, much lower than they were in any average, five best year type period. And you're just, they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much lower than they've been. So consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed, you can see the unemployment numbers, and they have good credit. Well, let's bring Charlie back into the conversation now on the US side. Charlie's very interesting when you look at what Brian Moynihan says, consumers are spending, Jamie Diamond, consumers are in good shape. And Jane Fraser, the US economy is relatively resilient. So no cracks in the facade of the US yet. So what do we learn from BFA? Yet is the key word there, Manus. And look, we saw in Moynihan's face, he looks pretty happy there, right? Think of America had a pretty good day reporting its earnings yesterday. What was really striking was net interest income. So we saw really good returns with JP Morgan on Friday there, a record. We also saw Bank of America set a record on net interest income. So it was expected to be, I believe, 13.6 billion. They brought in 13.8 billion. So that is a good sign in a higher interest rate environment. Charlie, you talked to us about the restructuring at Goldman Sachs. What can we expect from there? Are they going to post similarly robust and strong decent earnings? And copy the BFA or what? Is it more challenging for Goldman? Yes, so Goldman's reporting later today. And there is going to be a big elephant in the room when they report, which is of course this re-structuring. It's looking like they're going to try to simplify the bank, from here on the bank rate back on your fund. So it has to be deeper. K добр stärations. Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4135,2022-10-18 05:40:28
15790," Goldman. Yes, a Goldman's reporting later today and there is going to be a big elephant in the room when they report, which is of course this re-structuring. It's looking like they're going to try to simplify the bank down as a kind of three buckets trading and investment banking, asset management and wealth and then a sort of catch-all with tech and some other operations. And you know Mike Mayout, Wells Fargo, had some interesting input here and he said that this could help, you know, Goldman finds some efficiencies, it could help transform the bank into that global bank that it's been trying to do. But when you look at some of the estimates for what earnings could be, you can understand why this is happening. So revenue expected to be down 16% fees from banking down 54%. So when you think about that, it's, you know, there's no surprise that a big re-structuring is happening or supposed to be happening. I think these numbers really just, yeah, they really just personify the crunch in IB, the flow on the trading side and the steadiness of the consumer. Is there any other takeaway? I mean, NIMS. Oh, frisky NIMS. I mean, that interesting come. It is the bulwark, isn't it? It is. And I mean, when did they start paying that consumers to consumers start looking at other products because they're not getting enough from their savings accounts? I think Vetsland and that we're already starting to hear people talk about. But look, I think the takeaway here we went into this earnings season for US banks wondering what we're going to learn about the US consumer. What did we learn? They're in pretty good shape. How long is that going to continue? That was a question you asked, Manus. I think look, when you think about things like credit card debt, consumers are still borrowing. Maybe they're spending at a slower pace. They're still paying back those loans. Really striking car repossessions that Bank of America are down more than they've been in a very long time. So at least for now, it looks like the US consumer is holding up. Charlie, let's hope that they endure with mortgages coming in at 7%. That might change the narrative. Charlie Wells and London on all things bank. Julie Sannes in Singapore, she is the first word news, Jules. Manus, all right, let's check in on the first word news now. And of course, we're looking to the UK. Liz Truss is apologised for her mistakes, but vow to remain prime minister for the national interest. It comes after the new chancellor Jeremy Hunt reversed most of her economic plan. It leaves Truss in office, but without the power to proceed with her tax cutting agenda. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I've fixed mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Schultz has ordered an extension of the country's three remaining nuclear plans until April 2023. The decision is designed to end a standoff between his two coalition partners. The Greens are ideologically opposed to nuclear power, but the business-friendly free Democrats argue Germany should use all the generation capacity available to tackle the energy crisis. Well Chinese junk dollar bonds have dropped to a record low. That's as the property crisis is showing few signs of improving. The notes are dominated by real estate firms and the average price fell below 56 cents. It has hit that level before in August before government support fueled a rally. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg QuickTech powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts. In more than 120 countries, this is Bloomberg Tom. Julia Sali in Singapore, thank you.

15791," China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change, unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our wean some sort of cyphalation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. Burning season is here with so much to discuss today. Strategy for quite spook. Bloomberg is fastest with the numbers and analysis. Of the image, beat forecast with higher sales. And fundamental even matter right now. Welcome back. Now, German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has ordered an extension in the life of the country's three remaining nuclear plants. It's a dramatic reversal of an earlier decision by the Minister Robert Harbeck as the country contains with an unprecedented energy crisis. Maria and the decision from the German Chancellor, they came to this despite the disputes within the coalition government and why many? The significance has to win over the greens or at least win the argument in the coalition. What are you in turn? I think when you listen to the German Chancellor where he said, is we need to do everything that we possibly can to get through the winter crisis. This is a very serious situation. What it does to is that it puts an end to the psychodrama going on for months now. Will they do it? Will they keep them on? Will they shut them? Would it be two out of three reactors? Now we know as a whole thing is three out of three, right? Until April 2023. But politically though, it's interesting here because there is something for everyone in the coalition. All of shots can say, I'm the chancellor. I have the authority. It is my decision. I'm doing everything that I can for Christian Linden, who I saw by the way two weeks ago. This is the best news for the FDB. He was campaigning for this openly saying we need to keep them on until 2024. And then for the Greens, I guess I can just blame that I'm on ours to say we were against it. But we've got essentially overruled. Maria, good to have you with us in the studio in London. Take it to the broader level. I've been talking about price caps from around the world. We're talking about intervention in the gas markets. And we saw big reaction in gas markets. Yes, so what can we expect from Vondelaan? It is a whole thing. And man, it's the end of another psychodrama. Today we're going to get the commission finally with this intervention that Vondelaan promised a month ago. And you're right. It is a combination of a number of things. You know, we talk about this dynamic price cap to put a limit on the volatility on a daily basis. She will also talk about the joint purchases of gas to do it as a EU27 to use the power of the single market to get a better price. Which frankly, at this point, it almost seems like a no-brainer. There will also be a discussion about the storage season. But just very briefly, when I talk to people in Brussels what they tell me is, I am now less concerned that I was in September when it seemed the market was",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4137,2022-10-18 05:48:34
15792," But just very briefly, when I talk to people in Brussels, what they tell me is, I am now less concerned that I was in September when it seemed the market was going to break, but the real headache will be the next season. That's a very, very complicated spot because you don't have the Russian gas anymore. No, and that is the risk we've got next set of sanctions in December, and then product sanctions, if they come to birth, and these are ifs in the spring at the beginning, at the end of the winter and February time. Maria, thank you very much, Maria, today, on the ground in London. Well, the French energy companies face potential disruptions today with CGT union calling for a nationwide strike to push for higher wages amidst the foreign inflation. With gas prices already jumping after Russia's dwindling deliveries to Europe, the chaos in French industry is being exacerbated by weeks-long walk-outs, crimping the oil refining and the fuel distribution across France. So, you know, it's a double-edged flash wound to the industry of France, carrying good day to you in Paris, carrying corner, talk us through what we can expect today in terms of strikes. This could actually turn into a black Tuesday in France because the refineries strikes are extending to other sectors, public transport sector, health sector, and many other sectors, for example, truck drivers transporting dangerous materials are also striking in solidarity with the truck drivers transporting fuels. In details, about one in two trains could be affected across the country, some teachers could walk out and actually go protest in the major cities across France today. And also, obviously, at a time of energy crisis, not the best time, but one in two nuclear sites from EDF could go on strike this is according to the CGT union. The temperatures are mild this week, but obviously not great at a time of energy crisis. And we expect big protests, big marches across the country early afternoon in France. I can't believe what does this mean for the reform agenda, the pension reform that the government has not even started yet. So you can imagine how difficult this is going to be for Emmanuel Macron in the next few months. And there isn't so much that the government can do, the government has already requisitioned some workers at the refineries and the strike has ended at the Exxon mobile refineries, but the situation is stuck at total energy. I tried to catch up with Emmanuel Macron yesterday at the Paris Courtshow, as you can see, on this picture. But he didn't really say anything on the strikes. He only said he was standing side by side with his compatriots. The good news for the president is that the strikes are not so popular in public opinion, but half of the French do not support today's movement, do not support today's general strike. And in fact, about 2,000 of the French think the refineries workers should not accept the pay rise offered by total energy and go back to work. OK, so maybe he has popular support with him, even as France faces up to that. As you say, Black Tuesday, potentially today, Bloomberg's Galencona, thank you in Paris for us monitoring the strife there on the ground in the French capital. Coming up, we turn our attention back to the UK as the government done enough to reassure investors that the UK's finances are sustainable. We're going to check in on the markets next.

15793," In Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. You know, we've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. You know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which only three companies can satisfy that need. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Which Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. My messages we should be focusing on delivering for the British public. We are in difficult economic times. We're in difficult international times with the war being perpetrated in Ukraine. And now is the time to focus on delivering, making sure that we are delivering on our energy package. So, before we stepped in, people were facing energy bills of up to £6,000. We've now put in place the energy price guarantee. We reverse the national insurance increase. And that's what I'm thinking about as Prime Minister. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss, defending her agenda. As her Premature comes under mounting pressure. And, Manus, we're also looking at what all this means for UK markets as we weigh up the FT reporting on the B.O.E. Absolutely. And the last draw of her defence on Friday, the news conference, was she defended her energy help for everybody. But of course, that's been sliced in half as well. That was the last vestige of Trosonomics. Let's turn our attention into those UK markets, Tom, because you got the point is on the march. I have 113. We trade at the moment. All in reaction to the new perspective the Jeremy Hunt has delivered, moving to eradicate all of that. Let's take a listen to the new chancellor. I've held extensive discussions with the Prime Minister, Cabinet colleagues, the Governor of the Bank of England, the OBR, the head of the debt management office, Treasury officials and many others. The conclusion I've drawn from those conversations is that we need to do more, more quickly, to give certainty to the markets about our fiscal plans and show through action and not just words that the United Kingdom can and always will pay our way in the world. Now, look, Tom, when we look at what Bloomberg intelligence have written here, they still say there's still a 36 billion points whole and we expect, as a high, 75 basis points of a hike in November. But of course, that all changed this morning about the narrative around where we go with tightening not necessarily on rates, but the FT story, as you said, which is QT delayed, not denied to give the government breathing room. Yeah, delayed, not denied. And the reporting from the financial times saying that officials at the BOE came to that decision after assessing that the guilt markets remain very distressed. And of course, we saw a strong bid for guilt yesterday, yields down sharply, ending the session yesterday at around 437 on the 30 year. And of course, the focus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4139,2022-10-18 05:57:25
15794," And of course we saw a strong bid for guilt yesterday, yields down sharply, ending the session yesterday at around 4.37 on the 30 year. And of course the focus will be today 8am, of course UK time when they reopen. Still a long way from that 375 level, though, at prior to that mini budget. So that's the work that needs to be done to get those yields lower. Yes, or maybe one could say to a certain extent, 30-year yields, as you see there yesterday, at 4.37. The differential between that and where we re-based before trust-enormics and quasi-quartying-enormics is of course the more on-risk premium, not my words, but those of TS Longboard, Dario Perkins, that talks about the overhang of political risk that will be pervasive on UK assets. Recession is coming. And that then throws into question, kind of the bank having really raised rates. The swaps market is saying 5.2% by May. So that's 300 basis points of rate-highest time. Can the UK, will the UK be able to burr that kind of rate-highest scenario? That's the question. And this was to take from some as well, looking at this decision by the B.O.E. I should say, as reported by the FT, that they're going to let the FT. That gives them that space to raise and Andrew Bailey over in Washington, DC, was clear that that is what he wants to do. He says that is the appropriate mechanism for getting inflation down. But the market started to reprice those hikes yesterday, man. But what are looking at earnings, of course? Well, Roch has missed on the top line number. Let me just remind you, it was a red headline. And the question for the CEO is, the guidance on those COVID-related testing kits, he said, look, that's going to Peter Wright this year. But just how much of a drop has that been? Seven Shwan joins the Bloomberg team, shorting to discuss his numbers on Bloomberg. And those who are listening to the news of the fall, you're going to be able to see it. Neutering also can come from men. And it's one of the qualities, I guess, that you found in your mentors that also pushed you up. Do we need even more nurturing post-pandemic? Is the way that we talk with employees going to change? I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the non-successful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. I mean, you really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. You know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to work. Well, I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person. I have to worry about my family. I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has to be engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens are the community, their members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee. Be an employee and be a person to the community and the family. The stakes are higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4140,2022-10-18 06:01:46
15795," is a inflation expectations which should really worry the market on Friday. That wasn't the case yesterday and technology stocks rallied as a result. The future picture then for Europe looks kind of bright. We see European futures moving higher. DAX futures up by 9.10s of 1% and the US futures picture. Importantly, given the strength of the session yesterday, also looking pretty strong. So US futures point higher. Nasdaq futures up by 1.7%. Mark, so this positivity from wherever it came from seems to be going around the world and into Asia. What do you see in the GMN? Well, it's definitely a risk on session. What's actually probably interesting is that it's not even more risk on an Asia stocks. Given how those US futures are doing as you highlighted, given how the cash session in the US did yesterday. But generally it is risk on. Note that China is the one lagged. That's probably weighing a little bit on sentiment in the region while they're not doing quite as well as US stocks in the short term. Generally as well, we're seeing dollar weaker and Asian currencies across the board are a little bit stronger. Bonds nothing too much. Yes, we're seeing yields a bit down. And there's five year yields in the US down five basis. Bonds is probably the most interesting in the day. And that's going into that risk on mood overall and the fact that the dollar is weaker. Otherwise pretty mixed session. I don't think it's yet showing up. There we go. There's the one I mentioned in European gas futures down 6% again today. And they have really, really plummeted from the peak in the last few weeks. It's a really, really notable move. However, if you look a couple of years ago, 25 years per megawatt hour used to seem really high. Two years ago, there are trading around 15. It's still at 120. So they're massively down from the peak, but do not think that the energy crisis for Europe is over. Yes, certainly not in the mid 300s anymore, but yes, elevated versus the last, well, during, during his versus history, I guess we'd say. Mark, thanks for thoughts so far. Let's get back to the UK story. The UK Prime Minister Liz Trass apologised for the chaos caused by her mini budget. But she said she plans to lead the Tories into the next election. My message is we should be focusing on delivering for the British public. We are in difficult economic times. We're in difficult international times with the war being perpetrated in Ukraine. And now is the time to focus on delivering, making sure that we are delivering on our energy package. So before we stepped in, people were facing energy bills of up to £6,000. We've now put in place the energy price guarantee. We're of a reverse, the national insurance increase. And that's what I'm thinking about as Prime Minister. Let's get analysis. We're joined by Blimpax Lizzy Bairdner, who is in Westminster for us. Lizzy, it seems that, well, Prime Minister Trass, hanging by a thread, perhaps you'd say, although five, I think of the hundreds of Tories MPs so far declaring that they want her to go publicly. But of course, the conversation turns to who could replace her. What is the expectation where you are? Well, Anna, yesterday in the House of Commons seemed to be something of an audition for the top job. You had the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Morden, sent out to bat for the Prime Minister in response to an urgent question from the opposition leader, Kier Starmer. Morden, embarrassingly, had to confirm that Truss was not, in fact, hiding under a desk. Now, she is a name that's put forward to be the next leader, but she's thought to not have enough experience across government. So another person who was out in force yesterday was the new Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, but he's already lost two leadership elections. He said yesterday he doesn't want to go for a third. So another name, of course, is Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor. He's been conspicuously absent throughout all of this. Perhaps he doesn't want to be branded a traitor as he was in the downfall of Boris Johnson. But whoever would be anointed as the new Prime Minister would face this question, the pressure, to call a general election. No Tory wants that because the Tories now are behind Labour by a record, 25-year record amount. And so what I'm hearing in Westminster is an interesting way to square this circle. Rishi Sunak could make the argument that by being Boris Johnson's Chancellor and Johnson seemingly ousted because of his conduct rather than his policy, Sunak could say that he has more of a mandate from 2019 than Liz Truss. That could be the way the Tories find themselves out of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4141,2022-10-18 06:10:45
15796," But rather than his policy, Soonak could say that he has more of a mandate from 2019 than Liz Truss. That could be the way the Tories find themselves out of this mess. Good morning, Lizzie. And you mentioned Jeremy Hunt there as one of the potential candidates to be a future prime minister, but never mind his credentials as a prime minister. Has he done enough to stabilize the economic situation? Well, Mark is pretty much obliterated Trussonomics in one day, but he still has to do more to balance the books to the tune of £38 billion, according to estimates. And that's going to mean spending cuts. Labour has already branded it austerity 2.0, and it's risky political ground, because the public services still haven't recovered from the financial crisis, let alone from the pandemic. You've got an ageing population who wants its pensions protected, £7 million people who are waiting for national health service appointments, and of course a war in Ukraine. But given that the Tories have capitulated on lots of Labour's demands, they're saying that a windfall tax is now back on the table. Most of Truss' tax cuts have been reversed. The ground to attack the Tories on has narrowed, and austerity is something that the voters can comprehend. Thinking about the optics, yesterday we found out as well that there's a new council of economic advisers, Rupert Harrison from BlackRock has been appointed to it. Welcome, as that is, given how respected he is in the market's community, he was George Osborne's right-hand man in the austerity years. So it's going to be scary political ground between now and that Halloween budget. Yeah, interesting optics there, then. Lizzie, thank you very much. Lizzie Burden joining us there from Westminster with the latest on UK politics. Mark, let's talk about these markets in three minutes then, and let's start right there. Your perspective on whether he has done enough. I mean, the markets, if you were looking for verdict from the guilt market, then we saw guilt yields dropping really aggressively yesterday as a result of the developments on Friday over the weekend, and all of these U-turns. Yeah, I think it depends on your time span here. So I think short-term he has done enough. I think the panic is now over. This doesn't change the longer-term story that was already kind of in place before the announcements for the last couple of weeks. It's just that Liz Truss and Quartang announced their plans when UK was already fragile. That fragility is still in place. We still have a country that's got a very negative economic outlook that offers deeply negative real yields, that has a current account deficit, is suffering from the global energy crisis that's focused on the continent. So the negative story for the UK remains firmly in place, and will be there in 2023. It's just that everyone knows it. That pessimism is price. We're back to this world where it's a very negative story, but it's priced. I actually think that the next couple of months could see a little bit of relief, rally, I think that could be more broadly in markets, and more pound negativity, maybe a story for 2023. Yeah, it does seem as if with the removal of the very near-term concerns around the UK, the tensions and the risk of environment that that had created, that other risk assets have been allowed to fly. And we do see quite a lot of risk appetite right now, Mike. Mark, would you put that down to last night in the US session, and today into the Asia session, and then into the next US session as well? US features pointing markedly higher without any real change in fundamentals. Yeah, I think it's what's the next catalyst? So people are looking around saying, OK, we know the feds now are going to hike aggressively again at the next meeting. We've got that story. Inflation might have peaked at my commas. So that's one risk that again is priced. When it comes to US earnings, I think US earnings will beat lowered expectations. The US economy is still very strong, still holding on very well. Remember, my underlying longer-term bearish picture is the whole fact that US rates will be hiked more than most people think, because the US economy is stronger than people think. And therefore, US recession is more mid-2023 story. And that's when earnings will start to start to bite next year. So I think earnings will beat that'll provide a little bit of a boost. We've got the bearishness priced in across the world. We know the negative stories. So where is the negative catalyst going to come from here? Probably not something soon until something breaks. That will require rates to hike a little bit more aggressive than priced. So I think for now, we can get a relief rally. I think this could last for another month or so. Could last into year end. It's hard to put it the exact timing. But generally, I think we're in a tactical bear market, but it is a bear market. OK. A tactical bear market bounce. So not necessarily with any longevity. And that leaves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4142,2022-10-18 06:15:05
15797," back timing, but generally I think we're in a tactical bear market, but it is a bear market. Okay. A tactical bear market bounce, so not necessarily with any longevity. That leaves stocks then vulnerable if something breaks. What do you think might break? What might break that stops the fed from hiking quite so aggressively, Mark? So I think something will definitely have to break at one point. I'm trying to work out what the thing is we're not looking at. And I'm wondering whether it might be private debt markets, via private equity, that might be a next-year story that would feed into the US pension system, where about 20% of their assets are now in private equity from being non-existent before. Okay, well, that's certainly pick up on that conversation shortly. Remember, you can get up to date analysis and insight with Mark and the rest of the market's live team. NLIVGo is the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal. Coming up on this program, another day, another development in Credit Suisse's strategy, revamp saga. We've got the details of the sale of its US asset management arm. Plus, we're keeping it Swiss, Roche sales drop as demand for COVID-19 tests and equipment debates. We'll be speaking to the CEO of the farmer giant at 7.30 a.m. London time. Up next, though, the FTE reports the Bank of England is likely to delay its quantitative tightening plans. Until the guilt market calms down. We discussed that and other developments in guilt markets in global fixed income with Scott Teal, BlackRock, Chief Fixed Income Strategist, who joins us shortly. If you have any of your own questions, please get in touch. IB Plus TV Go is the function to use to talk to us here at Bloomberg TV. This is Bloomberg. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it and building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. We are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps taken are in the right direction. Now with Santander's Annabotine speaking exclusively to Bloomberg, David Weston on Britain's reversal of its controversial tax cutting plans. Joining us now to think about guilt markets, how they've responded to those news developments and also the actions of the bank of England, Scott Seal, Black Rock, Chief Fixing Come Strategist joins us here on set in London. Scott, very nice to have you with us. We'll talk more globally, but we'll sort of jump off the UK story as it has been so pivotal, I suppose, even for global markets. So the guilt market operates then at the long end without the bank of England involved buying at the long end. How would you assess day one of that and post all the weekend?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4143,2022-10-18 06:18:41
15798," It goes even for global markets. So the guilt market operates then at the long end without the Bank of England involved buying at the long end. How would you assess day one of that and post all of weekend's political developments does the guilt market seem to be standing on its own two feet? Well, obviously we've had a big, big rally in long end gilts, right? Rejecting come to the high levels that we saw right around the government's announcement. And it's both in nominal gilts and in real rates as well. So it's been a very kind of parallel move in real and nominal rates. And market is telling you that it's very important that the government reversed its plan, right? This is not so much about the Bank of England's end of the bond purchasing is more about the positive, at least from a market perspective, positive developments from the UK government, which is really an interesting development, right? In each one of these situations, we learn something, it's gonna be an incredible case study of how the markets effectively significantly rejected the government's plan. And in some respects, now are accepting the reversal, if you will, by rallying and by being much more stable. Okay, Mark, jump in. Scott, some of the underlying problems here haven't gone away. So what breaks, is it the currency or as a gilts again in 2023? I mean, the backdrop story is, we still got a very large current account deficit. We still got deeply negative real yields in a rising rates world. Those things don't normally go together. So is it the currency market that continues to weaken or do we see another big sell off in gilts next year? Well, I mean, it's interesting. I think that we have to take the fact that we may see more austere government going forward, less spending, more concerned about fiscal prudence, and that's gonna be positive on balance for gilts and for the currency in some respects. I do think we still need to see some continued correction. Right, we've been through a very shocking event for the UK, right, in terms of the government's announcements and the reversal of the Bank of England's purchase program. And now the end of it. So I think we need some time to kind of settle into a more kind of equilibrium. But what I would say is, we had been negative gilts because of the concerns around the government's program. We've moved back to neutral because those concerns are gone in the respect that the government has reversed its plan. And now actually we're reflecting on what the more fiscal austere process means for UK government bonds in particular because you could build to some degree a positive story coming out of that, right? And tell us what it means to you then, Scott, that bond vigilantes seem to be back here. Because for many years, they weren't very evident when we lived through that low rates environment for such a long time. And they didn't seem to be to the fore and people told stories of the 80s and what that was like to trade through. So tell us what it means to you that they seem to be back, seem to be asserting themselves once again. Yeah, I mean, I think again, this is a case study in lessons learned, right? In the lessons we learned is that politics drive markets, but then market drive politics, right? And so I think it's really important that bond vigilantes came back and said, look, we're not accepting this, right? This is not the way that the markets are gonna go forward with this type of spending package, with this type of additional spending. And so the lessons we've learned is that the markets really can exact, you know, they're kind of the pound of flesh, if you will. And I think the interesting part of that is in a period of the last few years, right, where we had what we call the great moderation in the last two decades, right? Well, rates are very low. Economic volatility was very low. Right, bond vigilantes struggled in that environment because of the pervasive kind of quantitative easing and low rates, right? We're in a totally different environment now. And so, you know, it's a, the volatility is much greater and bond vigilantes are back like the big 80s, I guess. Okay, it's got, say with us, we'll certainly pick up on this conversation, have a broader one around the globe. Scott Teal joining us there from BlackRock, chief fixed income strategist, he'll be with us a little longer on the program. Coming up, could a Treasury buyback scheme be moving closer to reality? It's been bubbling for a few months and is now firmly in the spotlight, it seems. We'll see what's got fixed. This is BlackRock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4144,2022-10-18 06:23:58
15799," second COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been in change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is a whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing. And it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have to do the great questions. It's a great question. Great question. And the best question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Everybody's sitting on debts, high debts are going to be in trouble because of the higher interest rates. I see interest rates in America going to 9% because the Fed is going to have to be one raising rates. Nine. Simply because if inflation is 8%, the playbook says you've got to raise rates higher than inflation, which means 9%. Of course, that theory will go out the window if CPI goes down, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. Mark Moby is there saying US interest rates could hit 9%. Let's take a look at what's happening on Treasury market. Scotts yield still with us from Black Rocks. Scotts, let's deal with that point. I assume you don't share the view that we go to 9%. So where do you think we go to? And crucially, when, because you were selling me in the break about the correlation between stocks and bonds and how important it is, therefore, to know where and when we get to. I think that's right. We see the peak in Fed funds at around 5%. So more or less market pricing, market pricing a little bit lower at the moment. But I do think the correlation between stocks and bonds has been so incredibly high. Decade level highs over the last couple of months. Obviously, the rate view is going to be driving risk assets. One of the things that's very interesting is on the CPI number, for example, we had the upside missed to some degree, we were unable to push time that Fed funds through 5% significantly. And so I think to some degree, just talking about kind of very near-term market conditions, there is at least the equity market say, okay, well, we're not going above 5% at least for right now. And we have some clarity around that or at least the view is that there's some clarity around that. So knowing kind of where the peak is going to be is maybe part of the reason why equity markets have done better the last couple of days. Okay, okay, Mark. Scot, I buy into that theory kind of in the short term for the kind of year end trade, this idea that, hey, we've got some certainly around the terminal rate and that supports the market and that's why we might get a bit of relief rally. My concern is that, you know, a year from now, we still got CPI figures that are around 5%, let's say, not below 4%. And then everyone's going to go as way to sec. That's just a floor. And therefore, the inflation cycles pick back up again unless rates are tightened. And so therefore next year, I think the terminal rate will be challenged on the top side again, probably as soon as the first or second quarter. What's your pushbacking on that idea? Yeah, no, I think that clearly as we go through the rest of the year, the central banks are dealing with effectively the trade off between inflation and growth, right? And they are reacting to inflation. So the Fed is yet to really kind of fully admit that there will be a recession in the U.S. in the upcoming years. And so they're focused on fighting the inflation number. And obviously the upside risk is that inflation continues to push higher and monetary policy continues to push higher with it. We haven't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4145,2022-10-18 06:28:09
15800," coming years. And so they're focused on fighting the inflation number. And obviously the upside risk is that inflation continues to push higher and monetary policy continues to push higher with it. So our view really on on equities is still negative because we see that fed reacting to the inflation and not to the growth issue. But we also see, you know, earnings we think will be lower than estimates as we come into the final quarter. And so on balance that leaves us negative equities. But I think obviously the risk is that the central banks and the Fed continue to fight inflation and not recognize that trade off with inflation and growth. Okay. Thinking about what is driving treasuries, it just seems to be an interesting talking point at the moment. We'll see if it gets any further than a talking point, Scott. And that is around whether the government should start buying back treasuries. I was reading a piece talking about buying back 20 years as the central banks are selling their holdings trying to reduce the size of their balance sheets. And the Fed is looking to do that. Where does that story go for you, that narrative? Well, I mean, I think it's an obviously the QE unwind QT program is very much part of the monetary policy framework that we're going forward. And so I think in many respects, you know, it is all part of fighting the inflation environment that we're in. And so I mean, I understand there might be a shift between parts of the government on government debt, but on balance, you know, we would expect the QT program to come into play and monetary policy to continue increasing rate. So I don't think, you know, I think it's about the yield curve view is about kind of recession and upcoming recession potential. I don't think it's necessarily about the buy back. Scott, I want to ask you very quickly a question that's sent in by a viewer here. Do you think of allocation as a global problem, mainly driven by the PQS rate level and timing? Or do you think about it on a region by region basis, EG China doing its own thing, US driven by rates, Europe doomed? Well, yes. So I think obviously the the capital market is all very connected and it's very important. And we specifically, you know, a year or two ago broke China out separately as its own investment region because obviously the size, the independence of the central bank and the independent and a factors within China as an investment area. But I do think all of these things are very important. Obviously, because of the pervasiveness of US Treasury is in the size of the market. What the Fed policy does in many respects has a very important impact across fixed income markets in Europe and obviously in emerging markets through the dollar. So, you know, we think about it cohesively, but we also recognize that each region has its own specific idiosyncratic. Okay. Great to see you, Scott. Thank you very much.

For instance, an app store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push-in-to-ads is a little ironic given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible from advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

Interesting conversation with the last guest Scott Teal from BlackRock he was talking about how if risk assets can have a sense of any kind of certainty around just how high rates will go in the United States and maybe they thought they saw that they saw evidence of that around that CPI print then maybe that is a positive just knowing where rates might top out.

Now Mark you've been away for a little bit some stuff's been happening here in the UK and I know that you've been giving it some thoughts whilst you've been away what did you conclude? Yeah I'm a little bit sad I missed it all the drama but I'm glad you restored cam from me to return and I think this is one of the issues we talked about today that you know Jeremy Hunt in his speech yesterday has restored a bit of credibility to the UK so we were trading credibility in the last couple of weeks we've now moved beyond that and the beyond that is the fact is the UK fundamentals remain deeply negative I guess we've got this trifect of this idea that deeply negative current account deficit or you know current account deficit that's growing in an energy crisis deeply negative real yields well how do you fund that you either fund it through offering more attractive yields or your currency must weaken so I think next year the plan is going to be vulnerable so I wanted to look at this through a few ways so first of all this chart shows the benchmark policy rate in the UK minus the most recent headline inflation print then this goes back over the last 30 years and you can see well minus 8.2 percent it really is quite extreme and just something we've never seen before so and you know this is why we're kind of weighing on the pound this is the general story at the moment now this needs to go a lot higher if you look at the 30-year average it's about 1 percent if you look at the pre GFC average which I would say is what we're kind of going back into it's more like 3 percent so I'm saying what you rates have to go up to be positive 3 percent i.e. 11 percent raised no remember this can move up either through inflation falling or through benchmark rates go up or a combination of both which is what we're seeing so how do we look at this in a forward basis so I want to go to the next chart so there's different ways you can look at this but one way I like looking at is what is the full-year inflation forecast for the UK for next year well it's currently about 6.2 percent so what do we look at where two year yields of price which kind of gives you an average kind of 10 year for next year versus the average CPI",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4147,2022-10-18 06:36:17
15802," It's the full year inflation forecast for the UK for next year. Well, it's currently about 6.2%. So what do we look at where two year yields are priced, which kind of gives you an average kind of 10 year for next year versus the average CPI for next year, to kind of give us a little bit of a measure. So this is a chart of two year UK yields minus the full year inflation forecast for 2023. And it's only at minus 2.6%, which looks a little bit less drastic. And obviously, we're way off the lows from September. And this is when the pound was really, really slumping when we got this kind of story. So now we're getting back into more real world. Now I couldn't do a longer history here because the consensus forecast for next year's inflation weren't really valid before that. But if we go back to the previous model, we're longer term, we probably need to get this in positive territory. They're suggest that either inflation forecasting to drop a much further from where they are now, maybe with a very, very deep recession, or we need to get much higher yields priced. And I think that's what we're going to get. I think we're going to get higher yields in the UK than are priced over the next 12 months. And I think we're probably going to get a deeper recession. And therefore, inflation might come off a little bit more as well. As our past guest, Scott Teal, is just saying, we might get a little bit more austerity in the UK, which might be slower growth, which means lower inflation. But ultimately, these needs to move a lot higher. And until that does, the pound fundamentally will remain under pressure. Maybe it's going to get relief for the next month or two. But in 2023, the pound will remain very weak until this gets fixed. OK, really interesting. So those are the underlying drivers of UK assets right now. The fear about recession and austerity points, well, made mark. I'm glad we moved on from the initial impression created by the first job. Perhaps we needed 10% or so more in interest rate hikes. So that was a relief. Let's move on to some corporate news this morning. Analysts were expecting a strong quarter for Roach, but sales fell 6% with lower demand for COVID tests and medication. Shares have dropped around 13% this year in Zurich, more than double the fall of a Bloomberg index of farmer companies. Joining us now is Severin Schwan, the CEO of Roach. Severin, really nice to see you as ever on the program. There were some analysts talking about how we might get a guidance upgrade this time around. Not everybody, but some were talking in those terms. We haven't got that. You've confirmed your outlook, though. And some of the sales on the farmer side coming in below estimates. Do you think the market might be a bit disappointed with what you've reported today? Overall, I'm very happy with the results. What we have seen is on the one hand a sharp decline in COVID-related sales, both in our farmer business as well as for diagnostics business. But if you look at the underlying business, excluding the COVID-related sales, we have seen a strong robust growth with our newer medicines and diagnostic solutions. And on that basis, we could also confirm the outlook for the full year. Good morning, Severin. So you talked there about the really sharp decline in COVID-related sales. Do you expect that to continue dropping at the same pace in the fourth quarter? Or it could even accelerate? And as a result, do you stick by your estimates for the losses for that sector or do you think they could be even bigger now? It's always a bit difficult to predict what this virus is doing, but in our base plans, indeed, we expect that the demand for COVID-related products like tests and medicines will remain on the lower level, also for the fourth quarter. But in spite of that, we expect to grow for the full year. And we confirm our outlook. But yes, indeed, we believe that COVID-related sales will be lower for the remainder of this year. And can I ask you about a key focus for investors, Severin, which is, of course, the Alzheimer's drug that you've been working on? I think the results of the Phase III trial are due at the end of November. What are you hoping for? What will be a good result? To be very clear, we do not yet have the results in house. So we really have to wait for the readout of these Phase III pivotal trials. We expect to communicate the results by end of November, and then we'll take it from there. It is encouraging to see that one of our competitors recently reported positive results with the Alzheimer study. But I'm not able to comment yet on our results, not because I don't want to. It's simply because I don't know yet. So let's keep fingers crossed, and then we will communicate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4148,2022-10-18 06:40:55
15803," But I'm not able to comment yet on our results, not because I don't want to, it's simply because I don't know yet. So let's keep fingers crossed and then we will communicate the results end of November. Severn, I understand you don't have any in-house kind of idea of where the results come through yet and therefore you can't provide any guidance where the results will come through. But I'm interested, are you looking at the results through a different lens in the wake of BioGen's success? Does that kind of change the metrics of how you're going to evaluate or is it the exact same story? You know, at the end of the day, we have to wait for the results of our clinical trials for our medicine, but it is certainly encouraging that we have now seen the first result with a medicine or in that class to have an effect on Alzheimer's and no matter what. I mean, this is good news for patients. So let's keep fingers crossed that we'll see positive results for our molecule as well. But we have to wait for the readout. Yes, we'll wait for the readout, Severn. But there is a lot of excitement of course around this particular area of science right now. How far away could we be from treatment that is commercially available and successful and that is widely available because away from financial markets, that's what a lot of people will be interested in. Sure, and that's what I'm interested in personally as well. And we are all eagerly awaiting the results of the clinical trials for Gantanero Mab, our lead molecule in this space. So let's keep fingers crossed that we have a positive readout. If this is the case, then we will of course do everything to bring such a medicine to patients as fast as possible. Severn, how concerned are you by the macro environment? You haven't changed your guidance. Is that directly related to the fact that, you know, the losses in the pharmaceutical sector and the COVID sector? Or is it because the macro environment is keeping you pretty conservative? I mean, as note out that the current geopolitical tensions, inflation, et cetera, heavily based on economies all over the world. But what we have seen in the past is that our sector, the life science industry, is less exposed to economic cycles. So they demand for life saving medicines for severe diseases, like cancer typically is less influenced by economic cycles. What I should say, however, would really count in the mid and longer term is your ability to innovate, to come up with better medicines. And if I look at the Rochport folio, we have a new record high of molecular entities, potential new medicines in our clinical portfolio, 85 new molecular entities, and that should provide us with growth, notably for now, but also in the mid and in the long term. Severn, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us. Good to speak to you. Severn, Shwan, the CEO of Roch. Let us get a broom-boke business flash. Alice Atkins has an update for us. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Anna. Credit sweeps us considering a sale of its US asset management business, that's as the firm nears a strategy revamp that's likely to reach a business and top ranks. According to sources familiar with the matters, the Swiss bank recently began the process to sell the US operations. We're told the division is likely to attract interest from private equity firms. No comment from Credit Suisse. Bank for American shares jumped yesterday after the bank reported third quarter results with trading revenues holding strong. The bank also delivered strong net interest income with an increase of roughly 24%. CEO Brian Monahan says the consumer is remaining strong. Their credit quality and a credit quality of bank America in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment, the linkancies are much low and they work pretty pandemic. Much lower than they were in any average, five best year type period. And just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much low in the bend. So consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed, you can see the unemployment numbers, and they have good credit. Britain's reversal of its controversial tax cutting plans are a step in the right direction. That's according to Anna Boatin, the chair of one of the UK's biggest lenders, Santander.

15804," Its controversial tax cutting plans are a step in the right direction. That's according to Anna Boatin, the chair of one of the UK's biggest lenders, Santander. She says it's important to give stability and confidence, not just to markets, but to consumers and businesses. We are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps are taken in the right direction. That's your Bloomberg Business Flash, Anna. Very much, Alice Allen, Salisakins here in London. Coming up on the programme, third quarter, earnings season four, Wall Street banks draws through her clothes. We Goldman Sachs sets a report later today. We heard a little excerpt from what Bank of America had to say. We will look back on what we've learned so far and look ahead to Goldman later this. It's been back. China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem, and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Welcome back to Boombay Market's Europe at 744 in London, 16 minutes until the start of cash equity trading for this morning. The future picture looks brighter up by more than 1% than that. US futures rallying a pace and that's that futures up by more than 2% right now. Let's focus on the earnings story, because perhaps this is where some of the positivity is coming from. US banks are reporting this week, Bank of America, is the latest big lender to paint a rozier than expected picture of US consumer spending. The credit quality in a credit quality of Bank of America in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment delinquencies are much lower than they were in any average, five best year type period, and just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much low in the event. So consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed, you can see the unemployment numbers, and they have good credit. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Charlie Wells, who's been getting across all of the details around the banking sector, of course, Charlie Good Morning. So what did we learn? Let's start with the Bank of America's story then, because a nice barometer on their business, but also the broader economic picture. That's such a good point. You know, it's the second largest bank in America, and they had a good day yesterday. So of course, we saw net interest income up higher than expected. It was expected to be high, but it hit $13.8 billion, so you know, they can think the fed for that. But also when you think about trading, that actually came in better than expected as well. So, you know, debt trading performance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4150,2022-10-18 06:49:08
15805," expected to be high but it hit 13.8 billion dollars. So you know they can think the fed for that. But also when you think about trading that actually came in better than expected as well. So you know debt trading performed well. Everyone was expecting that. But when you think about equities trading which has been really difficult for banks across Wall Street, it was less bad than the bad news they were expecting. So down only 4% of Bank of America, when you look at JP Morgan they were down in that department 11%. So pretty good news. Charlie good morning and what should we expect from Goldman earnings later on today both in terms of earnings and obviously they're supposed or they're much reported restructuring. Yeah so that restructuring is going to hang over those earnings. I think everyone is wondering if they're going to talk about that possible restructuring at the earnings call as well. I mean look these are things that CEO David Solomon didn't want to do. It's consolidating trading and investment banking. It's consolidating asset management and wealth. Things that he didn't want to do. But this is a task that many think that he has to do in order to try to improve that you know price to book ratio that's below one that's below its peers. As far as earnings you know we're expecting not great news revenue overall down 16%. Looking at fees from investment banking down 54%. But the dramatic question that everyone is wondering about is are we going to get confirmation that restructuring today. Yeah absolutely. So what they're doing with the various units merging them splitting them up and the like and what what the focus on retail will look like. Away from retail we've had a lot of reports of course from from across the banking sector already. What have been the big takeaways from you when you look at the big Wall Street banks? Yes so we went into this bank earning season wondering what it would show us about the US consumer. Was it going to show strength or was it going to show weakness? We were focusing a lot on you know bad loan provisions and of course those were there but when you look at what the CEOs of America's largest banks were saying they were saying that America's consumers are in pretty good shape. We see credit card spending continuing slowing a little bit but consumers are still able to meet their obligations there. One really interesting feature is when you look at car repossessions. Bank of America has seen those at the lowest level in a very long time. So it seems like there is consumer strength but of course going forward the big question is look a lot is changing those concerns about the housing market in particular on what's going to happen to mortgage loans. So right now you know consumer strength how long can that last? Okay Charlie thank you very much Charlie Wells with an important look at what the banking sector has told us about their performers but also what it tells us about the wider US economy. Mark this is something you've been thinking about a lot isn't it the sort of strength of the US consumer. I suppose sounding here in London where the focus is on how quickly consumer confidence deteriorates in in in Europe it's easy to get sidetracked by by that more negative story. Yeah I feel like every earnings season we're playing the exact same story from the banks. I actually think Brian Moynihan we had a string from him last quarter going the consumers holding up okay and I look I think the US consumer remains very strong. I was just in the US for two weeks there is no sign of a consumer slowdown at all the US economy is still very very strong and this goes to my underlying theory that why I think rates ultimately in the US will go much higher than people think because growth is not slowing down as much as people forecast the recession in the US still probably you know it's hard to pinpoint exactly but probably you know eight months away or something like that that kind of ballpark so I think the US consumer is going to continue to spend their balance sheets were strong going to this year yes they've come down a bit but they're still quite strong they'll continue to leverage up as it slows down they'll spend money the economy will be strong we'll get more rate hikes it'll be worse for stocks longer term but not in the short term. Yeah yeah it sounds good in the short term doesn't it but of course if it means that the Fed has to hype more then we'll see right coming up on the program we'll get to our stocks to watch as we're just 10 minutes away from the start of the European trading session Swiss Reign focus as it warns of a 1.3 billion dollar hit over damages from Hurricane Ian we'll have more details on that next this is going back okay",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4151,2022-10-18 06:53:50
15806," It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an over-supply. I mean that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. Well I'm trying to prevent that but yeah, I think it's happening. You know and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates it's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe. We have eight minutes until the start of cash equity trading and the future picture look pretty positive. US features are really doing strong doing well as well. We've seen that Nasak features up by more than 2% just to under that now 1.9% higher. Let's focus in on the stocks we're watching this morning. Laura Wright joins us with an update in Laura. Good morning. So much of what we've said recently about the housing sector has been negative given the turmoil and guilt yields and mortgage markets. You have a brighter story for us today. Yes, a brighter story indeed. Bellway the affordable UK home provider out with full year results to July revenue in line with estimates three and a half billion pounds. However, there are signs of deteriorating demand in recent months because since July new home reservations down 12% year over year, the key question. Do individuals have the confidence to purchase what is likely to be the most significant expenditure of their lifetime when interest rates rising, when mortgage rates are rising. However, there are some tailwinds for Bellway. The cut in stamp duty tax is set to stay in place that will benefit their customers looking for affordable homes and first time buyers. Also, the UK government fiscal U-turn, well we've seen guilt yields drop and that should provide some relief to mortgage rates which have spiked in recent weeks. Laura, good morning. Swiss Reav came out with some extra guidance around hurricane E-N costs. What's the news there? Yeah, profit warning. The insurer is forecasting a net loss of half a billion dollars in the third quarter. Preliminary claims from Hurricane E-N are estimated to be 1.3 billion pounds. Take notes. Whistfree was in a similar situation this time last year after the hurricane season which highlights the worsening damage from natural disasters. It's also been a tough year for insurers following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, financial market volatility. But Swiss Reav committed to the 2024 profit goal at present. Okay, and let's go to, well let's keep things Swiss, shall we? Let's go to Credit Suisse. Yeah, Bloomberg scoop that the Swiss lender is considering the sale of its US asset management arm. Expected buyers would be private equity firms. There are also rumors that the Swiss lender will sell parts of the Swiss bank to fund its restructuring. Credit Suisse out with another turnaround strategy next week. For investors, it's become somewhat of a buzzword following a litany of scandals and risk errors. This news coincides with the departure of Credit Suisse's investment banking chief, Christie and Messner. Also early this morning, Philip Hilderbrand, Black Rock's vice chairman, saying there was a lack of clarity surrounding Credit Suisse's business model, which perhaps explains where shares are down almost 50% yet to date. Laura, thanks so much, Bloomberg's Laura Wright and Mark, as we've been",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4152,2022-10-18 06:57:39
15807," There was a lack of clarity surrounding credit Swiss business model, which perhaps explains where shares are down almost 50% yet to date. Laura, thanks so much. Benberg's Laura Wright. Mark, as we bring this out, we had a question from a viewer talking about the growth link with the strength of the US dollar in saying, don't you think that the strong dollar will slow growth in the US? And it's an important thing to think about as we head into another earnings season. Given it was some of those big US companies with big global footprints that did flag dollar strength, there's a bit of an issue last time around. It's definitely an issue. And we've seen earnings cut because of this, but we're not seeing our earnings growth cut. The point is, we're not seeing earnings collapse yet. We're not seeing this massive growth impact. So yes, dollar is hurting earnings. That is a story that's already in the price and will continue to be in the price. But what we really need to see for the US stock market to really fall is earnings to get slashed. And that will happen when the recession hits. And that's a story from middle of next year because the consumer is continuing to spend which is bolstering earnings. So the dollar story is valid, but not the main driver. And in the meantime, we expect a strong session. US futures point really higher. Yeah, look, absolutely. Risk on mood for the moment. And I think that overall for the next few weeks, this is a theme that can continue, but the bigger backdrop for the next six months remains negative. Mark, thank you very much. Great to have you back. Thanks a lot for standing in the past hour with us. Future's point higher. Those are the smallest rainbow. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand.

15808," MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC Welcome to the European market. Open everyone. A minute to go until the start of cash equity trading in front of the London with Tom McKenzie. MUSIC The FTE reports the B.O.E. could delay QT even further. Feeling upbeat, stocks extend a rebound after solid bank earnings from the US and negative pressure on UK markets easing. Plus, sale on the cards, Credit Suisse considers selling its US asset management business. Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia are exploring investing in the in-battleed Lenders investment bank. Tom, when you look at the futures, they seem to be supported. And looking through the fact China has delayed its quarter GDP reading. The support also comes from the UK, which was something that was a long time coming. Yes, those two catalysts. The earnings picture we heard from Bank of America. They had to squint to see any signs of pressure on the consumer. And of course, sense of relief at least temporarily around what's happening in the UK. The Bank of England, according to reports from the FTE, answering that question. How could you be buying bonds when you're preparing to sell them back onto the markets with QT? They have, according to the B.O.E. push back those plans around concerns about the vulnerabilities within the guild markets. The FTE is currently up 8 cents of a percent over in France. They can't guarantee 57 points on a day that's been described as our Caroline Conner. Our correspondent on the grounded Paris has said possibly could be shaping it to be a black Tuesday in terms of strike chaos in France, the pressure on the President Macron. Over in Spain, the Spanish Ibex currently gaining 47 points up 6 cents of a percent. We'll take in with the guilds shortly. But before we do that, let's go to the cross-asset board then. The future states are pointing to very solid gains of 1.5%. The context is the S&P closed up about 2.6% yesterday. So it broke through this important 200 week moving average on Friday. And then it came back above that on Monday. And you have even the likes of Mike Wilson, the bear over at Morgan Stanley saying you could see a technical rally on the back of this. He's looking at possibly 13% upside, at least in the short term. The dollar index softer for a second straight day. That is supportive as well to this risk on sentiment that was seeing. Currently down 2.10% to a percent. The pound is at 1.13. After gaining on the back of that report around the B.O.E. pushing back its Q.T. timeframe from the financial times it's now flat. Under 10 years, stateside below that 4% level at 3.99. Just a move of 1 basis points. Let's check in then on the guild markets then on the back of new news and additional information for investors to digest after of course the new chance that came in and ripped up the remnants of trust dynamics yesterday in the House's apparlament. So at not a great deal of movement. So a little bit of calm across these guild markets again the bank of England pushing back according to the financial times that planned Q.T. And already not from up to the 6th to the end of the month. Now it pushes it further further out. We don't have the exact time frame yet. So it's a little bit of a little bit of a change. So we're going to have a look at the market and the two-year importance of the 30 year back in focus at 4.33. Still well above the levels. Pre many budget but of course significantly down from the height of the angst around the guild market. That is the 30 year currently at 4.34. So that's the 19 groups that make up the stocks 600 about 4 on the downside but they're really barely down. They're between 0.1% and 2% of 8% lower. That's health care basic resources and energy technology and construction media actually getting some 1.3%. And you can see it's really just a couple of pressure on health care. I would point we have a great story actually on the billionaires that won during COVID Moderna is one of them. So it's interesting to see how some of their fortunes have turned quite significantly. Now let's get over to our Bloomberg and live managing editor. He has Mark, we've missed you in the morning. You're looking at UK real yields. Yes, good morning, Fran. I've missed so much excitement over the last couple of weeks. Jeremy Hunt has restored credibility to the country, saves the guild market, save the pound. Yes, maybe in the short term, but longer term, the fundamental story remains the same.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4155,2022-10-18 07:09:17
15809," Restored credibility to the country saves the guilt market, save the pound. Yes, maybe in the short term, but longer term, the fundamental story remains the same. And this is that the UK has a very large current account deficit and deeply negative real yields in a world of rising rates. And that means that unless yields go much higher and offer more attractive kind of rates for and for investors, the currents you'll have to weaken further. I think that might be a story for 2023. Let's have a little dive in. So this is a chart of where UK real yields are when you take the policy rate minus headline inflation. That's kind of the spot real base rate. It's a little bit kind of selective when we look at it, but it's saying minus 8.2%. Completely unprecedented. Going back to the last 30 years, it's completely bizarre. Now, over the last 30 years, even if you include this crazy period, the average is about 1% positive. If you go the pre-GFC era, it was normally about 3% positive, which is our worth. I think we've got to get back to. So what? I'm saying we've got to get back to 3% real yields from minus 8%. Does that mean 11% rate hikes? No, of course not, because this can happen both through inflation coming down, because remember, this is the base rate minus inflation or through rates going higher or a combination of both. So for that, we need to look a little bit forward looking. So I'm going to go to the second chart here, which is kind of looking at one way to do this in a forward looking way. This chart here is two year yields minus the 2023 full year inflation forecast. So that's a good way of kind of looking what the dynamic will be next year. And you can see that's only minus 2.6%. Fill year inflation forecast for 2023 for the UK are 6.2% at the moment. So that doesn't look as bad if we think it's got to get to about 1% at least. But it's still probably suggesting that we've got to do another maybe 350 basis points higher on rates or inflation's got to come lower. Now, I think that the recent moves by the UK government, the recent U-turns suggest more austerity, suggest a more negative growth path. So therefore, that means we might get inflation come lower and we'll also get yields higher. So I think that's probably the story we're going to trade over the next year. But until we get that picture better, the pound will be longer term under pressure. Yes, we might trade the relief story into end of year. But 2023, the pound will get weaker again unless we see this metric correct much higher. Fantastic stuff as ever, Mark Cobbmore and managing editor of M Live Mark. I should point out, a love heart has popped up in the IB chat. You don't see that very often, a lot of love for Mark Cobbmore breaking down the real yield. I've never received a love heart in the IB chat. They send it to me for you. They send it to you. Well, Mark Cobbmore has one for breaking down the real yield story. So beautifully for us, Mark, and welcome back. On your point of the pound, it's given up the gains that we saw early in the session. Currently at 1.13, flat, gilts are bid modestly, just very modestly, again, in the 30th at 4.37. And let's stay with the UK story then. The Prime Minister lives trust, apologising for the chaos caused by how many budget, but said she plans to lead the Tories into the next election. My message is we should be focusing on delivering for the British public. We are in difficult economic times. We're in difficult international times with the war being perpetrated in Ukraine. And now is the time to focus on delivering, making sure that we are delivering on our energy package. So before we stepped in, people were facing energy bills of up to £6,000. We've now put in place the energy price guarantee. We reverse the national insurance increase. And that's what I'm thinking about as Prime Minister. Now, for more, we're joined by Bloomberg. Lizzy Birdon, Lizzy, it seems that trust is really hanging by a thread. We were looking at the papers this morning, and she pretty much got slammed across the board. Yeah, you saw her in that interview with the BBC, desperately trying to reassure the public that she's in control. She meets her cabinet this morning to try and persuade them that she, indeed, is still the one in power. But as you say, the reality is the consensus in Westminster is she's only clinging on. Only months ago, we were talking about Johnson's government as a zombie government in its last week's in power, and the feeling is much the same. Tory MPs, I ask, say it's when, not if she's going to go. Ministers and aides even agree, but press them and they can't decide who would replace her.

Yesterday in the Commons it almost seemed like a bit of an audition between her cabinet as to who would take the top job. And then they can't agree how they would replace her without a general election. And that's something no Tory wants. Labour now has a 25-year record poll lead over the Tories. So they seem to be waiting for the herd to turn against her, but publicly at least the herd is only five MPs right now. OK, we continue to watch that story, of course, damning headlines. Wow. The Ghost Prime Minister, the Daily Mail in office, but not in power. Bloomberg's Lizzie Birdon, thank you very much indeed. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Christina Kino and Ben Guthridge asset management director of model portfolio services at Invesco, Amir. Christine, we'll start with you on what we're seeing in terms of these guilt markets on the back of this FT reporting then. Skills now selling off just a little bit. So yields up about two basis points on the two year, close to two basis points on the 30 year. So choppiness in these guilt markets in the first few minutes of trade. What do you make of this reporting around the B.O.E.? It was inevitable, wasn't it, that they were going to have to push back QT again? That's exactly right, Tom. I think it was widely expected that QT would definitely be out of the picture, at least for now, especially with the chaos that we saw in the guilt market over the last few weeks. And so a little bit of confirmation on this from the B.O.E. sources that we saw this morning really just speaks to the urgency of the state of the guilt market at the moment and why the B.O.E. felt the need to delay this process. And I think, you know, as far as the sell-off goes or are calling Mark Cudmer is absolutely correct. I think now that those, some of those pressures that we saw over the last few weeks seem to be easing a little bit. I think the focus is returning back to the UK fundamental story, which is still not very great at this point in time. We're looking at near double digit inflation across the living crisis in a B.O.E. that still has to kind of pivot back to its inflation fight. It had been distracted from that from that the last few weeks, but that still very much remains an issue for the bank. Ben, what if you look at some of the volatile too that we've seen? I mean, how long does this rally last? As Christian was saying, fundamentals in the UK aren't great. Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to pinpoint how long the rally will last exactly. But, you know, I think markets will fret about the political shenanigans. And of course, we know the story's not yet over at Downing Street. It's certainly suspect it's not. But, you know, the collection of policies that so riled markets just a few short weeks ago, you know, it's pretty clear that we're not going back to that. And there has been sort of commitment to a reversal on it. And I think the Bank of England has shown its credentials here in terms of fighting inflation and its willingness to sort of stand against, you know, that collection of policies, the unfunded tax cuts that would sort of seem to be so inflationary. So I think, you know, of course, as I said, the political noise can throw guilt yields, can throw the pound around a little bit in the short term. But I think we're not going back to that collection of policies. So there is room for a bit of a run here for positive run for the pound. But in terms of the risk premium that is now priced into UK assets, when do we get that back down? What do you need to see to see that coming back down to kind of pre-mini budget levels? Well, at times, certainly. But also affirmation that, you know, the Bank of England is going to manage technical, because things can break, you know, when you have these sort of guilt yield spikes or any bond yield spikes, things can break and we've seen a bit of a disturbance or slightly larger than a bit of a disturbance in the pension's market. And so the Bank of England has got to manage that, but also take on these inflationary threats. And it's, you know, it's a bit of a juggling act at the moment. I think it's managing it okay, but combination of that, uncertainty about what else could sort of fall over, post this sort of move higher in interest rates plus the political noise. You know, it could be a bit of an uneasy ride. But I think that that risk premium will fade based on sort of things I mentioned. But Ben, we heard from business groups, right, welcoming the chance or the attempt to come markets. But at the same time, they call this economically rudderless with no long-term time and tax burden stack at the highest in 70 years. And you have trade unions, you know, saying, well, guys go on strike because of the high inflation costs and, you know, the return of austerity. Yeah, yeah, it's a bad news. It's, again, it's a good news. No, no, no, no, good. But this is not only about political kind of meander.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4156,2022-10-18 07:15:49
15811," The high inflation costs and the return of austerity. Yeah, it's a bad news. So again, it's a bad news. Right, this is not only about political kind of meandering. Yeah, well, I mean, there is clearly an economic squeeze here. The inflationary challenge, even though the Bank of England is tackling it, will take a long time to come under control. And a lot of it is not within the Bank of England's gift, of course. Bit commodity prices, the geopolitical challenges. What happens in terms of US demand, but perhaps it's not too far away before the inflation delta starts moving in a more favorable direction. All right, Ben, thank you so much. Christina Kino from our markets team, Ben Gutierrez, assets management director of model portfolio services and Vesco Yemea stays with us. Now, coming up, we'll have a full roundup of the markets and why Muhammad Ilarian says it's getting harder to justify the feds' independence. We'll discuss that next. This is Blueberg. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is a whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. We will have a break, we will have a break, build all our foundation strong enough to stay. We will never know, we will never know. We will have a break. Welcome back to the Open 15 minutes and two, the European trading day. We will have a break. We will have a break. We will have a break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4157,2022-10-18 07:18:45
15812," He said an independent central bank is critical for the US economy, whether it's getting harder to justify after four big operational errors. Joining us now is, or stay with us, is Ben Guteris from Invesco asset management. Ben, Fed independence, Muhammad LRM, of course, was out early and out front in criticizing the Fed for not going earlier on on rate hikes and addressing the inflation challenges. Is this a real challenge to Fed independence? Is the damage done to this institution that deep? Well, I wouldn't question Muhammad's opinion relative to my own, but I think the Fed's independence is secure. I think there is a lot of concern and a voice about the potential delay or the speed with which they pivoted to becoming more hawkishness. But at that time, there was a lot of economic uncertainty in hindsight. It was still a very uncertain period. I think if we look at long-term inflation expectations, they still remain in target. Always question marks around the choices that central banks make. But no, I don't think it's the time to be calling for an end to their independence. I don't think he's quite doing that. It's getting harder to justify because of four big operational errors he says, which is analysis for cast actions and communication, and frankly the lack of accountability. Why were central banks so off the mark and what does it mean for you to have to be in the markets, you're invested in equities, should you hold them accountable? Well, I think one of the reasons that people have been, or the credibility issues has been raised, is their inflation forecasting has been offside, as has so many people. And here I am about to give you my inflation forecast that could well fall foul of the same challenge. But I think obviously the latest CPI print was a bit hot. The labour market remains strong. But there could just be cracks appearing in the labour market. These lead indicators on inflation do point to a bit of a reversal coming as we move into year end. So maybe this November hype marks the end of three calls to point. And that is the key call from Ben. Is there a number of potentially market key call? And if that is your call, then is now the time to start positioning for that within equities. And if so, where? Well, I think what broadly equities should do okay if this does mark that pivot. I think it does seem to be relatively priced in. Three quarters is the last one, as we move to December, we move to a half. But I think the markets will still welcome some reassurance on that. And some communication, some language from the Federal Reserve, that we're now going to look at the data more rather than be showing so resolutely hawkish. There might be more reflection of the data. So equities could yet enjoy a nice run into the end of the year. And we would prefer US equities and the basis that that view could be wrong. And there has some sort of defensiveness quality to it. But after I think if the labour market doesn't show signs of calling, then maybe the Fed can't pause. Maybe has to revert to hiking again and then equity markets could be a bit more trouble. What do you think is priced in at the moment, Ben? The question is, what do you think is the most important thing to be concerned, you know, speaking to policymakers, is that even if you look at the base case now for a Fed, then we need to repricate bonds and equities though. Well, I mean, I think what's priced into the bond market is three quarters in November, and then half a percent into the end of the year, and then a couple and then a pause. And then actually maybe cuts next year. So you might not actually, I think in the short term, I think equities have got that priced in. So if the Fed makes that pivot, then equities can enjoy that relief rally. If you do get that pivot, then I don't think bond markets move that much. But thereafter, if the Fed decide actually the labour market is still pretty strong, and we're only going to pause, in fact, we might revert to hiking rates, then that duration position, those longer bonds, could still be in a bit of bother. But I think equities can enjoy something of a relief rally from here on a Fed pivot. Alright, Ben, thanks so much. Ben Gutford's there from Invesco Asset Management.

15813,"fi China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. How did Jeff Bezos realize you could sell anything on the internet? The web was growing at something like 2300% a year. Anything growing that fast is going to be big.

On the David Rubenstein show I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders right here on Bloomberg. On the David Rubenstein show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg television. Welcome back to the open we are 23 minutes into the European trading day. You're seeing gains of 510s of a percent across the stock 600. The US S&P eminies 20 years of 1.4% and that's that futures that ended up or around 3.5%. Yesterday, currently points of gains of 1.6%. And in your guilt markets you're looking at some very, very modest selling pressure just at one basis point move lower. In terms of the yields on the 10 year and the 30 year currently at 4.39. Of course, the financial time is reporting that the BOE is pushing out its plans for quantitative tightening. Now, Bank of the Centre for Executive Chair and Aboutin has welcomed UK Chancellor Jeremy Hansen's decision to roll back most of the government's controversial tax cutting plans. Well, speaking exclusively to Bloomberg, Boatin called the move's steps in the right direction. And she also talked about the ongoing risks of high inflation. We are a big lender in the UK. We are one of the top mortgage lenders and with a very low risk portfolio, 40% low to value. But clearly what is happening in the UK is affecting consumers, is affecting businesses. But I'd say the world is living through a period of, I'd say, unprecedented economic stress added by, you know, with the geopolitics and the national politics. What's really difficult at times like this for governments, but also for businesses, is to get the balance right between what's urgent and important, which is fighting inflation, but at the same time, making sure we're laying the foundations for growth. And of course, fiscal policy has to be aligned with monetary policy. And I think that is the balance that was not right in the UK. That's what markets were telling us. And at the end, it's about, and I'm very pleased by the steps that have been taken. I think it's important to give stability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4159,2022-10-18 07:28:03
15814," UK, that's what markets were telling us. And at the end, it's about, and I'm very pleased by the steps that have been taken. I think it's important to give stability and confidence as much as we can, not just to markets, but to consume us and businesses. We are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps taken are in the right direction. You talk about the global situation economically. I know you've just come from Washington. You attended those IMF World Bank meetings. Give us a sense of the perception at Banco Santander, of where we stand globally right now, because we have a lot of inflation around the world. We have a lot of central banks raising their interest rates, slowing economy, and also a war in Europe. How does that all come together? Because IMF is worried about the possibility of a recession now. Well, we're at levels of inflation. We have not seen in decades. And we're also seeing government that's being at very high levels. So again, what's important? And this has profound implications for customers, for consumers, for businesses, for society. And so getting that inflation down is really important. And I like to say this is a disease that requires antibiotics. It's not going to be cured with vitamin C. And of course, you have a conflicting fiscal policies. And that's happening in many countries. And so making sure that they're not going to want one against the other is important. Well, that was Banco Santander's executive chair, and of course, a huge presence here in the UK. Now, coming up, Biden downplays recession risks, the Bloomberg economics recession, probability model, actually says a downturn under his watch is in your certainty. We also need to talk a bit about the midterm elections. And of course, everything that's going on in China, Tom. Yeah, at a turn on that inflation call, the economy call, of course, when the US is looking at further releases of its strategic reserves of petroleum. As they lead up to those elections, of course, inflation is central. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg.Narrator So the inflation environment has been changing a little bit. The inflation has been very low for 25 years and now people think inflation is coming back. How are you going to deal with that? I think many of the tools that we've historically used to battle inflation no longer work in the same ways they used to. I think people oftentimes thought of housing as a way or especially retail and real estate as a way to hedge against inflation less and less possible the way we've invested in it. I think commodity similarly have been thought of as a way to hedge against inflation. Their challenges over the long-term equities have been a hedge against inflation. We will continue to do what we have done in the past which is build a diversified portfolio where there are many different opportunities that have the possibility of hedging against inflation because different types of inflation have to be hedged in different ways. So if it's a very quick increase of inflation as opposed to a slow rise of inflation, is it temporary? Is it a long and persistent type of inflation? So for us, I never model myself an economist that can predict where inflation is going. So what I need to do is build a diversified portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4160,2022-10-18 07:32:29
15815, An economist that can predict where inflation is going. And so what I need to do is build a diversified portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation and to pay close attention to it. And fundamentally it's done through the equity markets. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. Welcome back to the Open. Everyone 30 minutes into the European trading den here are your top stories. Crisis management to the UK Chancellor rips up lose trust as controversial economic plan. As a PM apologizes for the chaos the FT reports that the BOE could delay QT even further. Feeling upbeat stocks extend a rebound after solid bank earnings from the US and negative pressure when UK markets eased. Plus sale on the cards. Credit squeeze considers selling its US asset management business shares in the empatel swiss lender open hire. Tom if you look at stocks overall they seem to be actually extending a rebound. Yeah there's the earnings optimism and there's the reduction of the UK financial risk after of course Jeremy Hunt the Chancellor ripped up 90% arguably of trust andomics yesterday. The Prime Minister says she's going to cling on hold on and continue to govern up until the elections about two years out we'll see if that actually happens. Across the benchmark you see gains of 6.10 of 8% in Germany. Pretty solid picture there gains of 140 points up more than 1% over on the German benchmark. The FT 118.85% up 58 points again on the reporting as well from the Bank of England. From the FT the BOE will push out its QT. Last time I checked there wasn't a lot of movement in GILTS but of course we continue to focus on the politics of the UK but also the earnings picture and that has come out pretty solidly particularly with the banks stateside. Let's move on to how things are playing out sector by sector then of course the context as well is that the SMP ended up about 2.6% yesterday the NASDAQ closing close to 3.5% higher and the SMP holding up above this 200 week moving average on Monday a key technical level for some and potentially further support certainly Mike Wilson over at Morgan Stanley says there could be a bear market rally in the offing of maybe up to 13% technology gaining at 1.3% in the session construction materials also up by more than 1% at the bottom there's just three sectors in the red including basic resources and real estate currently down 5.10 of 8% continue to watch of course what is happening in China the party Congress there as well as further pressure on that real estate sector what that means in terms of the demand for basic resources francing now let's get straight to the Bloomberg business flash here's Laura right Hylara high-fronting credit suites is considering a sale of its US asset management business that's as the firm is a strategy revamp that's likely to reshape its business and top ranks according to sources familiar with the matters the Swiss bank recently began the process to sell the US operations we're told the division is likely to attract interest from private equity firms no comment from credit suites bank of America shares jumped yesterday after the bank reported third quarter results with trading revenues holding firm the bank also delivered strong net interest income with an increase of roughly 24% CEO Brian Winhand says the consumer is remaining resilient their credit quality in a credit quality bank of America in our consumer books is very strong across the board the payment the linkancies are much low and they were pre pandemic much lower than they were in any average five best year type period and just they moved a little bit off the floor but they're still much low in the bend so consumers are spending they have money they're employed you can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit that's the Bloomberg business last time for unseen Laura thank you so much for our right in London so let's get more on the economy president Biden downplaying the chance of a recession but Bloomberg economics recession probability model suggests that a downturn on his watch is close to a certainty now we're now joined by Vanguard asset management chief economist Dumana Selaheen thank you so much Dumana for joining us I mean it does feel like everything is turning into a perfect storm in terms of inflation make policy mistakes from the fed at,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4161,2022-10-18 07:36:54
15816," Management Chief Economist, Jumana Sallaheen, thank you so much for joining us. I mean, it does feel like everything is turning into a perfect storm in terms of inflation, maybe policy mistakes from the Fed and other central banks. Can the US at this point really avoid a recession? I think for this year, they probably will, because the labour market data is still very strong. So, I think this year, it probably can avoid a recession. Going into next year, obviously, as policy keeps tightening, we start to see that effect in the real economy, it will get harder. Yeah, we were speaking to Ben Guthrie, Vimvesco, earlier in the show, and he said he sees a pivot from the Fed, possibly after a 75 basis point high from in November from the Federal Reserve. Is that something, a trajectory that you would see as plausible at this point, given the inflation dynamics that were starting to see in the US? No, I think we've got quite a different view. Our view is that rates are going to continue to rise into spring of next year, and we see the terminal rate above 4% now, the terminal rate being the rate at which interest rates will peak during this tightening cycle. By about 4%, do you see 4.6%, the dot plots are 4.6% next year. Is that the level you're looking at? Yes, we are. We're pretty much in line with the dot plot. Joanna, in a previous life, you were actually head of division for the Fender's Disability of the Bank of England. Yep. I mean, how's the Bank of England handling this crisis here in the UK? Well, I think it's been good. You know, there were a few risks taken last week in terms of when Andrew Bailey said you've got three days left to sort things out, but that turned out in the end to be a good thing. Do you, we've got this reporting from the financial times, they're going to push out QT again. It was pretty inconceivable that one week they're stepping in and buying bonds the next week, they're going to be selling them off again. This is a logical conclusion, surely, of the pressures that you're seeing in the gilt market. Do you expect that? I mean, does it make sense, first of all, and when can they step back in with QT, do you think? Yeah, I think that's a really good question. I think there's some confusion out there on what QE, what QT, what these terms actually mean. And there's different types of intervention. There's the intervention that the Bank of England did recently to help the pensions market. That was a different type of intervention. It was more for financial stability reasons, but it looks the same, right? It looks taste-feel the same, but actually it's very, very different. The monetary easing type of QE, when you're actually intervening there to alter the slope of the yield curve, to bring yields down in the future, that's kind of monetary policy which you can't do when rates are at the zero lower bound. I do also want to say that central banks around the world, we don't actually know much about QT. We've learned a little bit about QE, we know when it works, what works, what best, when markets are stressed, and with QT, the conventional wisdom right now is that it will work best when markets are calm. We can put that money back in, huge balance sheets, we're talking about 30, 40% of balance sheets in Europe and the US, Europe, sorry, ECB 70%, almost. And so these huge balance sheets need to be unwound at some point. We know that the best way to do that is when markets are calm. And that's not where we are right now. But there seems to be a fundamental problem in some of the analysis, and we've asked the Bank of England this many times, is that how much QT equals to a 5%-10% interest rate increase, and until we really understand and know that, is there a danger of overtightening? I mean, that's a really great question, and that's something that Vanguard has been doing our own proprietary research and trying to map that. That's what everybody's saying. What is this, what is this? What we found is that we sort of see that 80 billion of unwinding which the Bank of England has said, that would be equivalent to about 30 basis points. So not much, but that's on the condition of markets are calm. When markets are stressed, those effects are much, much more amplified, and that's why they can't give you a good answer, is because we don't know much about how QT works. Mark Cardmore from our LMIM team was illustrating for us just how deeply negative real yields still are here in the UK, and the prospect of, at least the prospect of pretty aggressive heights in the B.O.E. My question for you is how much work has already been done in terms of inflation from what's happening in the energy sector, the energy sector across corporates and households at mortgage rates levels that are in the cost of living crisis. That is surely taking some of that demand out that the B.O.E. would be seeking to address. Yeah, no, absolutely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4162,2022-10-18 07:41:44
15817," Corporates and households at mortgage rates levels that are in the cost of living crisis. That is surely taking some of that demand out that the B.O.E. would be seeking to address. Yeah, no, absolutely. High inflation erodes away the real spending power of individuals. They're in, come so when they go out to the shops, they can't buy as much and therefore demand has to fall. So that channel is definitely in operation. The challenge though is that inflation is still at 10% and rising and we've got to get that inflation down. So even though some of that impact is working right now, there is this battle between prices and wages, right? So if wages keep rising, you get that wage-price spiral and that will push you into the world that we don't want to be, the non-desirable world of high inflation, the high inflation era. And in order to get back to that low inflation, the world that we love, we want stable, predictable, of 2%, we are going to need more rate hikes than inflation working its way through. Because the signaling channel is quite important too. J.M. when's the right time to beat hard action on some of these interest rate raises? And again, we're also hearing, for example, from a lot of the unions saying to workers fight against austerity. So now we're in a bit of a policy limbo where we've gone away from trust dynamics, but actually unclear what we see and live through in the next 18 months. I mean, I think what we're seeing now with announcements yesterday is that fiscal and monetary policy, I'm working more in harmony with each other. And that's a good thing. And I think going forward, we have to see, we have to see, there's still a few more announcements out there that we have to wait. What is the direction? What is the OBR going to say? So a bit more to play out. We heard from the ECB's Villeaux-Hoye, of course, of the Bank of France saying that he sees a slower pace of rate hikes, once 2% is reached and some within the market is taking a bit of heart from that. Is that a trajectory for the ECB that seems feasible at this point? Yeah, I think that's a feasible rate. So in the ECB, obviously structural factors mean that our view of the neutral rate is lower. So we view the terminal rate to be 2.5% in Europe, whereas in contrast, what I said for the US and the UK, it's more above 4%. So yes, in the ECB, there's a slightly different trajectory, given the structure or the fundamentals of the economy are different. OK, Germana Sallihin, a Vanguard asset management chief economist. Thank you very much for all things, BOE Fed and the ECB as well. Coming up, recession fears are growing, but such warnings are hard to find in Wall Street's results. A deeper look into that, the resilience that we're seeing, particularly within the banking space. This is Blinkberg. Is it possible the industries in an arm's race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which all the three companies can satisfy that need.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4163,2022-10-18 07:45:24

But that is also going sentiment towards riskier assets. Now let's shift focus to US bank, which are reporting this week. Bank of America, the latest big lender to paint a rozier, unexpected picture of the US consumer. Their credit quality in a credit quality bank of America in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment delinquencies are much lower in their work, their pre-pandemic, much lower in their work, and they were in any average five best year type period. And just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they are still much lower in their bend. So consumers are spending, they have money, they are employed, you can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit. So let's bring in Bloomberg's Charlie Wells, our expert in all things at finance. Charlie, I feel like I don't know whether the pain is yet to come because yesterday it felt like it was quite rosy, but actually then it's going to get worse in terms of cost living crisis, is it not? Yeah, sort of a weight and sea approach, and at least if you see right now, it looks pretty good. So Brian Moynihan and Bank of America had a pretty good day yesterday. Net interest income, bead expectations, 13.8 billion, the expectation had been 13.6. But when you look away from this beneficiary of the Fed's higher interest rates, you also see trading during pretty well, so we were expecting that trading to do well, but also when you look at equities trading. That was expected to underperform, but it did last bad than you expected, so about a 4% drop. Compare that to JPMorgan, they had an 11% drop in the same period, so Bank of America, pretty good news there. Yeah, I think it was Moynihan who said you had to squint to see any any pressure. It was one of those executives. One of those executives, because they're lovely line, you had to squint to see any pressure on the consumer. Is Goldman going to continue this positive run? What are you looking for them from their results? That's a good question, Tom. Goldman reports in a few hours and there's going to be a very big elephant in the room when they report, which is this potential restructuring. Now, we're seeing the bank potentially, bringing together a number of business units, investment banking and trading, and one unit asset management and wealth and another. And these are things that CEO David Solman didn't want to do. We're seeing also the potential of that consumer banking unit effectively being disseminated, sort of across the firm. And expectations are low. This is a different type of bank revenue overall, probably down 16 percent, according to estimates, fees from investment banking potentially down 54 percent. And this is a part of a big strategic problem that Solman has is he needs to try to bring that price to book ratio to a better place than it is right now, especially compared to his peers. So we know not all banks are created equal. Who, I mean, can you break it down? Eventually, is it more the retail that's not doing as badly as expected and some of the investment bank may be under pressure, depending on the pipelines? Right. So yeah, they're the biggest banks, but they are so different, right? So somehow, these really entrenched consumer units, some or more have been more focused on investment banking, have been desperately seeking, more regularized streams of revenue that they can get at any point in time. And what we really saw here was those banks that seem to have this reliance on the consumer, at least a larger consumer segment, doing well. And it seems to speak, at least positively right now for the health of the American consumer, can credit cards.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4164,2022-10-18 07:50:07
15819," This reliance on the consumer, at least a larger consumer segment, doing well. And it seems to speak, you know, at least positively right now for the health of the American consumer. Credit card spending is continuing. It grew at some banks. We're seeing people able to meet those obligations. And also, when you think about even things like car repossessions, which no one ever wants to have, Bank of America actually reported those were half the level that they'd seen in a very long time. So getting back to that question you asked first, Francine, what is the state of the American consumer cost of living crisis? It seems like in the US, the US consumer is holding up so far. Yeah, those household balance sheets. Goldman Sachs aren't going to be won't benefit from that as much. We'll look ahead to their results later today, Charlie Wells. Thank you very much indeed. Credit Swiss meanwhile is considering the sale of its US asset management business. That's as a strategy revamp approaches. Meanwhile, Middle East sovereign wealth funds are said to be weighing whether to put money into the Swiss Lenders investment bank. Let's get more then from Bloomberg's global equity market senior reporter Jan Patrick Barnett. What is the latest when it comes to credit squeeze? It seems like a bit of a lifeline then for this lender. Well, what we're seeing right now makes total sense to me because it goes into two directions that I guess investors want to see and investors wanted to see actually in the early early risk, factoring that British Swiss did and there were disappointed. So the one thing is that they're going to focus on the wealth management core business and that means that the investment bank has to go someplace else and a sale there or a spin off or whatever they want to call it makes the most sense and that there are some people interested in going into this business makes also total sense to me. The other one and this is kind of a European theme I would say is that the US business European banks are struggling to get a big footprint there and go to scale and we have seen that with Deutsche Bank a couple of years ago, a retreating from that market we have seen it with a B&P selling the bank of the West and our credit Swiss thinking about selling the US asset management. So again, that makes sense here to sell a non-core business where they probably struggle to make a big clock here. JP, you speak to a lot of insiders and say it's a bit of a ship per act also because a lot of the talents have exited. What happens to this bank? Well, that is a big question. So what we want to see now is like we want to see that as that the management is sure and decisive on the restructuring that they give the bank a new branding so to speak in new direction and that is the foundation I would say to keep silent and to attract new talent. This will take time so I'm pretty sure the bleeding will continue for a while longer the reputation is bad, working there probably is like not the bad atmosphere right now. So this will take time but the first thing we want to see is like give the bank a direction give it confidence and then you can build up talent again. Thank you so much. Bloomberg's global equity markets. I'm losing my voice time because I'm so excited about some of the news stories but that was a global equity market senior reporter if I can get it out to Jan Patrick Barnett.

Welcome back to the open 53 minutes into your European training day. You're seeing gains across the benchmark of 8 tenths of percent here in Europe. Futures in the US point out by 1.6 percent on the S&P evenings. Now that futures after posting gains of more than 3 percent, almost 3.5 percent yesterday, adding to that today with the futures looking up by 1.8 percent. That's for the tech, heavy index. Keep an eye on what's happening in the guilt markets in the UK after the FT reported that the bank of England will be pushing back its QT program. This of course after the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt ripped up treasonomics yesterday in the hands of the parliament currently. There is a little bit of a move into guilt at the front. 10, 356, that's a move lower by two basis points. The all important 30 year at 4.36, that's a move lower by one basis point. So a sense of at least for now, some stability within the guilt markets. The context of course is that you'll know where near getting back to the levels pre-many budget, when the 30 year was at about 3.5 or thereabouts. Currently 4.36, lower by two basis points on the 30 year. Okay, let's get the Bloomberg first word new now. Use now with Laura. Laura. Thanks Tom. In the UK, Liz Truss has apologized for her mistakes, but vowed to remain prime minister for the national interest. It comes after the new chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, reversed most of her economic plan. It leaves Truss in office, but without the power to proceed with her tax cutting agenda. Now I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I fix mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Schultz has ordered an extension of the country's three remaining nuclear plants until April 2023. The decision is designed to end the standoff between his two coalition partners. The Greens are ideologically opposed to nuclear power, but the business-friendly free Democrats argue Germany should use all the generation capacity available to tackle the crisis. Britain's reversal on its controversial tax cutting plans are a step in the right direction. That's according to Anna Boetin, the chair of one of the UK's leading lenders, Presentaire of Labor hairy andkehrs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4166,2022-10-18 07:58:51

She says it's important to give stability and confidence, not just to markets, but to consumers and businesses. We are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps are taken out in the right direction. Chinese junk dollar bonds have dropped to a record low. That's as the property crisis is showing few signs of improving.

15822," on the David Rubenstein show here to peer conversations I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg television this is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake Bloomberg welcome to daybreak Australia this is Bloomberg technology welcome to Bloomberg crypto this is Bloomberg surveillance early edition with Francine Markwell well good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg surveillance early edition just checking the markets here in front of the lack of London and here's what's coming up on today's program crisis management the UK Chancellor rips up who this trust is controversial economic plan as a piano apologizes for the chaos the FT also reports of the B.O.E. could delay QT even further feeling upbeat stocks extend rebound after solid bank earnings from the US and negative pressure on UK markets east plus sale on the cards will credit sues considers selling its US asset management business shares in the in battle swiss lender open higher now first thing is first let's check in on the markets and we did see quite a lot of these markets actually continuing to be a void a lot of these stocks extending this rebound this is as the UK efforts to foster greater stability in its volatile bond market seems for the moment to be working I'm looking at European stocks overall they're extending against S&P futures also getting some 1.7% we had encouraging figures from Bank of America also the words that came out of the chief executive officer Brian Moynihan pretty encouraging the US 10 year yield 3.9 7.9 8 we have a great read with Muhammad Aryan saying that because of the lack of accountability of the Fed we should look at the four errors that they made and look at its independence finally this is a picture across the board when it comes to European maps so European stocks are up a couple of stories that we will be covering for you of course the UK are a Lizzie Burton is outside number 10 and then the CAC 40 gaining 1.2% huge days of strikes in France because of of course the energy crisis over the next couple of days now the UK Prime Minister Liz Truss has apologized for the chaos caused by Hermany budget but she says that she plans to lead the Tories into the next election my message is we should be focusing on delivering for the British public we are in difficult economic times we're in difficult international times with the war being perpetrated in Ukraine and now is the time to focus on delivering making sure that we are delivering on our energy package so before we stepped in people were facing energy bills of up to 6,000 pounds we've now put in place the energy price guarantee we reverse the national insurance increase and that's what I'm thinking about as Prime Minister now for more we're joined by Bloomberg, Lizzie Burton and Lizzie I know you've been working nonstop I don't know if you've had any sleep over for us like three weeks has the new chance or Jeremy Hunt you know done enough to stabilize the economic situation to shore up Truss's position well I have to say he's done an awful lot in a day hasn't he and it's hard to and in Kvingland and the Treasury but on the other hand without the sugar rush the recession risks are heightened and even though Hunt has pretty much nukeed Trussonomics he's still got to pay the more on risk premium as T.S. Lombard puts it and that has a cost our economists say that borrowing is going to be 10 billion pounds a year more expensive by 2025 because of the damage Truss has caused to the UK's economic credibility and so one guest on Bloomberg TV yesterday defined Huntonomics as soon economics on steroids and in a sense it has to be because Hunt needs to be more fiscally disciplined he's going to have to find spending cuts to make up for what's come before and Labour is dubbing this austerity 2.0 it's difficult politically he's also appointed Rupert Harrison from BlackRock as an economic adviser it's a tricky link optically because Harrison was George Osborne's right-hand man in the austerity years",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4168,2022-10-18 08:07:15
15823," He's also appointed Rupert Harrison from BlackRock as an economic adviser. It's a tricky link optically because Harrison was George Osborne's right hand man in the austerity years. No matter how respected he is in markets, no matter how welcome it is that Truss is finally acknowledging the need to listen to the economic orthodoxy. So it's going to be a scary political path leading up to the Halloween budget. So the Prime Minister seems to be hanging on by a thread. Are there any realistic contenders to replace her, Lizzie? Or is there an understanding that actually they can't call us over one single person so she stays in power for a bit longer? But what a reason to keep a Prime Minister in number 10 downing street. It doesn't exactly underscore a powerful Prime Minister. Yesterday in the Commons it seemed almost like an audition by the various members of Truss's cabinet for the top job. You had Penny Morden, the leader of the Commons, standing in for Truss. She had to explain that Truss was not in fact hiding under a desk. Then you had the various appearances from Jeremy Hunt, the new Chancellor. And conspicuously absent was Rishie Sunak, the former Chancellor, who many are hoping will step back into the fray and take over. Really, it's not just a question of who would take over but how they would take over without bringing about a general election. Which none of the Tories want given that the Labour Party now has a 25 year record poll lead over the Tories. But what I'm hearing in Westminster, an interesting argument to square the circle that Sunak could make, is that he was Johnson's Chancellor. Johnson was ousted more for conduct reasons than policy reasons. So perhaps Sunak could try to draw on Boris Johnson's 2019 landslide election victory mandate. Lizzie, thank you so much, Lizzie Burden there, of course at Westminster for us. Now we're also joined by Elizabeth Dois ahead of the AMA equity research at City. And thank you so much for joining us. What a world wind. We've had in the UK over the last two to three weeks. Are you, is there anything that looks attractive? I was going to say, are you going back into some of the UK assets right now? Good morning, Francine. Well, I think, you know, if we take a step back in what's happening in the UK, the market has taken a view, certainly, you know, relatively negative view. And the idea is, you know, the question our economist was asking is, you know, is essentially all the UK disruption, a template for something more severe globally. And I guess we've had a sense of relief yesterday with at least on the face of it, you know, fiscal policy seemed more in a good in ad equation with monetary policy. In terms of what we're looking at from an equity market perspective, we still expect, you know, gains by the end of 2023, but meanwhile some volatility. How we would look at equity specifically, of course, we remember that the UK market specifically is not directly into the UK economy. It's, you know, the UK stock exchange is obviously, you know, made up of a large number of multinational, and it's the same for European, the European market. So what we favor at the moment, our key targets are, you know, we have now will move to favor the defensive of the cyclicals. Remember the beginning of the year, we were really worried about real yields and the impact of their rise on equities. Really now, well, you know, if there's any issues with equities, we're really worried about downgrades to estimates and to EPS. And remember, we're in full, full, full, huge for a result season. So we're really favoring defensive, specificicals and we can go into sectors in a minute. So is there anything in these first of all, and I don't know whether you do it, you know, thematically or actually country by country, if interest rates rise very quickly, like they have so far, but that gets accelerated. And what are the parts of the markets that are over leveraged, and so what does that mean for your exposure to, you know, equities that could have ripple effects or that could be invested in those. So second round effects. Yes, I mean, interest rate rise in general, you know, we really look at the rise of real yields, you know, and so we are just interest rate rise for inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4169,2022-10-18 08:11:51
15824," Yes, I mean, interest rate rise in general, you know, we really look at the rise of real yields, you know, and so we are just interest rate rise for inflation. And you know, that correlation has played that already and it is less worry about that. You're right to point, obviously issues around leverage and you know sector by sector, you know, we're going to know, you know, have to look at that and you know, the market is certainly starting to price that in. I don't think there's any particular sector that actually is over leveraged at the moment that's not something that we've looked at, but it's going to be within each sector that is going to move towards more stock picking and really looking at those balance sheets. I think really again, I would look back at defenses versus cyclicals and we're really favoring, for example, right now multinationals with, you know, a broad set of earnings that can. And of notably, a certain currency weaknesses and benefit from a strong dollar, so particularly in Europe that's going to be luxury goods, for example, very, very nice sector because it's got very strong growth still coming in. And it's a sector that has massively derated. We're going to favor, of course, the traditional defensive likes health care and telco. So, Elise, we're just getting a headline saying that the UK Prime Minister trusts net favorability has slumped to minus 70. This is in a UGF survey. This is a pretty much its approval rating of the current Prime Minister, Elise Trust. I know Elise, you know, it's difficult to quantify what that means for future economic policies or earnings across the road. But where do you see the pound headed? I know weakness and pound because of the overseas exposure to a lot of these companies, as you said, have just made it very attractive. Yeah, so let's take a step back and pick the very elements. You know, political instability markets have had to compose with that for a while now. Again, I think the UK is only another test for the many vulnerabilities we could see in the market. And it's been in focus. We've had a bit of relief with the announcement. But the flip side of these announcements is obviously there's constantly less economic support than last week for the UK. And just this morning, our UK economist has done great is GDP forecast to mine to 1.6 percent recession next year versus the original 0.5. And it's no longer due to our implications. In terms of of the pound, where we see it headed, you know, at City, we'll continue to forecast strong dollar. So obviously all our forecast and all our picks are based on that. in terms of stock picking, we would continue to favor, as I say, large multinational, and the UK market specifically, again, is composed of much of that. It derated significantly, it's trading at nine times. I think eventually, you can get good exposure there. Remember, there are some challenge sectors as well. We continue to believe that the retail sector, particularly in the UK, will be very challenged to a wavy look consensus on the retail sector. Elise, thanks so much. Elise Bedouade, head of VMA, equity research at City, stays with us. We'll talk a little bit more broadly also about the situation in France and Italy. Coming up, the Santander Executive Chair, Anna Boutin, weighs in on the turmoil in the UK, and why she is still confident about the UK. We'll bring you that exclusive interview next, and this is Bloomberg. отлич reviews. I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think David has been a change in how he was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4170,2022-10-18 08:17:44
15825," in the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel. That's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing. And it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. When US inflation numbers are released, the score is inflation one fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. Corsi Pion America 40 year high. The yields are absolutely flying. It could ease down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? We are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? The down shift just keeps getting pushed down. Now it looks like we're going into extra innate. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg, your global business authority. MUSIC We are a big lender in the UK. We are one of the top mortgage lenders and with a very low risk portfolio, 40% auto value. But clearly what is happening in the UK is affecting consumers, is affecting businesses. But I'd say the world is living through a period of, I'd say unprecedented economic stress, added by, you know, with the geopolitics and the national politics. What's really difficult at times like this for governments, but also for businesses is to get the balance right between what's urgent and important, which is fighting inflation, but at the same time, making sure we're laying the foundations for growth. And of course, fiscal policy has to be aligned with monetary policy. And I think that is the balance that was not right in the UK. That's what markets were telling us. And at the end, it's about, and I'm very pleased by the steps that have been taken. I think it's important to give stability and confidence as much as we can, not just to markets, but to consume us on businesses. You know, we are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think, you know, the steps taken are in the right direction. Well, that was the bank call center, the executive chair, Annabelle Tens speaking exclusively to Bloomberg about the turmoil in the UK. Now, we're back with Elise Bedouin, hella VMA, equity research at City. Elise, we talked extensively about the UK. You were giving me some of your sector calls, what you like and don't like. How do you break it down country by country in the rest of Europe? So in the rest of Europe, I think, you know, again, I mean, obviously in France, you've got a nice cluster of luxury goods companies. And, you know, we continue to expect strong growth there. We think that has derated. And that's probably a nice place to invest going forward, even for US investors, where, you know, that grows might offset some of the FX strands there. We continue to expect strands in healthcare and in telco, where we have stable earnings that are very, very good hedge against the GDP downgrades that we might see. Obviously, we are into earnings season, and we may see some bottom up, we may get some bottom up information. Investors in Europe have been, you know, overwhelmed with macro news, with obviously political turmoil. And meanwhile, you know, we have this bottom up, we have that bottom up information that will come up in the next few weeks. We believe, you know, we'll still see weakness for reencamping, in some of the industrial names, not all of them, and then utilities. So, it is, I don't know whether, I mean, I'm sure you're looking at the strikes in France, and I don't know whether that changes economic policy and then further down the road could actually change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4171,2022-10-18 08:20:38
15826," So, Elise, I don't know whether, I mean, I'm sure you're looking at strikes in France, and I don't know whether that changes economic policy and then further down the road could actually change your view, for example, on the front-check with ease. So, I think it's very important to not ignore certainly those disruptions. Essentially, when we look back in the last three years, we've seen massive shocks to our supply chains. The global financial crisis was a credit crisis, essentially. But this time around, all the troubles that we've seen, and there have been no release that have come from supply chain shocks effectively. So, the disruption that you highlight in France could bring some supply chain shocks again. France has been spared when you look at our GDP-focused city. We have some countries dipping into recession, but France actually is somewhat spared versus Germany, Italy and the UK. Clearly, you know, we'll be watching developments, you know, and the resurgence of, say, the Gilles Ghosn, or any form of disruption is something that we should watch. Is there anything out there in what you see for earnings that could make you change your view about what you've just beautifully laid out? And I think, you know, there's some positive scenarios as well. I mean, obviously, our global economists have put out a piece recently where we looked at a number of scenarios. Our best case is for essentially a couple of world economies dipping into recession, but not all at the same time, so not synchronized recession. I mean, we have a bear case where we all go synchronized recession. And we have a bull case, actually, where, you know, things could ease out. I think what could make ourselves change, obviously, any change in the war in Ukraine, because that's the investibility of the European sector from abroad and from flows that have pretty much halted, you know, and that would be a big change. So we're obviously watching geopolitical development with great interest. I would say that's the biggest change. And then any indication of when inflation may or may not peak. From a bottom of perspective, I would highlight the level of inventories and stocks. For example, our industrial analysts have recently very much highlighted the greater stocks and the lengths of stocks for industrial, which is actually helping producing good Q3.

15827," China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to NN0. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to itages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

I'm Curtis Weas considering the sale of its U.S. asset management business as a strategy revamp approaches. Meanwhile, Middle East sovereign wealth funds are said to be weighing whether to put money into the Swiss lender's investment bank. Let's get more from Bloomberg's Tom McAf. First of all, I mean how bad is the situation at Curtis Weasen? There are huge people, big rain makers leaving the bank, but we're not talking about solvency. No, it's not that extreme, but you can see how all in cumbersome this is just by the steady flow of news we see. Obviously, we've got this big strategy revamp announcement coming on October 27th, so late next week. What we're expecting is just a slew more of news come through as this sort of grip feeds out. Are we expecting them to break up the bank? Certainly we're hearing like basically it seems that so many options are under consideration. So yesterday we had the news that the U.S. asset management might be up for sale. You've heard Middle East investors sniffing around certain bits. Certainly seems that could be a possibility which sort of makes sense given the news in the last few months or even years, but it's almost unfathomable. Someone who knows credits with back in 20 pre financial crisis is extraordinary. Yeah, even four years ago. You wouldn't really expect back then to be here now. So it's really everything on the table of what they could do. I think that's the furthest assessment and we really interesting see how they sort of word this sort of announcement on October 27th. You know, for the last, how many quarters they've been trying to sort of steady the ship and I'm expecting sort of big fireworks, really big statements and sort of an idea that one big effort they'll sort of set out their plan and move on hopefully. What's valuable in the company? So is it the brand name, Interim Protein Asia? What's the best option? I think sort of the wealth unit is probably the sort of the most cherished part of the business right now, but you know, even the investment bank has gone through so many troubles. That is a story franchise, you know, it comes out of first Boston in the U.S. and you think there'll be some interest. There's still a lot of talent there, but of course the problem is it's all, it's like a trust business right now. As you say, big rain makers have been leaving. They're doing everything they can to try and keep talent and then yesterday we hear that Christine Messner, the head of the bank is off the world. At top, thanks so much. Bloomberg's up top that cap. Coming up, but Biden downplays recession risks. So we'll talk of course about the economy and the risk of inflation going up.

15828," Of course, about the economy and the risk of inflation going up this is Bloomberg. It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. If you know, and COVID has accelerated that, the industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall and estimates are a trillion dollars, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology, of which all the three companies can satisfy that need.

Well, good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition. I'm Fran Sinlac here in London. Bank of America reported a record net interest to income of 13.8 billion dollars in the third quarter as it reads the benefits of rising interest rates. Achieve executive Brian Moynihan told his consumers are still spending and he's seeing few signs of weakness or stress in the US economy. Are the consumer spending or they're doing things? They've got drives, the US economy as you well know. And so spending for the third quarter was 10% higher. It was last year's third quarter. The spending for the first couple weeks in October is 10% higher. It was last October for the first two weeks. Now, what we call...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4174,2022-10-18 08:32:48
15829," On higher it was last year's third quarter. The spending for the first couple weeks in October is 10% higher. It was last October for the first two weeks. Now what we told people is you're seeing it slow just to hair. So it was maybe 14%, 15% early in the year, 12% and now 10. Which is frankly what people are trying to do is get the spending down a little bit, get the inflation pressures down in the drag of the interest rates, but it's still strong. And then so that's one way to think about it. The other way to think about the consumers, did that money in our accounts to spend in a month of September. The account balances were flat or slightly over where they were in August. And that is multiples of where they were pre-pandemic. And they continue to hold their own. And you can see inside the cash flow in customers, not making any reflection on this is tough on certain customers. But even with customers have lower income levels, we can send cash flowing positive still. Ren increases can slow that down. Other things can happen. The core thing is as of the third quarter, they continue to cash flow. And it can have more money in their accounts than they did before the pandemic by multiples. And then you go to their credit quality. In a credit quality of Bank of America, in our consumer books, is very strong across the board. The payment, the linkancies are much lower than they were pre-pandemic. Much lower than they were in any average, five best year type period. And just they moved a little bit off the floor, but they're still much lower than they've been. So consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed. You can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit. And that's good news for America. But it also makes the Fed's jobs tough, because they're trying to slow down this American consumer, which is a very resilient thing. But just to make sure I understand it, and obviously you can't promise what's going to happen next year. I'm not asking you to do that. But a lot of economists are saying the reason consumer is so strong right now is because the balance sheet were so strong coming out of the pandemic. At this point, you don't see those balance sheets really turning down as we get into next year. We don't see it yet. And so if you look back two quarters ago, when we did the earnings call people like, oh, the consumers get knocked out of the game and they're spending their counts six months later, the money's still there. So I think people are over-inticipating future. We as our projections, Canada's ballot spot and the team and our research group, which is one of the best in the world, has the third quarter positive, the fourth quarter negative, the first quarter negative, the second quarter of 23 negative, the third quarter of 23 negative. I'll be at it at like a one to one and a half percent GDP annualized growth, very negative growth rate. So we are predicting a shallow economy. That's our core assumptions. And embedded in that, if you look at how we set our reserves, we have the assumption that we're going to have five and a half percent unemployment. I'm not sure it's going to happen, especially this quarter. We have it at 5%, but that's the conservators we built our balance sheet from an operating basis. But if you look at the consumers, there's not the signs that we see in our numbers or other people's numbers, quite frankly, it says they're slowing down yet or they're in stress yet. And that will have to be part of what happens in order for there to be a deep recession. Because if the consumers have money and this big consumer-driven economy, that's what keeps America strong. Brian, you've always taken great pride in the Bank of America Research Unit and how good they are. Let's assume their numbers are exactly right. It could be better, it could be worse, exactly right, three down quarters, five, five and a half percent unemployment. What does that do for your loan loss provisions? What kind of provisions do you have to make for that? Well, inherently, we're always discounting the future because the way the Cecil rules work, so-called, you look out for life alone. So, you build reserves and we built 400 million or so this quarter, which is building that scenario, which is 60 percent of the base case, which is the average of blue chip economists and 40 percent in the adverse case. When you blend that together, it implies those advocates have high inflation and have high unemployment in them and you blend it together. The core, what we did at the end of the third quarter, has 5 percent unemployment for the fourth quarter of 22 and more than like five and a half for next year, so it's very conservatively built. So your provisions will go up against that backdrop. At one point, you'll start to see the other side of it emerge and that's what has happened back in the family. We put up a lot of reserves and we took them back in once you saw that the impact of, because what the administration did and what Congress did and what the central banks did around the world, you actually mitigate the effects of the unemployment numbers. That won't happen in a standard recession. I would expect, but on the other hand, the consumers are going in much stronger shape than they did even in 2006-07 leading into the great financial crisis. That was the Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan speaking with our very David Weston. We're joined by Octavio Morensi, founder and chief executive officer of OPMAS. Octavio, great to speak to you today. Now, not all US banks are created equal. Why is my comron-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4175,2022-10-18 08:38:37
15830," We're joined by Octavia Morensi, founder and chief executive officer of OPMAS. Octavia, great to speak to you today. Now, not all US banks are created equal. Why is microamerica doing so well and why are we actually onto a third possible turnaround plan for Goldman Sachs? I guess if you look at this, the US banking landscape, those banks are a big foot in commercial lending and corporate banking and retail banking have done really well this quarter. I think they're really well-readable. The revenues are up a bit, profits are down a bit, but I think you can explain that way by basically saying these banks are squirreling away money in anticipation of some sort of downturn in anticipation of credit quality of worsting in the coming months and coming years. So, but we haven't seen any evidence of that yet. As Bill Moynihan pointed out, credit quality remains absolutely outstanding in selling. So, default rates, the link with the rates are very low. But these banks are pushing money away nevertheless. So, there was a big increase in revenues overall, sort of high single digits, 10% increase in revenues overall for banks like Bank of America and a bit of a decline in terms of overall profitability. If you look at sort of the investment banking side of the House, things look a bit worse there. So, if you'd less than banking activity itself has dried up, especially on equity's capital markets are basically disputed altogether and on the trading side a bit lackluster. Some improvements, some worse thing there. But so, David, give me a sense of what are your favorite banks right now? We also see, and I'm looking at some of the data released, for example, by the Fed, about how much of the consumer lending a lot of these banks have on their balance sheet. Well, I think the banks that look really good at the moment are JP Morgan, our Bank of America, amongst those sort of retailish banks, Citi Group to a certain extent as well. And then a bit weaker banks that Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo, Bear Mine, has a very large mortgage portfolio or a disproportionate large mortgage portfolio. And the real estate market is one of the suffering. So, you've seen a drying up in terms of demand for mortgages. That's hit Wells Fargo harder than the others, relatively speaking. So that one is looking a bit weak. And then you've got the two big investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who compared to those sort of more retailish banks are struggling a bit and are trying to find the way, particularly in a new investment banking landscape. So that's, I think, how things break down amongst the top five or six banks in the US. Octavia, what are the banks that will suffer the most going forward if we have a big cost of living crisis and if inflation soars by another two percentage points? Well, I think these big, the big sort of commercial banks, the big money center banks have benefited enormously from a big increase in their net interest margins. So they are getting more on their loans than the money they're lending out and they're not paying more yet for the deposits. So if you look at the balance sheets and income statements for these banks, their depositors are still willing to accept very, very low interest rates and basically nothing on their checking and saving accounts. As interest rates push further, these banks are going to be able to do that anymore. So short term interest rates have risen quite aggressively over the course of the past year. They're going to have to pay their deposit as more. So that's going to come down. So then we also start to potentially see more of a housing crisis actually start to develop and housing starts to look very, very bad indeed. It's already slowed down enormously. I think prices are going to come down. They're pretty hard on the housing sector in the US and that's going to hit those banks with big exposures there. So those are sort of storm clouds gathering on the horizon a bit. Octavia, talk to me a little bit about some of the European banks. So there's a lot of stress and a lot of concern about what Critty Sweets ends up being is everything on the table right now in terms of being split off, being sold, sovereign wealth funds may be coming in. Well, they're talking about selling off their US wealth management as a management business. They're talking about selling off some participations that they have in Switzerland, some sort of tangential kinds of things like this. They're staking the Swiss stock market in six and a few other sort of car processing companies there in Switzerland. They're still tinkering a bit of the edges, I think, but I think at this stage everything's on the table. This is a basically bank that has stumbled from one crisis to the next. There's been a bit of barricade to watch. And they're finally getting around to doing something quite dramatic about it. I will say about a year and a half ago, it looked like Critty Sweets had turned the corner. The things were looking pretty good and you said really the new CEO has turned things around and things were looking in a positive direction. And then basically the wheels fell off the wagon again at Critty Sweets and they're back sort of scandal-ridden as a stumbling from one crisis to another. So I think at this stage of course, we use everything's on the table, basically selling off parts of their core business, basically selling parts of their wealth management, their asset management, their investment banking, all of that sort. I think it's all on the table.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4176,2022-10-18 08:42:39
15831," This table of groceries, everything's on the table, basically selling off parts of their core business, basically selling parts of the wealth management, the asset management, the investment banking, all things of that sort. I think it's all on the table. We're gonna see this bag basically, get dismembered over the course of the next six to 12 months, I believe. Octavio, thanks so much for joining us. Octavio Morenzi, their founder and chief executive of OPMAS, joining us this morning on all things, US banks, but also Crowley Sweets. Coming up, the chief executive of Kurt Geiger tells us how the fashion brand is trying to maintain demand for storing inflation. This is Bluebird.. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. It was a tricycle empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in hustling, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. How did Jeff Bezos realize you could sell anything on the Internet? The web was growing at something like 2300% a year. The web was growing that fast. It's going to be big. Why did Bill Gates create control all the lead? Kind of become the poster child of hate. Couldn't you have made this stuff a little simpler? And what inspired Diane von Firstenberg to create the rap dress? The rap dress created me. On the David Rubenstein show, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders, who are here on Bloomberg. I think the key problem here is that disinflation is caused principally by supply side considerations, by supply forces. And that means you have to really hit the interest rate sensitive part of the economy very hard in order to realign aggregate supply and aggregate demand. So the cost is going to be much higher than you would typically see in a normal business cycle. And that's going to be the challenge. And until the market knows how the Fed is going to deal with this trade off, or how central banks generally are going to deal with it, I think the market remains on guard and remains unsettled. And what's been priced in, for more years seeing from asset classes right now, the prices we're seeing right now, because we have the likes of Montgomery as saying that, you know what, rates, Google as high as 9%. Well, you know, this is sort of the game that every week we seem to be pushing rate expectations higher. At the moment, I would say we're probably looking at a kind of priced in end rate of somewhere close to 5%. And to the extent that there is uncertainty on that, that's what keeps the market on its toes. And we said earlier that BlackRock sees market recovery longer than other economic downturns. Why is that number one, when might that be, when will we see butter, what might be the trigger? Yeah, the key reason is because this is this inflation is driven principally, as I said, by supply side forces. And that means that Fed just has to be, or all central banks have to be that much tougher, if they want to get inflation back to 2%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4177,2022-10-18 08:46:34
15832," driven principally, as I said, by supply side forces. And that means that Fed just has to be or all central banks have to be that much tougher if they want to get inflation back to 2%. It really means you need to crush the interest rate sensitive part of the economy if you want to realign this quickly and get back to 2%. And I think this is where the debate is. Is it worth the price of doing that to get inflation back to 2% or do you at some point have to say the cost is too high and you have to tolerate some inflation while you let the supply side heal? That's the question the Fed will face at some point early next year. And in the meantime, the dollar at 20 years highs and will remain elevated for quite some time, how long do you think that will be and where's the biggest pain that we'll see from that mighty dollar? Well, I think you, first of all, this is very hard for emerging markets. That's clear. It's going to be hard for the US economy. It's hard for the world economy as a whole. And the question comes as you tighten policy whenever we have a cycle. And remember, this is the most aggressive tightening cycle we've ever seen already at this stage. And that raises the question of what else appears of vulnerability points in the financial markets, in the financial sector. And as we've seen, LBI in the UK has been one flashpoint. And I think the market rightly worries, will there be others as we proceed on this very aggressive tightening cycle? There, with BlackRock, Vice Chair, Philip Hildebrand saying, markets will remain uncertain for quite some time, with the strong dollar also set to linger. Now, that strong dollar has benefited quite a few European retailers with American tourists taking advantage of the weekly pound. Well, Kurt Geiger is known for designers to let us. But the retailer has inflation hot on its heels. It's this custom company with the chief executive, Neil Clifford. Neil, thank you so much for joining us. Now, you were explaining to me something that I had, of course, seen in the research, but you kind of brought it home. That in last three years, you've been betting much more on the US. A stronger dollar must help a lot with that, when you bring the revenue back home. It does. I mean, yes, we adore America as a company. We've been there now five years. We were very lucky to recruit an amazing executive to help us with that expansion. And now we have more doors in America, more points of sale than in Europe and the UK. So 400 points of sale in America. So I mean, the US market is definitely the biggest retailing company in the world in terms of how was it consumed? Is that why you like America? Or do you think that US consumers spending will be stronger than here in Europe going forward? Well, we always knew that America would be a great expansion opportunity for us. And the keys really were recruiting a team to help us with that, to give us the confidence, frankly. And yes, America next year will be bigger for us than in the UK. So we're very fortunate that it's been a big success. I think 40% of your sales are still in the UK. How much of a mess is Great Britain right now? How much is... Sorry, what was the question? How much of a mess? I mean, I don't know whether you can find start in your shops. I don't know whether inflation is biting much harder than in other places. We are still growing. Our sales are up on last year, and our profits are well up on last year in the UK. Be it the market and the consumers under pressure. So I suppose it just makes us work harder. We're a culture of a company that looks in the mirror much more than out of the window. So it just motivates us to do a better job, frankly. But how do you do a better job, is it the better quality of products? Design, price, value. But price is... You need to bring it down or up. Well, maybe in some areas down slightly, but it's more about value than price. It's more about ensuring that we design things, we create things that are unique. I know that sounds a little obvious, but that's our job, really. No retailer has the right to survive or succeed or fail. It's up to us to be motivated to do a better job every day. But yes, the US, for sure, is a place where I'm there maybe one week every six now, and then next week, for example, looking for stall locations. So we're very positive about that part of our business. So, how much do you worry if you look at...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4178,2022-10-18 08:51:08
15833," Now, next week, for example, looking for stall locations. So we're very positive about that part of our business. So, how much do you worry if you look at the next four to five years? So you're not high end, you're not high street. You're kind of in that middle. Is that the income though that's going to be squeezed the most? Well, we'd like that white space, actually. We think that we offer extreme value for our creativity of our product. Our brand is a very joyous brand. It's full of color. It's quite unique, we believe. So we... There's always room for a shoe and a handbag, as long as it's wonderful. Actually, in America, business is almost 80% handbags. So we're not a shoe business now at all, frankly. That's where we came from. I joined in 96. I've been here many, many years. The sales were a tenth of the size. The profits were non-existent. Next year, we'll be 50 million in EBITDA. So the companies changed the law in 20 years. Is that also because of COVID, so that people dress less installettos and more in a fleasure, where more trainers that you're basically selling more handbags? Well, for example, our biggest category now is handbags of the business. And then boots and then sneakers, beard that heels are treble of last year. So people are going out more, of course. Through COVID, it was very difficult, the UK had a difficult time in COVID. So yes, we... As we talk about inflation, and we talk about also concerns about supply chains, you know, some of the things to be produced more quickly, takes a long time to ship them. Like, out of your... The operational things that you have to deal with, what's your biggest concern? I suppose looking after our factories, looking after our supply chain, and we were helping our suppliers paying earlier than we needed to do, just to ensure we had the right supply we delivered on time. So yes, I suppose it's looking after our relationships with our factories. That would be probably the number one point. And our distribution, you know, our four partners we have in America. Thank you so much for joining us. No, Clifford, they're the chief executive of Kurt Gagger. Now, coming up, but you've just heard the view from British High Street, we'll keep you up to date with the turmoil at the top of the British government. That's coming up shortly, and this is Boobert. I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs, I think, want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel.

Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. The leader of the House suggests that we should be grateful that the Prime Minister has made a difficult decision. I presume she means grateful that she's stuck to it. It's given the number of U-turns that we've seen over the last couple of days. But that's the job. Making difficult decisions. There are difficult decisions to be made about what is happening in Ukraine. The fact that President Putin has nuclear weapons, about the chaos caused by Brexit, gang crime, the climate crisis, Ebola, in Africa. All we know right now is unless she tells us otherwise that the Prime Minister is cowering under a desk and asking for it all to go away. Isn't it about time she did and let somebody else who can make decisions on the British National Interest get in charge instead? Yes, in the House. The Prime Minister is not under a desk as the Prime Minister is not here for a very good reason. But neither has she taken this decision to win the Honourable Lady's gratitude. She's done it out of a sense of duty because she knows what's in the national interest.

15835," For thisuffled Oğlum When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. People understand that if you're a longer term investor eventually the tide will turn. This cycle is being defined not by its severity but by its duration. I get it that we're probably not at the bottom and there's more stress to come, but things are starting to look pretty reasonable if you can take a longer time horizon. I have global interest rates, low equity prices and a stronger dollar. We think we'll continue into year end. We're going back to a normalization of rates and this is actually how the system should work. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early addition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong are top stories today. Wall Street's most vocal bull trims whisk stocks extend a rebound though.

15836," But suggests she won't step down. And to sell or not to sell, Credit Suisse is considering a sale of its US asset management business and may get interest from private equity firms, meanwhile Goldman is set to report results today ahead of its own reorganization. Welcome to Bimbeck's Availance Early Edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in New York, Kaley Lines, is off today and Matt fascinating rebound in markets yesterday and today. The Bank of America Fund Manager survey now says it finds full screaming capitulation. We seem to be trading like that in the short term, whether it lasts though. Yeah, I mean, I think they also say that a lot of the morsels they found in this survey mean the market is right for a bear market rally. So not that we've necessarily found a bottom completely because there's still policy capitulation to come according to Michael Hartnet. But there are reasons to think that the market could continue to rally in the short term. We have had gains across Asia. Most of this is due to really the UK getting its house in order. That's helped US stocks yesterday and Asian stocks overnight. And I think markets seem to have shrugged off the fact that China delayed some GDP data. So overlooking that for now, the Asia Pacific is up 1.25%. The Hang Sang is up 1.8%. And then in Australia, I just noticed not only a big rally in stocks, but also in bonds and that pushes the 10 year yield down under to 3, 9, 19. Take a look what's going on in US equities index futures, I should say, after the big rally that we had yesterday and we closed up very positive, more than 2% in the S and P. Now we're up 1% on futures this morning. And you have investors selling debt, the yield floating up over 4%. And I think you now go up above 4% all along the curve even out to 40 years. Times crude coming down 76 cents a barrel to 84, 77. So that's another tailwind there for equities today. And Bitcoin continues to stay at this range. Basically unchanged, no volatility in the cryptocurrency at 19,512. What do you see in Europe? Yeah. Well, what we see in Europe then Matt is a continuation of this strength. We saw on Wall Street yesterday 3% higher on the now set. Well, now we're higher here in Europe again because we were higher yesterday also. So some strength coming through the DAX up by 1.1%. We've just got an interesting data point to add into the mix. German October ZEW investor expectations. So this is around just what investors are feeling about the future. Minus 5.59.2. The estimate was for a more negative reading than that of minus 66. So at the margin, perhaps that also a positive sign that things not looking as bad from an investor expectation perspective. Just highlighting some of the strength coming through 1.4% higher on the FTSE MIM in Italy. And Telecom Italia part of that story, there's been talking the newspapers over in Italy about whether a bid might come through from private equity, for example. And that has pushed that particular share price around, although as you can see from its size, it doesn't take much to push that around these days. Let's have a look at some UK assets in the middle here then. We've got 30-year yields at 4.44%. And things looking a little bit calmer. We are seeing selling of UK long end debt today. But the movement isn't very large. The selling isn't extensive. And the movement in yields is not very large. And in fact, it's in good company. We're seeing those yields going up more in Germany and Italy and other parts of Europe. So it isn't a UK specific story today. Here's the pound, 112-98. It was up in the early part of the trading day because we had a report in other media in the UK, the FT reporting, that they thought that QT was going to be delayed. The Bank of England has just put out a statement, though, to say that that reporting is not accurate. And actually, there is nothing to see here, essentially. My words, not theirs. 1312 is where we trade, though, on the pound, and the pound now down by 4.10 of 1%. Let's stick with UK themes, though, Matt. The UK Prime Minister Liz Trance apologised for the chaos cause by her mini budget. But said she plans to lead the Tories into the next elections. She spoke on BBC yesterday. Now, I recognise we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes. But I fix the mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. And what I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We were elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. UK Prime Minister speaking there, saying she fixed the mistakes, of course, others, some in the market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4182,2022-10-18 09:08:34
15837," The UK Prime Minister speaking there, saying she fixed the mistakes, of course, others sum in the market, points to the risk premium attached to UK assets. Still, an ask continues to ask those questions. We're joining our Bible in based Lizzie Burton, who's with us from Westminster. So Lizzie has the new chance to legeremmy hunt done enough to stabilize the economic situation to shore up the Prime Minister's position. Well, he does seem to have reassured many in her party. It's hard to understate the scale of this reversal from Jeremy Hunt yesterday. He's managed to plug £32 billion of the £70 billion gap in the fiscal fight in the finances. He has removed some of the stimulus, which means that the Treasury and the Bank of England don't need to be in such a tug of war. And of course, the Bank of England, as you say, saying that the FT was wrong to report that it's planning to delay quantitative tightening. But on the other hand, without the sugar rush, the recession risks are heightened. And no matter what Hunt did, he couldn't take away the more on-risk premium as T.S. Lombard puts it. The higher borrowing costs brought about because of the damage to the UK's economic credibility that Truss has already managed to inflict. So one guest on Bloomberg TV yesterday defined Huntonomics as soon economics on steroids. He's going to have to be more fiscally disciplined, introduce spending cuts. But it's difficult politically because Labour has already dubbed it austerity 2.0. A more on-risk premium. I just want to be sure that I heard you corrected. That was the phrase, a more on-risk premium. The Prime Minister seems to be hanging by a thread here. Clearly, I think there's one live stream that's looking to see if she can outlast a head of cabbage. Are there any realistic contenders to replace her, though? I believe it's a lettuce and that lettuce was moved under a desk yesterday because Penny Morden had to confirm that Liz Truss was not in fact hiding under a desk yesterday when she was absent from the Commons and Morden was sent into back instead of Truss in response to an urgent question from the leader of the opposition. Yesterday it seemed like Truss's cabinet was auditioning for the top job. If you had Morden, then you had Jerry Hunts various outings throughout the day. We didn't see Rishi Sunak. He's been conspicuously absent for the past few weeks, perhaps trying not to get that backstab a tag that he had last time during Boris Johnson's downfall. But whoever MPs would unite behind to anoint as leader, they would face the challenge of a diluted mandate. The need to go to the public for a general election and no Tory wants that. While the Labour Party has a 25 year record poll lead, so it's not a place that most in the party want to go. Lizzie, thanks very much. Bloomberg's Lizzie burdened their reporting on the current state of the UK in terms of economics and politics. Let's get back to markets. J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs offer words of caution to investors. Goldman prefers Chinese stocks over their US peers. The bank says investors should sell S&P 500 calls and fund with those proceeds the purchase of the same options on the Hang Seng. Bloomberg markets editor Valerie Tytel joins us for more. Thanks, Matt. And again, on that Goldman note, not only are they barriced on US stocks, but they're willing to sell S&P upside to fund China H. Share calls. As we know, China stocks have been a dismal performer this year since COVID. They're down nearly 50 percent that aligns with the S&P's move of nearly 14 percent since the start of COVID. But look, it's not just Goldman trimming their bullish equity views. You also have the fame bull over at J.P. Morgan, Colonyvich trimming his allocation to equities. But I'll leave you to with this. In the Bank of America Fund Manager survey, it showed a 6.2 allocation into cash. That is a 20-year high, Anna and Matt. That's a huge number. Also, 45, nearly 50 percent of the respondents said they're underweight equities. Now, you could argue that this means we're right for a risk asset bounce. I think the question now is, is that into the end of this year? Are we looking at the first half of 2020?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4183,2022-10-18 09:12:37
15838," Now you could argue that this means we're right for risk asset bounce. I think the question now is, is that into, is that into the end of this year? Are we looking at the first half of 2023? Yeah, they talk about the last set. Don't they will see whether this turns out to be sustained. This bounce we're seeing now then, Valerie or a bear market hug then. Bloomberg's Valerie title. Thank you very much. And you can see Valerie's charts and all of the terminal analysis via GTV go on the Bloomberg terminal mat. All right, in banking news, Credit Suisse is considering a sale of its US asset management business. This comes as the firm nearest a strategy revamped that's likely to reshape the entire operation and those who run it. Shnalli Bassic, our global finance correspondent joins us now for the details. So we continue to follow the Credit Suisse saga and now they've got assets on the block. They sure do. They have the asset management business in the United States as one of those parts. They have the investment bank that they are scouting interest across the globe as we've reported funds tied to Abidawi and Saudi Arabia are among those considering an investment in any sort of investment bank deal. And of course that investment bank CEO, Christian Meissner is exiting. We have reported that that would happen. Now we know that it will be announced at the investor update on October 27th. The question is, how much can they give investors an update of all these other deals that hopefully will stay off a deludive capital raise? And Shnalli, what about the Goldman earnings? We expect numbers shortly and we've had no shortage of things to talk about when it comes to Goldman and the company. Is it interesting, Shnalli, do you find that the British talk about investment banks in terms of like, I don't know, plural or possess it. Goldman's war against. I was wondering where you were going to go with this. Anyways, speaking of reorganization, so we, in addition to Goldman's earnings, where I've got to say the expectations are quite low. The expectation is a return on equity of 10% that would be less than what Morgan Stanley had printed. And in addition to that, it's that big reorganization that has been reported throughout yesterday that investors will want clarity to. Is this merely reorganization? Is it a realigning of deputies or is it a full scale change in the way that Goldman sees some of their more moonshot projects that they have been working on the last several years? Of course, they've been punching above their weight when it comes to their core businesses, markets and advisory investment banking. But what of the consumer bank and what of the wealth manager as the whole market is really looking at wealth management to really be the ballast to a lot of these businesses that are facing a lot of pressure? Okay, whatever we call it, the focus of the numbers and the restructuring. Sean Ali, thanks so much, being very Sean Ali, Basek and we'll have more on the bank earnings story, of course, later this hour. Timothy Morgan joins us, KBW, US financials specialist, great to get his perspective. Also coming up on the program, Simon, friends, Chief Economist at Panwheel Gordon, it seems that we are seeing markets rethink quantitative tightening and tighter policy. And that's having an impact on UK assets this morning. So we'll come back to that theme. Plus the rise and fall of the COVID-19 billionaires from Zoom to Moderna, some pandemic fortunes are beginning to crumble, as fast as they saw.

15839," at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryott's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell, who is the CEO of the CFOs, is the CEO of the CFOs. He's the CEO of the CFOs. He's the CEO of the CFOs.

We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. Tomorrow, St. Louis Fent President James Bullard sits down for an exclusive interview with Bloomberg's Kathleen Hayes. Will he offer any hand of an ease in the coming months? Find out tomorrow on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance. The early edition, we are simulcast on both radio and television. I will point out that I'm looking at a chart right here. Those of you listening on radio, clearly can't see it. But I recommend checking it out when you get the chance. You can just type GTV Go for all of the charts that we use on this program. And this one is a great picture of the incredible chaos that we've seen in the guilt market. With yield rising all the way up past 5%, and then dropping well below 4%. Right now we're at 442. But the question is, what will the UK government do next? Next, as we were just talking about, there's a bit of a moron risk premium. They're joining us now as Priscilla, Asaveto Rocha, Bloomberg credit reporter, to talk about how this has affected markets. And it isn't even just local, right? The UK guilt market or the chaos in it has really spread around the world to royal all, certainly equity markets around the world. Priscilla. Yeah, that's right, Matt. We've seen like some moments of stability coming through this week and after the new chancellor announced it's the reversal of the government's fiscal policies, sentiment was improving. But the bigger backdrop still remained very, very much negative. And now with the news that the Bank of England will not pursue with the quantitative tightening, we need to see how markets will react to that and we're in for more volatility. Okay, yes, we've seen markets reacting in a little. We've seen, we saw a bit of a reaction in bond markets, didn't we? But now we should say yields, yes, they're rising across the UK, but not even as much as Spanish, it's alien and French yields. So they're sort of in good company, more in lockstep with the rest of Europe today, which makes a change. But we have seen the FTSE 250 raising its gains as a result of those B-O-E comments. On another, more stock-specific or company-specific, kept front, what's the credit angle on credit suites at the moment, Priscilla? Because that seems to be something that we're following very closely. Yeah, that's right. So we're all watching the CDS for credit suites to see how this is going to react because of course stocks have fallen. They're continuing to follow. There is still a lot of uncertainty in the air and who's going to be like? Who's going to bid for the bank in water the next steps? We're still, of course, a few weeks from the official announcement, but we're watching what are going to be the next steps in what are like the main bond holders and the credit holders of the bank reacting to this. In terms of Europe, how much volatility do you see there from what we see in the UK? I mean, interestingly enough, it doesn't seem like the ECB or European policy makers have made as many missteps. Yes, that's right. There's some volatility in Europe, but things seem to be more contained when compared to the UK. People, of course, they're watching Italy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4185,2022-10-18 09:21:28
15840," Yes, that's right. There's some volatility in Europe, but things seem to be more contained when compared to the UK. People, of course, they're watching Italy, they're watching other bond markets to see how they're going to react to the news now coming from the UK. But there is fear of contagion, especially in governments like Italy, Spain, France. Yeah, absolutely. You can feel of contagion, feel of inter-countries, in particular ones that have ongoing concerns around deaths. Some slightly brighter news, and I've talked about this in recent days, the rate at which we're seeing gas prices come down, Priscilla, is this something we maybe need to keep in focus? 117 euros per megawatt hour means probably nothing to anybody, but it is a lot less than 350, which is where we got to at the height of this crisis. This is something, as the weather continues to be not too cold here in Europe right now. This is something to watch. Yes, this is absolutely something to watch, because governments now, they have been focusing on gas storage ahead of winter, on raising money to source gas. There's a lot of news this morning from now in the market looking to raise credit facility for energy, ENBW is also looking at private debt markets. There's a lot of concern on how they're going to fund and how they're going to raise money throughout winter. With gas prices like a little bit lower, this, of course, gives them some room to breathe. Okay, Priscilla, thank you very much. Thanks for joining us.

We want to make sure that people understand, especially in Wyoming, but as the United States as a whole, this trend is coming. It's not going to stop. This is more of a small town that's growing into what I would call the cryptocurrency version of Silicon Valley.

15841," Balance of power with David Wester, views and analysis inside, from and above politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Hello, I'm Emma Barnett, and I'm a journalist and presenter. This is my new shirt. Emma Barnett meets. First, I'll be meeting Chinese artist and dissident by way of way. And I'll talk to the novelist and political scientist, Elise Schaffert. Tune in to watch those who shape our world, explain how the world shapes us. This is Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quickshake. This is Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm Matt Miller in the York with Anna Edwards in London. Kaley Lines is off today. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word slogans attacking President Xi Jinping, featured on banners on a Beijing bridge last week, have spread to other cities in China, as well as across the globe. Braises from the original handwritten banners have criticized strict lockdowns and restrictions that have defined she's COVID-0 policy and called for new elections. German Chancellor Olaf Schultz has ordered an extension of the lives of the country's three remaining nuclear plants until April 2023. The decision is meant to end a standoff between two coalition partners. The Greens are opposed to nuclear power, but the free Democrats argue Germany should use all the generation capacity available to tackle the energy crisis. And President Biden's political travel schedule is lighter than his immediate predecessors at the same point in the midterm campaign. It's a challenge on popular president's face and trying to stave off congressional losses during the same week in their first midterm campaigns in 2018 and 2010. Former president Trump and Obama traveled to three and four states respectively for political events. Chip delivery times, shrank by four days in September. The biggest drop in years, it's a sign that the industry's supply crunch is easing. Lead times, which is the gap between when a chip is ordered and when it's actually delivered, average 26.3 weeks in the period, according to Susquehanna Financial Group, down from nearly 27 weeks in the prior month. And you know, the one thing that I think is a little bit confusing and in terms of the chip story is that certain industries are still finding it very difficult to get chips, or more difficult and usual, for example, the automotive industry is not getting enough chips to produce all of the cars that they could sell. Still, at the same time, PC companies are swimming in chips and no one is buying too many PCs for the chip supply. So chip makers that produce those kinds of chips are having to report losses in profit as the chip makers that produce automotive chips are having to ramp up capacity. Yeah, as we talked about in earnings season after earnings season, it seems, since the height of the COVID pandemic, Matt, not all these chips are created equal. They don't all go to the same end use, obviously, and different chips have different lead times. It would appear. What is interesting about the story, though, and it also makes the point that the lead time is coming down, the waiting time is coming down. But of course, this is a sector now facing other challenges. Geopolitics, very much in the mix here, as we've seen President Biden taking measures to restrict the ability of US producers to export to China, for example. Yeah, absolutely. And it still has to be seen how that's going to play out because it doesn't seem like businesses are shining away at all from getting equipment or technology produced in China or Taiwan. Yeah, coming up on the program, Simon French joins us. Chief Economist, Pam Eurgordan, we will get his take on what the latest volatility in guilt markets has meant for the trajectory of QT. We'll get into that conversation. This is Blaineback.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4187,2022-10-18 09:29:44
15842," Color Beautiful Today, what are the biggest challenges for general dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element. I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost-effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. This is Moonbeck's Evidence Early Edition. Here's what you need to know. Wall Street's most vocal ball trims risk stocks extend though a rebound as JP Morgan's Marco Kalanovich grows cautious. But Bank of America says it's fund-manager service screams capitulation. Crisis management mistrust apologises for the chaos caused by her mini budget but suggested she won't step down. And to sell or not to sell, Credit Suisse is considering a sale of its US asset management business and may get interest from private equity firms. Meanwhile, Goldman is set to report results today ahead of its own reorganisation. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller in New York. Kaley Lines is off today. We seem to see some really exuberance, maybe the temporary bear market rally who knows about in stocks but something has got markets excited yesterday and today a bit of a turn around from the negative to Friday. But maybe some of that exuberance is just waning in the wake of some of those lines in the Bank of England half an hour ago. Yeah, although it's not irrational, doesn't seem irrational. If you look at the Bank of America survey, screaming capitulation, 6.3% cash that's the most investors have held since April of 2000 and 1 actually. So as Valerie pointed out, it's been 20 years since we've seen those kind of cash levels. The S&P 500, S&P futures I should say, the E-mini contract right now, more than 1% after the S&P 500, the cash trade closed yesterday over 2%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4188,2022-10-18 09:34:55
15843," 500 S&P futures I should say, the E-mini contract right now, up more than 1% after the S&P 500, the cash trade closed yesterday over 2% gain. Investors are feeling comfortable enough to sell off debt. The 10 year yield is up over 4%. Right now, four spot 0, 2, 3, 1% and I double checked across the curve. From 2 to 30s, you're getting more than 4% returns on the US 10 year. This is actually one of the headwinds in a sense now. Investors feel comfortable enough to let go of the debt. But as this yield gets even higher, it poses a challenge, a little bit of competition to stocks. Investors always comparing stocks and bonds, of course. Now, I'm x-crewed off 48 cents right now, a barrel to 84, 98. So coming down a little bit, maybe not panic level. So we're not worried about the bottom falling out demand, certainly not here in the US. And we do still have really elevated fuel prices relative to what we have previously, not relative to what you have. I filled up this morning for over $5 a gallon. Bitcoin right now at $19,554. So holding incredibly steady, absolutely no volatility in the OG cryptocurrency as there is in pretty much every other asset class, which is like opposite world in the sense. Anna, what are you seeing in Europe? Yeah, it is certainly not what maybe we'd expect it. Not what we saw at the beginning of the tightening cycle from the Fed either. Let's have a look at what we've got in Europe, they've got a deep dive into UK assets. But here, starting with the pan-European picture, up by 4.1% on the stocks at $600. Have we seen then capitulation as you've referenced that Bank of America investor survey? Interesting. We'll talk about that in a moment. Here's what we've got on the UK front, though. And interesting to see that earlier on today, we saw a rally in the pound. It's currently at $1,13.41 and a little bit weaker. We saw a rally in the pound on that FD report that suggested that the Bank of England might be about to delay some of its quantitative tightening. We heard from them yesterday they were going to be selling corporate debt. But what were they going to do with the government guilt that they'd planned to sell? There was this report that suggested they delayed that. The Bank of England has come out and said that that report is not accurate. And so the pound has lost a bit of ground. 1,13,11 as I say. The interesting that the UK 30-year yield has sort of fallen in with the mix of European government debt markets today. And that's no bad thing. And that's more than can be said for the past couple of weeks. So that's interesting. 4.45 is the yield on the 30-year right now. And the FTZ250, I put this in, because we did see a real strength to the FTZ250. But as we got that comment from the Bank of England that no QT is not going to be delayed, there wasn't accuracy in that report that then we saw the FTZ250 coming off those recent highs. So it was up by more than 1% earlier on today. And it lost some ground as a result of that report, Matt. Yeah, it looks like there could be a little bit of a contrarian indicator there. Because the Bank of England is sticking to its plan. Or at least that's what it says, and that's what it did last week as well. The UK's reversal on tax cutting plans, probably helping them to do that, positive for investment as well. As you can see, really, from the rally and stocks around the world after that kicked off over the weekend. Also, according to bank notes, Santander, executive chair, and a boutine, she spoke exclusively with Bloomberg's David Weston. We are a big investor in the UK. I have high confidence in the strong institutions of the country. It's a very attractive place to do business, attract talent from all over the world. So I think the steps taken are in the right direction. Let's get over to Simon French right now, Chief Economist at Panier Gordon. Simon, what do you think of the U-turn that we've seen and how much more needs to be done in the UK? Well, I'd agree with Annabotan that there is a positive sentiment around in the last 24, 48 hours as a result of this U-turn from the government. I mean, a lot of investors will be perhaps looking on at the UK, particularly international investors, and going, OK, so tax cuts have been reversed. How is it a more attractive environment for business investment? But the reality is the business investment seeks, it craves, a stable macroeconomic framework. I'm afraid against the environment of four chancellors in four months. It was quite difficult to argue that the UK for all the strength of its institutions has a stable macroeconomic framework. There have been signs in the last 48 hours that that journey back...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4189,2022-10-18 09:39:03
15844," to argue that the UK for all the strength of its institutions has a stable macroeconomic framework, there have been signs in the last 48 hours that that journey back towards credibility and stability have begun, but it's going to be a long road. A long road, credibility quickly lost and takes a long time to rebuild is the way that many describe it to us. As the markets have flexed their muscles around this then Simon, what kind of broader messages do we take away about the ability of governments to stimulate with fiscal policy when times get tough if they do in forthcoming recessions? I think the lesson we take away from this is that you have to prime the market in terms of what your plans are. I think that was a failing of the UK government over the course of the summer, but you also need to read the macroeconomic room and if we look at the macroeconomic mix that the government is trying to pursue, lose fiscal, tight monetary policy, you could very well argue that global events, I would argue, the global events, the war in Ukraine and the impact in energy markets leading to significant fiscal bailouts, plus the tightening led by the Federal Reserve having to lean into a demand surge in the United States was doing that fiscal pivot anyway. That's what I mean by reading the room. The experienced economists in the UK have said all summer to the government, this pivot is taking place anyway, it's a very noble argument for a different macroeconomic mix to the one we've seen in the last decade or so, but if it's happening already, is the market going to think that you're adding fuel to a fire that is already burning? I think that was the interpretation and the interpretation that other governments around the world should take from this. And do we focus then on other places with relatively high debt levels? Do we focus on southern European countries or specifically Italy perhaps and think about fiscal policy because actually the new government there has been at pains to talk about fiscal discipline? Yes, although there is an obsession to look at debt to GDP ratios as if, like, instructive of how much headroom there is, but I think that sits in a second order level of indicators, institutional credibility, the messaging, the being able to present the fact that additional, like any CFO of a PLC around the world, they're going to make an argument to go back to debt markets to ask for more debt. You need to credibly make the case and if that is credibly made the case to your to your lenders, then they will forge you additional credit lines. In that respect, government credibility, the plans, perhaps Trump, the underlying metrics we may be used to in terms of net debt to EBITDA or in the government's case debt to GDP. Let me just get away from the UK and the West, really, as we continue to watch Xi Jinping in this party meeting here, GDP figures were delayed. It doesn't seem to have bothered the markets one bit and we had an interesting call out this morning from Goldman's saying that investors should sell calls on the S&P 500 and use the proceeds to buy the same in Hong Kong. What do you think of the Chinese economy right now as we continue to see lockdowns and concerns about them? Well, I think as an economy that has contributed about 40% of global GDP growth over the course of the last 15 years, there is a very clear slowdown both underway but also now structurally being added to by some pretty hawkish approaches to trade from the US. Now, part of that will be the understandable rhetoric and indeed action saw to head of the midterms politically will pull well. But I think you are starting to see now quite deeply held concerns that the impact of a slowdown in China makes some of the E parts, earnings parts of S&P indicators, global equity indices around the world not really believable in terms of their 2013 numbers and therefore we're entering a downgrade cycle. The debate among security strategists is how significant that downgrade cycle is and you mentioned at the very top of this segment the rising bond yields. That's spread now between the risk free rate and the potential earnings yield on the S&P makes",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4190,2022-10-18 09:42:54
15845, Free rate and the potential earnings yield on the S&P makes that equity risk premium look very low by historical standards and I think it's not unrealistic to see a further drawdown of maybe 20 to 25% to try and reestablish those historical norms of the equity risk premium. Simon thank you very much thanks for joining us good to get your perspective today. Simon French of Pan Mure Gordon coming up on the program we'll get back to the bank in a new story. Timothy Morgan joins us KVW US financial specialist one of the messages taken away so far from the bank earnings season and we'll look at the numbers from Goldman Sachs this is Linda. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we used to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful long lasting and affordable but all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to a increasingly renewable power driven grid we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather and other intermittances that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

To grow your practice and make better use of your valuable time. The differences Bloomberg Law. The credit quality in a credit quality bank of America in our consumer books is very strong across the board. The payment delinquencies are much lower than where a pay pandemic much lower than where in any average five best-year type period and just they moved a little bit off the floor but they're still much lower than they've been so consumers are spending they have money they're employed you can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit. Brian Moynihan there the CEO of Bank of America speaking with Bloomberg yesterday after the bank reported third quarter results the BTex expectations let's talk about the sex system with Immogun US financial specialist at KW joins us now here in London. It's been really nice to speak to you. Let's start with the point there we've been made by Moynihan about delinquencies yes they are but they are less than they were pre-pandemic. This is still a journey backs where we started I suppose through you know back through all of the unwinding of the large savings pool that people built up during the pandemic. What did you take away from that from that consumer sorry? Thanks Anna and thanks for having us on today. The bottom line is really simple we still are at essentially very far from recessionary type numbers we've seen some very small increases in credit problems from the subprime customer group in the US but by and large the banks are out of that business and are focused on prime and commercial customers and there's just been no sign of it yet so as Brian said on his conference call I mean there are some signs of credit deterioration but for starters they're tiny and secondly most of what the banks are seeing right now.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4191,2022-10-18 09:46:57
15846," and there's just been no sign of it yet. So as Brian said on his conference call, I mean, there are some signs of credit deterioration, but for starters, they're tiny. And secondly, most of what the banks are seeing right now, they would just call normalization after, as you've said, an amazing period of credit stability through COVID. We've seen an uptake, an uptake, I should say, in credit card usage, I think 13%. I don't know how much of that is down to inflation, but it always concerns me when consumers are putting more purchases on credit. Is that concern misplaced? That's a good question, Matt. I mean, historically, when consumer credit gets hot in the US, it can be a sign of the end of a strong cycle. But you have to remember that consumer credit fell off of a cliff in COVID. We actually went to 0% growth in credit card usage for a period. And actually, the recovery that we've seen in credit card growth is simply on track to take us back to the spending levels that we would have expected if you extrapolated from 2019 to the end of this year, growing at about 4%. So yeah, the numbers have been eye popping currently, but I think we could still call it mostly a catch-up effect. We also heard, I guess, to the positive side for consumers or at least bank account holders that their accounts were still excessive compared to what they were pre-pandemic in a good way, not excessive in the bad way, obviously. Is that representative you think of the average American or are the people with deposits at Bank of America at a higher income level? That's a good question, Matt. And honestly, I don't have a strong answer to that. I mean, as you appreciate, we have different consumer groups. And the banks do tend to focus less on subprime now where we know it's paycheck to paycheck every month. I mean, we did get a good breakout of deposits by Bank of America, and they showed that we're still well ahead of the 2019 levels for practically every savings group. So that's not by income group, but by deposit savings levels, sort of under 2 grand, 2 to 10 and over 10. So going into this earnings season, it seemed as if, given what was happening on net interest income or expected to happen on net interest income with higher rates, that maybe it would be main street banks that would do well and Wall Street banks less. So maybe that is true with investment banking under pressure. But some areas of FIC with trading activity have been quite resilient. So what's been the contrast for you? Oh, well, I mean, those are the two great stories for this quarter. I mean, that interest in comes up more than 20%. And we're expecting it to stay like that for a few more quarters, although with declining impact. So it's an aside issue, but we do have investors wondering about whether we're at peak net interest margins and peak net interest income. FIC, of course, has benefited from all of all utility and what it stands for, fixed income commodities and currencies, which, of course, have been void by all the other news you guys write about. In the meantime, equities and the investment banking business on the other hand, however, have been dealing with practically shut markets. Yes. I mean, on that theory about whether we've reached peak net interest margin, is that based on expectations of how far the Fed can push things before an economy starts to roll over? Or what is that debate encompassing? It's simply what you've just said. I mean, the Fed's expected by most people, consensus, and us to stop hiking as we get into the first quarter of next year. So the tailwind behind the banks of rising interest rates is at least at this stage expected to stop. And then what happens after that is what their paying depositors starts to catch up after that. And so net interest margins start to shrink, even if interest rates stay flat. OK. Thanks so much, Tim. Really good to speak to you.

When you think space you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESO, which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. The ESO wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. And ESO help humanity take its next giant leap. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but Link. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. I'm going to look at what's coming up for the rest of the week. Can the Alex, where? Correspondent for Bloomberg, Quick Take, always here when we want to talk things tech related and this sort of qualifies. Alex, what's going to be the headline? It's going to be all about subscriber growth, is it? After what happened the last time? Well, two things. Firstly, yes, subscriber growth in the first six months of this year, they lost two million subscribers in the US. They're saying globally the market's looking for a million new subscribers. There's also going to be a lot of attention on the comments to do with the ads tear. They're introducing an ad support to tear, which will be cheaper at the point of entry, but will obviously be subsidized, therefore buy ads, any commentary on what that will mean for their earnings will be pay close attention to. So I think that's really fascinating because I don't know what the story is in the, in the pound, land of pounds and euros, but here in dollar territory, it means a $15 a month payment compared to a $7 a month payment. So less than half, and I'm wondering, Alex, is this going to be, you know, existing subscribers like me shifting down? Roblox. Video on,.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4193,2022-10-18 09:56:42
15848," $1 a month payment. So less than half. And I'm wondering, Alex, is this going to be, you know, existing subscribers like me shifting down? Will it cannibalize their, you know, bigger spend clients or is it bringing in new people who thought, you know, previously 15 is too much. I'm not paying that, but I will pay seven. So there are two pieces to it. Yes, it's about reducing churn existing subscribers who go, I don't want to pay that. I want to go to a lower tier, but also trying to attract people who otherwise wouldn't afford it. And I don't think we need to look at the $15 tier so much as the $9 tier. There is a $9 tier, which is their basic level where you only get to play it on one device at any time. The thing is they could actually quite quickly end up making more money from those subscribers than they could from the $9 they currently do. Because if it's $7 and they're able to do the same as what Hulu does, which is $6.50 and add revenue per month per subscriber, you're very quickly at $13.50, which is more than their basic level tier is right now. It also means they can tell investors there's a lot more upside. If we look at say Facebook, which is consistently managed to grow average revenue per user, because ultimately, as long as you've got people's attention, it's easier to attract advertisers. So it helps reinvigorate the growth story, perhaps both in terms of subscriber numbers and the revenue get from each subscriber. Okay, and whether it costs $15 or $7 or $9, depending on how many households are jumping on that same password, it has an impact, doesn't it, on their subscribers. So what are we going to hear about cracking down on password sharing? Because this has been an issue. Yeah, so there's something they've been trialing in Latin America trying to ensure that people don't share their passwords as readily as they have done in the past. Anything there up to say on how effective that has been, and actually how they're going to model this sort of thing. I think this suspicion is that it'll be, for example, if you go on holiday and you're using something from a different IP address for say two weeks, that's kind of fine. But anything after that, then they start to ask questions and correct that. And they have the technology to sort of track whether people are using on quote unquote too many devices or doing too many locations. I mean, you have an IP address, which clearly should let you do that. One does, you know, some people use a VPN from the, if say you're in the UK, they might try to use VPN to watch Netflix in the US to get access to different things, but interesting to see the implications for some of that. I frankly, I think that a lot of it is playing around the edges. The more significant thing is very much the outspotted tier. Yeah, okay, Alex. Thanks so much. Alex, we're joining us there from Bloomberg and Quick Take. I'm sure all of these things, closely going to be watched by Matt Miller as we head towards those Netflix numbers due after trading today. Yeah, no, very much looking forward to it as we get really into the heart of earning season. You know, we had kicked off last week with the big banks and everything looks like it's going so well yesterday. Certainly Bank America didn't hurt the outlook. So Goldman Sachs is going to be huge into today's earnings, but Netflix as well. I mean, these big fang stocks, these big tech stocks really have been leading, or at least yesterday, led the rally. So we'll see if they can continue to pull us higher today. And I thought your question to Tim was really interesting around just how representative is the messaging we're getting from these banks of the average consumer in the United States. Because we're certainly not hearing that the consumer is in a terrible place and they're very ready for gearing up for a recession. That's certainly not the vibe we've got from the Bank earnings story. No, it sounds like the consumer is in the great place, at least when you listen to Moynihan, their credit is good, their accounts are elevated, and they're using more credit. But on the other hand, you have people upgrading Walmart and Target because the consumer is supposed to be switching down. Yeah, okay, lots more to come then. That's it for early additions. surveillance continues. Tom John and Lisa will be back with you. They'll be hearing from amongst others, Kit Chewkes at Saltjian.

15849," plusieurs. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists, because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. As part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression, I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we'd had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. I think that 3200 baht, if 35 doesn't hold, I think 3200 is the next natural place to go. I get it that we're probably not at the bottom and there's more stress to come, but things are starting to look pretty reasonable if you can take a longer time horizon. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City for our audience worldwide, good morning, good morning, this is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keane and Lisa Bramberts, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Futures up up and away again on the S&P 500 up by 1.29% TK Goldman, coming up a little bit later. Yeah, go ahead and come up a little later. It's going to be interesting after the generally good news we saw that John, it's finally a quieter tape. Yeah, lift inequities and that and you say, why? And I'm going to one person be Moynihan and that is the comfort here and you wonder, do we get the same surprise from a boolean-gird Solomon like Moynihan? He's going to say, I'm sorry, businesses and all that bad. Let's sit on Bank of America and talk about the other consumer banks as well, Tom. So Brian Moynihan, a bank of America coming out and saying, consumers are spending. They have money, they're employed, they have good credit. That was echoed by JB Diamond, a JP Morgan as well. Consumers are in very good shape. You had Jane Fraser over at City, the US economy remains relatively resilient. We know all those things about the US economy in the third quarter. Can you say those same things in about six months time? That's always the worry. And you get to go to the conference calls and it's dreaded forward guidance from the corporate. So as Gina Martin Adams is really good at this at Bloomberg Intelligence and she says, yes, there's a weight to looking out further now like there wasn't a year ago. Early days in any season, Bram, but are we skipping over a very low bar for the third quarter? A lot of people say that and we're not even skipping over that much.

15850," A year ago, early days in any season, Bram, but are we skipping over a very low bar for the third quarter? A lot of people say that, and we're not even skipping over that much. And when you don't skip over it, you get punished pretty badly. It's hard to come away with any kind of conclusive narrative with some of the trading activity, especially when you have, thank the America reports, talking about embrace the bear, but prepare for the bull, and all of these sort of metaphors that are, or, you know, but is it, how to be a more comfortable bear? Embrace the bear, but don't get kicked by the bull. What's this therapy? This is, I mean, this is therapy for people who are looking at a rally that's going to rip their faces off because it doesn't make any sense. But it's the mean thing. Are we all vulnerable this morning? I think it sounds like this. I feel so vulnerable. Okay, give me some more tang. Okay, I'll just like... This sounds like South Side therapy. I just, I sat down on Friday doing Bloomberg Rulio, and I turned around to the guest, and I said, I feel like this should be just a 30-minute show of market therapy. It's about losses. It gets through the week. Let's jump, let's just do this. You know, the bear market done 15% on 18%. The bond market, I'm sorry, is we open the show today. It's a quieter day. We need to look at negative 20, negative 30. I looked at 1 ETF bond fund down 34%. John, that's a bear market, and that's where you need therapy. I've heard a lot about scope for a bear market rally. We heard that from Hartner over a BFA this morning. No cuts, no glory. It's what he has to say, though. Ultimately, you've got the ingredients, perhaps, a recipe to get a bear market rally, but the lows for the team at BFA and that fund manager survey, not until the first half of next year. And it's exactly because of what you just said. It's not about jumping over a low bar for this earning season. It's about what happens next. And what's the guidance going to really give us if you have no guidance into next week, other than evidently Mike Wilson, he has a crystal ball. Nobody else seems to. He seems to have some insight. Nobody else has TK. Mike Wilson, I've had Morgan Stanley. You know, it's kind of unreal. And what's great about a guy like Mike Wilson and there's many others we talked to every day, folks, is they have a humility about it. Mike Wilson knows he's going to get it wrong at some point. And he has that earned what would you like to speak? Talking about earned humility. Marco, did you see him capitulate? He trimmed. I don't know if that's capitulation in Marco's world. I'm not sure that he'd appreciate that particular phrase. I'm just saying. I mean, he kind of walked back some of the risk of appetite that he had. Trim is overweight on equities. It's still overweight. All right. Fair fair. When he goes, I've underweight on stocks, then we'll make the change. We'll talk about the guilt market and the financial times a little bit later, as well. So guilty to super excited about that too. Let's wait through the price action for you. When the S&P 500, we are positive by 1.3% elevated in the equity market on the S&P pushing higher. Once again, in the FX market, it look at below cable, cable breaking lower by 8, tenths of 1%, 1, 12, 70. So the FT comes out this morning, Tom, and says the Bank of England is getting ready to delay the start of QC. Then the Bank of England comes out and says that report is inaccurate. They're making it up as they go. I thought it was a, you know, is a complete amateur. And this, I thought it was a difficult day for the Prime Minister yesterday. It was really hard. You thought yesterday was difficult. Of all the different days, yesterday was just difficult. The other thing I noticed in the data and finally folks are fairly quiet day is dollar yen. I was surprised. It's a solid 149 here. We get in closer, right? It's something here to watch. That's all there is to it. It was right now on a 10 year. It's just around this out for you. Pretty much, you've changed up almost the basis point to just north of 4%. Bramow, some big moves in this market the last couple of days. Yeah, how much earnings really going to feed into that? You talked about Goldman Sachs. The earnings coming out at 730 AM today. The last of the big banks to come out. How much is that really indicative of what we're going to see from the rest of the earnings complex, the rest of corporate America? Netflix after the bell, United Airlines and J behind some of the other names. It really starts to kick off in broaden in terms of scope of the companies that are reporting earnings. I am particularly interested to see the post-COVID darlings that have lost their luster like Netflix. United Air, I'm very interested in because Air Travel has continued to take off despite the fact that tickets are just so expensive and people still seem to buy them. Today, economic data includes US industrial production at at 9.15 AM. And NHB housing market index data at 10 AM and Tom, how much is home builder sentiment deteriorating? It's expected to go to the lowest going back to 2012. How much does this really lead to what you're worried about which is some sort of housing crisis? Well, yeah, I don't know if it's a housing crisis. It's going to be an adjustment, the mother of all adjustments here, or the mortgage rates here, 7%, 7%. The mother of all adjustments, a crisis, you know, tomato tomato.

15851," Here with mortgage rates, you're seven, seven percent. The mother of all adjustments, a crisis, you know, tomato tomato. And also today, Fed speak includes Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 2 p.m., Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushkari at 5.30 p.m. What do they say about front loading? We have heard this, you know, Jim Bullard talking about possibly raising rates to 4.75% by the end of this year. Is this the goal to raise it to that kind of level and keep it there and pause there and try to get ahead of it or is gradual more of the theme? And I think that that's going to matter, John, in terms of the risk appetite, what people see going forward for the Fed and rates. Hey, Lisa, thank you. Let's talk about the rate market. We can talk about QT and let's talk about sterling. We'll do that with Kitchhukes. Chief FX strategist is Sokchen. Kitt helped me out here. So when I report that QT gets delayed, sterling climbs to session highs through 114. On the pushback from the Bank of England, sterling falls to session lows. Kitthukes might have believed that QT is somehow sterling negative and delaying QT is somehow sterling positive based on a price action. That's what is telling me. What do you make of that? I think the price action tells you that by the time you've had two conflicting messages within one morning, the second one coming at the start of an guilt auction, everybody's looking at the UK and say, please, please, please, can you get the messaging right to us? We are all confused because, you know, what we need for the currency, what we need for the market is for the volatility to go away, for everything to calm down, and to put this kind of period of massive uncertainty behind us. So contradictory reports just don't help in that regard at this point in time. I mean, the most confusing thing of all next would be that all those are not planning on delaying the start of QT if they go on and do it anyway because of the volatility in the guilt market at some point in the next couple of weeks. And then we'll have full circle. Kitthukes, I thought you knew some people should say this. I thought your note today was really lovely and it was very indeterminate. It was like we need to wait. We need to wait. Now what? What do you do with a strong dollar reality given the unsettledness of your note? Can you go the other way and call finally week dollar? Or do you just sit here? I wish I could, but that's why I think that what we do is we get stuck with less volatility. I mean, you know, there are two problems with looking for a week dollar. One is you just have to embrace the idea that we're going to have the softest of soft landings in the United States and everything's going to be fine and lovely and the equity bulls are right. And the difficulty with that is if the economy doesn't slow, they'll hike more, not less. And we're going to get a very, very inverted curve by Christmas at this rate. So that's the first thing. And the second one, frankly, is still Russia, Ukraine, the whole problem that we have out there. That how do I turn around in Europe and say, I want to sell the dollar. Shall I buy the pound? Shall I buy the euro? I mean, I'm getting newspaper reports about, yeah, if we have cold days in the middle of winter and January, February, you're going to have to lie to law going to go out. That, you know, have we priced that in properly yet? I'm not sure. So it could, we could get stuck here. I guess that's the end conclusion of that until we get the next trend. And the next trend might be kicked off by the next leg up in 10, you know, just quickly. Jordan Rochester was on yesterday of Nomeura and he was talking about how, yeah, central banks are important. And really, it's about the economic trajectory. And right now, more of an austerity kind of approach from fiscal policy makers in the UK will lead to a deeper recession. And that means a more negative outcome for the pound. Is that the kind of rash now that you think is what you should be following? How much is the economy really the main driver here? I think the economy becomes one once we start focusing on the policy because it's not as important. And the economy is heading into a recession that could last a long time. And yes, to the extent that, you know, that there's a sort of a wisdom out there that says, what you need to do when your financial position as a country, your fiscal position's poor, is tighten fiscal policy really aggressively. And you know, in the hope that that will improve it as opposed to get yourself any chance of growing out of your fiscal problems, then we start looking more like Japan every second. And so, you know, that's pretty scary for a country like the UK with the current account deficit and for sterling. So yeah, it's not a great picture. I think the only piece about sterling right now is, you know, we're priced for a lot of bad news. Sterling can be held down here.

Hey, Kate, final question. Can Arsenal win the league? No. Is flat out no? Are you saying no because you're worried that if you say yes, it won't happen? I'm saying no because Manchester City are the best side in that league, whatever happened at the weekend. Kate, jokes are such, Jen. Thank you. I've given Kate so much grief over the last 10 years or so on his support of Arsenal Football Club and they're just refusing to engage the prospect of winning this title term. For a minute, in the audience, where are we? Where are we ending up? Are we still early in the season? Still early, Tom. OK. They're going to go on this ridiculous one month break for the World Cup, which I just... We're just in service. I did test the idea of. Yeah. Furious about it. And to be clear here for those of us that don't know, there's a team like Arsenal. All the different players go play through the streets. They've all got to go pay for their countries and then come back and get to lose a lot of momentum. They can't do anyone. I think you've gotten hockey with the Winter Olympics never worked out. Sterling negative three quarters of 1%, once we have 74. What did they do? Do ice hockey in the summer? They do that anyway, don't you? Yeah, they do that. But what about that?

15853," What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it has just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. Power, policy, politics from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill as I understand it is there'll be a multiplier effect. How did Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters? Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington nobody covers politics like Bloomberg.

15854," All I do know based on the events of the last couple of days is it looks like the chance there's in charge. We know Sterling 11289 is a litmus paper of this train wreck and truly what I learned at IMF are global train wreck with ramifications worldwide. Lizzie Burton is in London. She is in front of the House of Commons with Green Lather, the House of Lords with Red Lather and joins us this morning. Lizzie, I'm keeping count of the number of, I guess, Tory members saying out and it was two and then I think now it's four. What's the count this morning or mid-noone your time and how many ministers have to say out before it's three? I think publicly the herd is five which is not massive and I don't think that there's a particular threshold that they need to hit to change the rules because this is kind of a different situation. The Tory Party is the most successful political party in the world for a reason like a snake it can shed its skin. I think former Chancellor George Osborne said the other day that water will find its way downhill so if they were to want to replace Liz Truss they could find a way to do that. Although behind the scenes it is said that the letters are going into Saguay and Brady the Chairman of the 1922 Committee of Tory back ventures but it's not just how they do it it's also who would they pick. Yesterday in the Commons it seemed to be an open audition between Truss's cabinet for who would replace Truss. She had Penny Morden the leader of the Commons out to bat in place of Truss. She had to reassure the Commons that Truss wasn't actually hiding under her desk but the problem with Morden is she's thought not to have enough broad government experience to take over. Then you had the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his various appearances throughout the day but he's already lost two leadership elections and he says that he doesn't want to go for another one. There's always Rishi Sunak he's been notably out of the picture for the past few weeks but he's seen as a really divisive figure in the party. Perhaps he's staying out the way because he doesn't want to be seen as a backstabber in the way he was in the downfall of Boris Johnson but interesting in Westminster one thing I'm hearing about how Rishi Sunak could square the circle of not having to go to the public to get a mandate via a general election would be to claim that he has more of a link to Boris Johnson's mandate from 2019 because Johnson kind of went out for conduct reasons not policy reasons and Sunak would be closer to Johnson than he would then Truss would have been. Lizzie I'll allow someone else to explore whether we can see Boris volume 2. My question for you is focused on policy. The policy announcements are the last 24 hours. How have they been received and are we ready to see much more of the same before the end of this month? Yeah, markets do seem to have been pretty calmed by this. It's really hard to understate how much of a reversal it all was. He hasn't managed to close some of the fiscal hole but he still got £30 billion plus to go and in a sense he's reduced the need for a tug of war between the Bank of England and the Treasury by removing some of the stimulus but at the same time without the sugar rush it raises the recession risks. The interesting thing is that whatever Hunn did there was still going to be the more on risk premium. That's how T.S. Longbad put it because of the scarring to the UK's economic credibility done by Truss in that limited time, the borrowing costs for the government are higher. And so really Hunn is going to have to show more fiscal discipline in the form of austerity. Labour has already branded it austerity 2.0. He's going to have to do spending cuts. And interestingly he's appointed as an economic adviser, Black Rocks, Rupert Harrison, respected as he is in the markets. Welcome as it is that it's an acknowledgement of the need for this economic orthodoxy. Rupert Harrison was of course George Osborne, the former chancellor's right-hand man in the austerity years. So politically optically it's a very difficult link.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4200,2022-10-18 10:26:13

15856, fight through the day to say the least I also know dollar yeah and 147 148 weaker yen 149.12 is something maybe off the radar but all unglobal Wall Street glued to that currency pair right now Kristen barely joins us and she has an exceptionally important single sentence of courage in her research note anytime the index has sold off by more than 25% the three year future return has an average of 40% Kristen this is off the bounce how do you know when to step in and go long it's a really really hard decision and we can understand why people are naturally nervous given everything that's going on but I think for those investors that are able to take a long-term view and three years isn't necessarily a long-term view that data is is in your favor and and time it's certainly on your side so exactly as you said Tom the three-year forward return anytime that we've seen the S&P 500 sell off by more than 25% has always been positive and has average the total return of 40% five years it's actually 85% time is on your side there are buying opportunities here talk to us at city group about the huge advantage you have and I'm going to pick on Jim Suva today but there's horror what's in the rest of them you've got the security analyst talking day to day to day with the corporations now boynie hand came out at Bank of America said business is good J&J is giving some form of decent forward guidance what are you hearing from your research staff about corporations are weathering this moment yeah so I think coming into Q3 earnings and you were talking about this a little bit earlier the bar has been revised down and set pretty low so we could see some of those counter trend rallies on the back of it but what are we watching and what are we listening for in earnings all about the consumer so obviously that was a key point in financial earnings just listening to is the consumer strong are they continuing to spend I think there's a nuance here though is so as we see credit card balances increase as we're looking at spending patterns there's a big difference between nominal and real numbers here and so inflation is impacting our consumers they are impacting spending patterns and so inflation benefits top-line revenue growth so we have to get down to those unit numbers and see whether they're spending on the same things and whether they're buying the same quantity and that's something that can flow through to earnings and put pressure in on Q4 and going into 2023 as well Kristen I'm still stuck on the first point here talking about history and not necessarily predicting the future but being a guide for perhaps it is a good time to invest just based on how much stocks have gone down and I do ask is this time different I mean does that give you enough conviction in its own right to go all in with risk if you have a longer time horizon so to be fair here and so we are actually defensively positioned we're fully invested but defensively positioned in this market we believe that these markets require patience diversification and discipline so we don't want investors all in cash and so in our portfolios we're actually overweight fixing come ever since we saw I mean the 10 year right now at 4% for investors who are in cash and you even look out at six months teethills yielding close to 4% we want to basically increase those yields and see opportunities and fixed income in investment grade in in government in munis and even in prefers where we see some opportunity as opposed to going long financial stocks getting that yielding perfords of high single digits is something that's attractive and can combat some of the impacts of inflation so how much are you going to the long end of the curve and I go there because a lot of people have been hesitant saying yeah perhaps yields are close to their peak but not quite yet because we have seen at the whole curve shift up again and again again again this depends on the risk advocate of the investor I would say the sweet spot right now because we could continue to see some volatility is probably out about two to five years and most of our investors are long individual bonds so that ability to be able to hold and we have to remember that even just two years ago we had 40% of the world's government debt was negative yielding so seeing some of these yields out five years hit mid-single digits and slightly more is an area where we're comfortable and we're comfortable holding and with standing some of that market movement yeah but in a balanced portfolio right now I think of the great market patella on this how do you judge,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4202,2022-10-18 10:37:39
15857," is an area where we're comfortable and we're comfortable holding and we're standing some of that market movement. Yeah, but in a balanced portfolio right now, I think of the great Marguerite Patella on this. How do you judge between, forget about 60, 40 theory, it's all gone down in flames. How do you judge between bonds and equities, our equities given your enthusiasm, the new bond? Yeah, so I think this is why we're actually pretty balanced here and pretty defensive. So we do think that we are going to see peak rates. We do think that we are going to see peak inflation, but what you're going to see dominate over the next couple of months is volatility. And so you will see these type of countertrend rallies, like we mentioned, if you are playing that long game, there are certainly opportunities. But if you're someone who's looking right at the short term, what you want to have is that balance because Q4, so Q4 in US equities, going back to 1936, 81% of the time has generated positive returns. And average of 4.4%, it is the best quarter for US equities of any quarter throughout the year. If we have some surprises and earnings as well, but where do you want to be positioned there? You want to be positioned in dividend growers. You want to be positioned in sectors that will be able to withstand the recession. This is why you hear a lot about health care. Health care is a sector that's been able to consistently grow earnings for the past four recessions. Add a clip of about 8% consumer staples is close to 5%. So you're not stretching too much there, but you still have exposure to equities. What about high quality big tech? I mean, we're coming into that season. I think it's October 27th is going to get Apple earnings. What about big tech? So high quality big tech, you were talking about this earlier. We have to look at the international exposure. We have to look at at the pressure in terms of just how strong the dollar is overall. That being said in technology, there is a huge difference between profitable tech and unprofitable tech. And we think of unprofitable tech. I like to think of that as a call option on an unknown future. So in long term, secular bull markets and low interest rate environments, that call option on an unknown future is much more palatable than in this type of market condition. So even when I was talking about the dividend growers, these types of companies exist within technology as well. And you could make the argument that a lot of the profitable tech, we're going to be looking for those signs of not only margin compression, but we're also going to be looking for signs of durable demand, which of these companies continue to have durable demand. Whether that's in hardware or whether that's in software. Kristen, awesome to hear from you as always. Kristen Piddly there of city global wealth management. Are the earnings in big tech there as well? Netflix after the close? A little bit later Lisa. Yeah, how much are we going to see? Subscribers continue to decline. People are looking at subscribers. What is the buzz? Is that what you're way of asking whether you're watching Netflix right now? Netflix doesn't have the buzz. Agreed. Not on. That's my basic take. Is it all YouTube? I don't know what it is. I think it's mostly this stupid TikTok. Yeah, TikTok and Instagram, how much social media taking over and how much should we sort of see a saturation? And then try to crack down on multiple people using the same subscription and things like that. But how much does the subscriber count really increase and then how much of a bubble have we seen in some of these tech names that got inflated during the whole pandemic? We couldn't do anything else. You're watching House of Tracker on HBO. No, I'm not. I didn't go there. I don't know. There are people in my house watching that. That's what they say in a video. They like it? They like it. I'm not there yet. I just know. It's a bit weird. It's a bit weird. They're just Hollywood's just struggling. I mean, I want the new Star Wars thing. And it's like, okay, you know, okay, what did it cost? Well, that's the point. On a serious note, Tom, you've had the credit market supply extremely, extremely accommodative terms for some of these big companies that go out there and invest in some big, big projects. Well, and this goes to the question that you asked yesterday and we've been talking about, which is private valuations. And we're seeing in public markets. And I think perhaps that could be the takeaway from Netflix. How many of these companies that have got huge amounts of capital and investment and they're a public company, but there are a lot of private ones, cannot even come close to justifying it with the revenue streams that they're seeing and the cost required to keep that up. And the average cost chart on the Bloomberg Netflix, 18% weight on debt, apple 5%. There you go. There. Nice to be different, Lacey. You've been talking about for a while. I know, it was great there. I mean, she's talking about a call option on an uncertain future. That sounds like my third marriage. That was Kristen. Kristen, Lacey was before that. Just keeping on the strike in America.

A call option on an uncertain future. Does Apple get it done? That's what it all comes down to. We reported in the last couple of weeks that they were struggling. Maybe iPhone demand was faltering. I've heard that a lot over the last decade or so when it comes to the iPhone and every single time they just come out and just knock it out of the park. But this time might be different just simply because of what we've seen from my crime, what we've seen from Intel, what we've seen from all the chipmakers that have really had some pretty dire projection. So if that's a tea leaf to what the demand is for personal electronics, it's not exactly giving a good sign. Big tech reporting in the next couple of weeks, looking forward to that. Shaped in the market today, shaping up as follows. On the S&P 500, we are pushing higher on the NASDAQ 100 as well. Yodetan doing much at all still in and around 4% on a US 10 year for sterling.

Well, and what does their denial really mean? I mean, you raised this good point. It's what is it inaccurate? They said the report was inaccurate that the decision had been made. The idea, the decision had been made was inaccurate. I look the last couple of weeks in the UK, driving me nuts.

First, I'll be meeting Chinese artist and dissident by way away. And I'll talk to the novelist and political scientist, Elif Schaffer. Tune in to watch those who shape our world, explain how the world shapes us. This is Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quickshade. This is the first thing to think of when you think of a battery. For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Consumers are spending, they have money, they're employed, you can see the unemployment numbers and they have good credit. And that's good news for America, but it also makes a FESH job. Schaffer, because they're trying to slow down this American consumer, which is a very resilient thing. I think Brian Moynihan just said good news with bad news. Brian Moynihan had to CEO at Bank for America. Stop that the story, go on. These are suits and ties and everybody has some macro-belony questions about Jerome Powell in that. He stopped traffic in Davos with his precision on what he executed yesterday. The underlying business, the strength of the consumer, household banning sheets, we all know this and the reinforcing it. The issue for markets is exactly what he said at the end. Bannews for the Fed, because the Fed wants to slow this down. And for many people that means higher interest rates. And this is what we've seen with all of the data when it comes out, when it's good, people get really nervous and the market sells off. At what point though, is good news, just good news.

I saw it chart recently on the average credit score in America. I was shocked. It was like high 700s. Yeah. As some of these banks, isn't that surprising to you? Yes. Is the question of whether... That was the average credit score.

Lisa, I'd love to know. Thank you. I'm not going to share my credit score on air, Tom, but I was surprised that that was the average in America. Yeah. Well, they've adjusted a wide-minded easier. What's your other score? I think too much. I would help out a man. Or a crowd of my credit score. They're credit scores in the United Kingdom? Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. Same thing. Right now, this is important for global Wall Street Lean 4, as we talked about. Not the doom and gloom, but the challenges of Goldman Sachs, Devon Ryan, his senior research analyst, JMP, securities, out of Rhode Island, a citizen's company, threw these with us today. And what you need to focus on is his tenure. It's Sandler O'Neill. He parses banks like no one. Devon, I'm going to cut to the chase. You could have called your research note, baloney. And you say this is a return on equity juggernaut and Solomon and company are going to launch up 50%. What does the gloom crew get wrong on Fortress Solomon? A time of good morning. Well, I think the gloom crew, it's more of a near term versus long term. So I think in the lead in, there's a lot of uncertainty in the macro backdrop and banks, financials, Goldman Sachs, really not the first place people are going to be leaning in when there's uncertainty. So Goldman is now trading at one time's book value because of that uncertainty. But if you take a step back historically, Goldman Sachs trading at one time's book value is a very attractive proposition. And I would actually argue it's a better proposition today because their return on equity is more durable. And we expect that they can do double digit return on equity for really the foreseeable future. And even in this really tough backdrop in what we'll see today, I think is a return on equity of 10% or higher. And so that's really it. It's just, people are concerned about the macro and we appreciate that. Right. We're not dismissive. But, you know, this is a long term, you know, a pretty big opportunity in our opinion. I made a joke about it earlier, but it's not funny. There's a re-org yesterday. Will they execute this plan to your up 50% with or without Mr. Solomon? Well, I think Mr. Solomon is an important part of the equation. And I think he's done actually a really nice job. To me, that reorganization is a little bit more just, you know, exactly what that is. You know, just getting a little more organized around the business units. I don't see really too much strategically changing, you know, change, you know, how they report their results. And so it'll give people a little bit better sense of how different businesses are doing. But it also is a testament to, I think, where some of these newer businesses are going, like transaction banking, which, you know, really they started from scratch a couple of years ago, and it's already become what I would argue is a scale business. And they're starting to nip at the heels of some of the legacy and common banks that have been doing that for a long time. Wait, hold on a second, Devon. You said that you think that David Solomon's doing a really nice job. A lot of people probably would disagree, including the board, including some of the people who have to now reverse some of his changes and who call Marcus a big mistake. How would you push against that and say, even though it is losing money, even though it hasn't gained traction, it's not a mistake. Yeah, so, you know, on the consumer side, you don't start a consumer business and reach scale in two years or even five years. And the business is losing, you know, maybe a billion dollars or so in that ballpark, which isn't immaterial, but you're relative to a firm that's going to make well over $10 billion on the year, you know, it's manageable, you know, $40 billion, you know, in revenues. And so, in our opinion, this is just, this is part of a longer term opportunity for the company. And I do think they're gaining market share. You know, the first digital bank to a billion dollars, I cover Fintech very closely. A lot of Fintech firms are really struggling in this environment because they were operating business models that were, you know, really trying to be lost leaders to gain market share. That doesn't work anymore. And so Goldman Sachs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4206,2022-10-18 10:55:15
15861," really struggling in this environment because they were operating business models that were really trying to be lost leaders to gain market share. That doesn't work anymore. And so Goldman Sachs in our opinion, these are the moments where you gain market share and you separate, you don't necessarily see it in that very moment as it's happening. So I actually would push back and say that Data Salomon has been navigating a tough environment really since he's taken the helm and we are pretty constructive on some of these moves into these new businesses like Consumer Banking, Transaction Banking, what they're doing in asset management as well. Just quickly here, Devon, what's the proposition for a consumer facing industry at a time when we're heading into recession by almost all accounts? Yeah, so again, like you're not going to build the business for a recession and you know, recessions happen. But you know, this is a long term, you know, Goldman Sachs is building, you know, what's the next hundred years of the firm. And so in the very near term, you know, consumers actually been hanging in I think better than a lot of people thought. And that's why some of these banks are posting, you know, I think solid earnings. But, yeah, I think it's an area that we're a little bit concerned about over the intermediate term, but that really shouldn't derail in our opinion. The longer term story here, which is diversifying the business away from legacy parts of the market that are just not high growth, you know, capital markets do well when the economy is roaring, when the economy is not like we've been in this year, they're softer. Investment banking is down, you know, 40-50% in some areas. On the other side, you know, consumer is kind of chipping away and slowly growing. And we think that that's an area for Goldman that, you know, they're going to gain market share and will be a big story. Hey, Devon, thank you. Devon ran there of JMP securities. Just had one person message me over to Bloomberg, terminal subscriber. And they're looking exactly what I was looking at, the savings rate on a market's account. 235. 235. Would you take that brand? 235 compared to what you're getting at JP Morgan or Bank of America. I mean, yeah, it's a lot higher, which is a reason that's the big proposition. Yeah, in the math work, because net clean of the two and 20 I take on triple leverage all cash, triple leverage all cash gets under about a 3.1, maybe a 3.2. Not at the two. Actually, actually a really good message. They say Marcus pays out 235, two month bills pay out, they yield about 350. Why, and they just clip in 114 basis points in a minute of savings. There you go. And then they're asking how they lose in money. That's a conversation from the 70s. Well, but this is the issue because right now you're seeing Marcus offer these rates because they are trying to attract deposits. And arguably the JP markets of the world are not because they don't care if you take your deposits out apparently because they've got too many of them. So it's sort of the haves and the have nots. And why aren't they just clipping those coupons? Can I say out on Twitter, same quotes as guys, there's a cabinet meeting this morning. Sure. And they're like, who's running that? It's like, it's like, it's like, it's absolutely nuts over. Steading right now, 1266. I agree. It is nuts over that. That's okay. I just hate a chair of economy coming out from New York. This is Bloomberg. Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October.

15862," Update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy. I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third-party apps on the App Store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

This cycle is being defined not by its severity but by its duration. Higher global interest rates, lower equity prices and the stronger dollar, we think will continue into year end. I just think the stock markets washed out. I think that 3200 baht, if 35 doesn't hold, I think 3200 is the next natural place to go. I get it, we're probably not at the bottom, and there's more stress to come. But things are starting to look pretty reasonable if you can take a longer time horizon. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City from our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg's surveillance on TV and radio alongside Tom Keane. And Lisa Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Future's positive 1.35 percent. Later this RTK, Goldman coming up. Goldman coming up, and as we just heard from Devon Ryan, they're an optimistic view, given all the turmoil on the re-or yesterday. But as we mentioned in the last hour, John Goldman comes now on the back of Bank of America. I'm sorry, business is good. JP Morgan, I'm sorry, business is good. So far, so good, Brahma. That's the story of earnings season. Early days, but so far, so good. Early days, I would emphasize, because right now we've seen the banks. The banks are doing great because of the interest payments, and because things have not frozen up, so they can still continue to clip the differential of what they're willing to pay out to the depositors, which is nothing, and then what you're getting in the Bittibill market, which is quite something. So, you know, how much does that really get reflected in the rest of the world, and we start to broaden out today? Isn't that the conversation we had 90 days ago? Exactly. Yes. What if we learn? What are we learning? We're learning. We're basically confirming everything we already knew from these banks, which is the consumer strong. Bannet sheets are good. If we have a recession, it's going to be short and shallow, because they keep on asking, where's the excess? Which raises a question, are we going to be stuck with stocks rallying 6% 7% in one day for a prolonged period of time, because we have no visibility and no guidance, even the companies don't, because it doesn't seem like anything's just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4208,2022-10-18 11:03:43
15863," And are we going to be stuck with stocks rallying 6% 7% in one day for a prolonged period of time because we have no visibility and no guidance even the companies don't because it doesn't seem like anything's changing. But if you take a look at what's happening with rates, if you take a look at what's happening in some of the granular data, it is changing. But maybe in your brief, you're going to get you mentioned this last hour, maybe you're going to mention it again. I'm sorry, is United Airlines of more descriptive value to the market than Goldman Sachs? I think so with terms of the consumer. Tommy, that we're talking about. Yeah, Steve, Kirby is going to come out and say, I hear what you said. This is where we are. I'm sorry, I think it's just as important. Is it FedEx? No. Whatever you look at, all roads leading the same direction, this Fed is going to do more. And that's why many, many people just believe it's 75 again, Lisa, in early November. The bigger question to me is whether it's 75 again in December, whether we get to 4.75% by year end, how much that shifts a conversation when we weren't talking about the likelihood of the peak being much far below that. And that's why I say front loading is going to be really important. Is Jim Bullard leading the psychology here in terms of what needs to get done, especially given the surprise, the upside-surprise in CPI? I know I'm a broken record, and I know I've said this a million times, but I want to say it again, just briefly, just a couple of seconds, allow me. In the December Fed meeting, they did not even project rates, the median dot, at 1% by year end this year. And we're talking about four, five handles, year end. That's a monster shift. What else are we getting wrong, especially given how much everyone has come to this impression. If you take a look at Fed Fund's futures, people are on board. They see the peak being somewhere around 4.9%. We are getting close to 5% as a base case for this market. Let's precisely the question of Mask and Tom. We got this year so wrong, but for this Fed, just 10 to 11 months ago, what did we get in wrong about 2023? I'm going to talk, let's join the broken record society, and I'm going to say we've had higher interest rates before we did not die. Things move on. Corporations adjusted this and find revenue and earnings, even J&J with what? FX headwinds, okay? It's a worry, but it's not the end of the world. We accept in membership this is right is we are to the society. Yeah, broken records have broken records. Some of our aren't just in no record is. Equity futures on the estimate. Savings with a data at 1.5%. Equity's kicking higher, equity's doing okay. We get Goldman later this and Netflix after the close. More earnings still to come. Brammer's going to run you through the day ahead in just a moment. You're 10 year year in and around 4% on a 10 year maturity. There is. That's still stunning. You're $1.00 negative, 2.10% 98.24. And crude, Tom, did you see the latest reporting from the team down in DC? The White House could announce later this week another SPR release. Yeah, in 85, 42 West Texas, intermediate, that sort of surprised me. That's like the ammo you the gunpowder you use at 100. Submit terms coming up. Yeah, it's fantastic. That's just my possible. Yeah, I'm the two. About the politicized A. So politicization, the SPR a little bit later, maybe. Does Britain have an SPR? I'm not sure we do Tom. I don't know. 10 out of you. I think Liz Truss would be running it down right now. That's for sure. So she's waiting on the SPR, 65, 35. Coming up, we'll be speaking about the politicization of the S. P. I, I'm just kidding, although we probably will. Today we were talking about earnings, including Goldman Sachs at 730A at about a half an hour. Netflix at 4pm, also united airlines and J. B. Hunt. After the bell, I do think to your point, both Tom and John, that some of the other earnings might be more instructive than bank earnings, this particular season, just because banks are not the bell weather, necessarily, on the economic growth as some of these other companies. have more of a front running T-leaf kind of feel to them than what we're seeing out of the big banks which are really hanging in there better than people had expected. Today we get economic data including US industrial production at 915 AM as well as NAHB housing market index data at 10 AM which is positioned to see home builder sentiment fall to the lowest going back to 2012. Tom you've talked a lot about this how much is that rolling over? When does it start to bleed into sentiment among consumers with house prices declining with this feeling that perhaps we are entering some sort of housing market downturn that we have not seen since 2008 and we have a host of Fed speak today including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic at 2 PM Minneapolis Fed President Neil Cushcarrier through 530 PM. This is my issue I want to know about front loading I want to know if it's really a likelihood that we can get to 4.75% by year end. How much does that really change?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4209,2022-10-18 11:09:08
15864," Sorry, at 5.30 pm. This is my issue. I want to know about front loading. I want to know if it's really a likelihood that we can get to 4.75% by year end. How much does that really change the equation for people, John? Who increasingly are saying that perhaps a Fed needs to wait a bit now, take it slow and understand how much they're actually impacting the economy. Because there is a six to 12 month or 12 to 18 month lag time that people talk about that we haven't gotten to. Alisa, thank you Tom, the Long and Variable Lacks of Policy. The Long and Variable Lacks. Yeah, well, that's the codified and all the textbooks and the answer is coming off a pandemic. It's a little bit different. You see that in the volatility of equities and particularly what we've seen the carnage in bonds. Peter Scheer joins us now. The head of macro strategy, economy securities. Peter, your words, the wall of worry is so big we can climb. Peter, can you explain that for me? Yeah, no matter where we look, whether it's Russia, whether it's energy, whether it's China, our own earnings fears. You know, there's so much fear out there and it's been priced in. So I think we get this little bounce. It started nicely yesterday. It's continuing today. What I really like is yesterday afternoon, stocks held on, even as bond gains gave up. And overnight we're doing well, especially on the NASDAQ with bonds not doing much. So I think that's an important change that we've seen these past couple days. And I think that leads us to a further rally. Peter frame it around the VIX right now. We've not seen the catharsis. We've seen a lot of people say we need out to 3840, even 42 VIX. We're locked to the 3231, maybe a 30-amble right now in VIX. Frame your enthusiasm when you study VIX. So I see that going back below 25. I think we're kind of in this law, right? We're getting these earnings, but we've priced in so much negativity. I think we're going to get great earnings from the airlines, for example, they're coming out today. I think the consumer companies are still going to be struggling a little bit. So much is priced in, we can see VIX come down. And then the debate's going to start switching, as you've already said. OK, 75 for the next meeting. But what about the meeting after that? And I think we've got ahead of ourselves. Let's see how some of this data comes in. CPI was very misleading last week. We had the shelter component, which was the highest it's been on any given months since 1990. And there was no way that rents were the highest increase in a month in September. So there's a lot of bogus and lag stuff coming into the data. So I think we're going to get some relief on the Fed front. OK, Peter, I just want to understand the new consensus, because it seems like there is a new consensus forming that we could see potentially rallies in the near term, but over the long term, we probably haven't seen the lows. And this is something that a lot of people have been discussing, as we start to see some of the weaker data come in. So can we infer that weaker data is really going to be in the driver's seat and not necessarily a Fed pivot or pause? I hate using this word, but some kind of retracement by how quickly the Fed's going to be going. Yeah, I think we're going to be looking to say, let's call it data dependent. And as the data weakens, at first people are saying, oh, this is OK, it allows the Fed to pause. There's going to be some concern. This is actually going to be good. We get rates stabilized. My real concern is that then the pendulum swings way further. And the data is so bad that people have to really pull back from risk. So that to me, as the final stage is a real risk off type rally, where you see much lower yields, much lower stocks. But I think we still have a small chance of a soft landing. I don't think we get it, but that's what the market's going to start pricing in first is a softer, softish landing. And that's going to drive this rally. Pete, we've all heard the same arguments as to why this will be short and shallow. The excesses aren't there that haven't been built up in the same way. The balance sheets are stronger, both on the consumer side, on the corporate side. Pete, I know in a way you push back against that, Pete. Just give me the short a story as to why you push back against that argument. So one, I think the wealth destruction has been immense. And the wealth destruction has been very concentrated in a lot of these, not just individuals, but the companies. And they were the ones buying tech. They were the ones really pushing out tech. They were the ones buying semiconductors. You're seeing that pull back. You've seen this supply chain shock where companies are adapting to it, right? They're changing how they use semiconductors. So I think there's going to be this big drag on the economy. And everyone's completely ignoring OPEC Plus when they did say they're seeing less demand for energy. I think that we could have a much deeper recession. And I look at it, the consumer part of the business, right? Two dollars were being spent on goods last year, right now they're spending a dollar and a half on services. Once that gets captured, what do we look at next January? So I think it's very unclear how the consumer does come January. Hey Pete, one footer here from your buddy Antelwice. Peter Cheerther of Academy Securities.

Yeah, and how much does this really lead to the new consensus and I keep going back to this that Mike Wilson has been out in front But it seems like other people are kind of coming to the ceiling that people haven't fully appreciated the weakness That's going to cause the Fed to take their pedal off of the break how much is that really going to drive a new bout of weakness and then to your point What does that shake out in terms of the excesses right because we have seen at least for the Bank of England that a sudden move Can really pull a lot of things out of the woodwork that perhaps were unexpected we've got another big move today We're up by 1.6% on the S&P might Wilson and Morgan Stanley who you said Lisa seems to have a crystal ball talked about the prospect the Scope for a bear market rally heard the same thing for the fund manager survey over a BFA But ultimately Tom for the lows and the big rip BFA and Mr. Hartnitz say no cuts no glory There's a lot of technical damage.

15866," Today, what are the biggest challenges for General Dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nettlesome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element. I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. Thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost-effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. Still bullish but not as bullish as they were.

With Maria today on International Relations, our Europe correspondent, she is in London today. Maria, I believe it is all quiet on the Northern front. And the Northern front is a backstory in the media right now. And that is Belarus. Explain to us the dialogue between Moscow and Minsk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4212,2022-10-18 11:20:50
15867," In front is a backstory in the media right now, and that is Belarus. Explain to us the dialogue between Moscow and Minsk. Well, Tom, that is a key relationship, and it goes back two years ago. Remember, Lukashenko at one point really feared that his grip on power was going to decline. Vladimir Putin stepped in, but of course, the condition now is that he plays essentially his puppet. Now, Lukashenko will never say that he is, but in many ways he has participated in every way that is convenient for Russia. And you make a very good point. The Ukrainian say, let's be honest, the Belarusian army is not in good conditions, and they're not going to go and fight to kill, quote, the Slavic brothers in Ukraine. But it is a distraction for the Ukrainian army, which at this stage will tell you they are focused on the southeast. By the way, the Europeans also say, watch out, Belarus, or could be more sanctions to come if you join in this effort. But ultimately, the key question is, what does Vladimir Putin want out of Lukashenko and how willing is he to say yes to everything he demands? What is the European response to the news and the footage that we've seen the last couple days of these drones? Yes, and Tom, that is the key question. And when you asked European officials, I was on the phone this morning entirely with European diplomats, there's a number of things. We know now that these drones have destroyed 30 percent of Ukrainian nuclear – excuse me – power plants. A lot of this has to do with the winter season. What they want is essentially Ukrainians to freeze. That is part of the morale war that also plays into this. And then the European – well, what they are is that they want to find out if this is essentially a run that has to play this. If they supply this kind of technology to Russia, then it means that more sanctions are to come. But also, by the way, the Iran nuclear deal – well, you can kiss a goodbye because the only really engaged site here was Europe, and they save you, get belligerent with the Russians. That's also the end of story. Expect more sanctions. Marie, in the meantime, Europe is trying to come up with some sort of energy plan. I honestly cannot follow the inherent machinations of this and what the price cat means and who's on board and who isn't. Can you offer us some clarity on that? Look, I think we are actually – and this is what I'm looking at my phone every 10 minutes because we are going to get the head of the European Commissioners of Underline with an executive roadmap. Remember, she said gas prices need to come down. They have come down from August, but they need to go down further. We're expecting as a combination of measures. Now they talk about a dynamic price cap, which essentially is a cap that's not really a cap. It's more a trade-up. If there's a lot of volatility on one day, you halt the transaction and you close it for the day, the key is the percentage of volatility that they will allow. And then the other big thing is that they want to leverage the power of the European single market to buy gas jointly in this market. I would say one thing, Lisa, and that is every official, every diplomat that I speak to, they tell me I am less concerned now about the winter that I was two or three weeks ago. The real question now is, what do we do the next winter without Russian gas? Right today. That is the number one question. Maria Adelundin today. The European talk continues for Maria today, as it often does, Bramow. As we know, anyway, a point there on gas, gas prices have come down in Europe. That's important. And the fear of a very, very cold winter, I think, has been parked somewhat over the last couple of weeks. And we see natural gas prices, I think at about a three-month low in the Euro region. That said, how much could that change, especially as they see the pace at which some of the natural gas resources are pulled down, but also the lack of ability to rebuild. And that's what Maria has touched on. That's what you've talked about. How much they really still talk about idling factories or coming up with some sort of cohesive plan to limit manufacturing at times of peak use. And what does that do to growth? It is going to be very, very difficult to repeat the act next year with that Nord Stream. Anyway, we'll focus on that a little bit later. We need to talk about government too. Shnali Basik around the table with us. I'll walk straight, correspondent. Shnali, imminent a few minutes away. What are we looking for from government's next this morning? Details behind that big reorganization, but we also shouldn't get distracted from the numbers themselves because we are going to want to see goldman still beat all the things that they're good at. That is fixed income trading. We had Morgan Stanley bringing a 33% jump at that business. We want them to hold strong inequities because it's a time to gain share when the whole industry has been shaken up. And consumer, we've been talking about it all day. You guys were talking about it this morning, those rise and deposit rates at Goldman have been higher. And you are seeing a number.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4213,2022-10-18 11:25:31
15868," and consumer we've been talking about it all day. You guys were talking about it this morning, those rise and deposit rates at Goldman have been higher and you are seeing numbers come out now as we speak. So let's take a look at those. But really to your point here, they have been spending more for those deposits as they build this business. Are they going to see that as something that was worthwhile or something that they need to change course on? I'll pick up a couple of the numbers, Shanali and you can get digging into it as well. So third quarter investment bank in revenue, $1.54 billion, the estimate, $1.63 billion. Third quarter trading revenue, $6.2 billion, the estimate, $5.69 billion. If you break that down between equities and fake, let's do equities first, equities, $1,000 trading revenue, $2.68 billion, the estimate, $2.65, looking at fake here, Shanali, $1,000 trading revenue, $3.53 billion, the estimate, $3.04. So that's strong beat, right? That's what I was talking about right there. And as they consolidate those trading and investment banking businesses, you have them coming in stronger than their rivals. And I think that's where the rubber hits the road for Goldman Sachs. Now, again, they are putting out all those details on what that new business looks like. I think this will take a while today for the market to absorb as David Solomon walks to market through those numbers. Because again, what does this mean for the future of Goldman Sachs? You are looking at revenue coming in above expectations. You are looking at ROE also coming in above expectations, really matching that of Morgan Stanley. They're more efficient than Morgan Stanley, typically. But again, if they're making the same in terms of returns, what is the market going to prefer? Very quickly here. We're going to come back after we digest these numbers as well. I look at the long-term track record across four, five, six management, big banks outperform Goldman Sachs. His Goldman Sachs been a decade or two decade under performer? I mean, you're looking at today, it trades at less than priced a book. Wells Fargo is even more than that time. Wells Fargo trades at a higher book? Yes. So... That's stunning. Exactly. And Wells Fargo and all the problems that it has and still has, you're still seeing them trade higher than Goldman Sachs that does not have half the regulatory overhang today than it did have five years ago, even. So what is it that the market is not latching on to with Goldman Sachs? You are seeing the market now rewarding Goldman for those trading numbers, really, again, much stronger than all of its peers. So they're not showing just a strength in a tough market. They're showing market share gains. A shanali, thank you. Stick around. Lisa, up about 2% in the pre-market. How much has this gave David Solomon a bit more lifeline to build out his vision? We'll continue building out these numbers for you in just a moment. We'll catch up with Gina Martin Adams of Bloomberg Intelligence. Live from New York City with Goldman up a little more than 2%. Wall Street got it done in the third quarter.

15869," [♪ MUSIC Mmmm~~~ When you think space you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. The ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? Today's CFOs are reshaping the seasweet, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryott's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eremella at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. Two hours away from the opening power of life from New York City this morning. Good morning. The price action shaping up as follows. On ESMP 500 pushing higher, much higher, up around about 60 points on ESMP. Climate higher by 1.6% advancing 1.88% on the NASDAQ. The earnings so far, so good, government. The last one to cross the line just about five minutes ago. And helping over a low bar in a massive way. Trading revenue beat was a monster. She's going to talk about that in just a moment in the pre-market term. We're up by a little more than 1%. It is, I mean, the side of the argument here is a re-orged doom and gloom. Solomon, is he going to survive, etc. And John, I'm looking at this beautifully laid out, very traditional press release, the expansion of it. And I got to go to the bottom of the press release where anybody consumer, it's, it's, it's like, we do this every single earnings season. Yeah, you give them feedback on the press release. I do. They'll be okay. No, they'll be, they got like, you like goldmines. They like them all. They've all gotten better. Oh, you like them all. They've all gotten better. Okay. Who executes less well? Oh, Wells Fargo. Okay, you don't know the Wells release. It's just what you said. It executes less well. You think it's clumsy? I need to know what's going on on a percentage basis. Fast, I got to try to keep up with you know. You don't like the font? Yeah, I was about to say it's a font. Sometimes it's a font, then a font. You know, I can't even read a release anymore without having Tom's voice in my head. So, then change the font. Read a bill in Bank of America. It's really clear. Really clear. Very charty. Bank of America is very charty. I'm sorry to distract from this, but I do want to talk a little bit about some of the details of this, which is actually fascinating. Oh, thank you. And I'm really sorry. It was it was illuminating, but Goldman Sachs with their fixed income trading revenues. As Janali was pointing at really blowing it out of the water. And how much is this taking risk again at a time when spreads are very wide in liquidity. Is a question and you have traders are actually able to be market makers once again. 41% jump in fixed income trading. That's nothing to cry about. That is bigger than any jump we've seen at any other Wall Street desk by a percentage point year over year.

15870," to cry about that is bigger than any jump we've seen at any other Wall Street desk by a percentage point year over year. Now, if you listen to what Bank of America's buy-in Moynihan had told Deepid West me yesterday, what he had said is they don't want to be taking on too much risk, they want to be moving risk, they want to be getting it off their balance sheets quickly. The 10Q and what they are doing in terms of daily trading losses and value at risk will be interesting. Goldman Sachs' traders are coming to work. Now, also in the press release, very high up as they reorganize the business lines, they show you what the consumer is getting you. Let's go to the consumer at the bottom of the page yesterday, Marcus, it's a failure. I don't see a failure on the page, explain. So, what we're seeing in terms of numbers at the consumer and wealth businesses record net revenues and double what you saw a year ago, it beat Wall Street expectations by a hundred million dollars. So, even though this business is much smaller than the rest of them, they're still bringing in money. And remember, you guys were talking about it. Then what's the impatience about it? I just don't, I'm lost. Profitability. Now, they have raised deposits, the savings rate for their customers, high yield savings account much more than you've seen any of their peers. JP Morgan, Bank of America, when asked, they won't tell you that they will do it anytime soon. But Goldman Sachs wants those deposits at lower their cost of funding. So, this is not a business that looks like it's going away. This is a business that is going to be different than maybe we thought it would be in the past. Just quickly, fun and word on headcount. You've been following this story over the last few days. I can see the number from Goldman, the headcount increased 4% compared with the end of 2Q. What are we learning about? What's happening on Wall Street with the headcount? We're learning that the numbers are holding up better than expected. Even if you're not seeing big scale M&A, big deals happening, you're seeing spin-offs, you're seeing potential restructuring, and so on the corner. And you're seeing customers that still need to figure out what to do with their business and then hiring firms like Goldman Sachs. Imagine November, what's the ballet and the February of next year? I don't want to say that there's not anxiety on Wall Street, of course there is. Everyone's preparing for bonus season already because they're looking for what the best job is adding into next year. Competitive among the buy-side, competitive among the investment banks, but they will be efficient. They will keep a lid on costs, so the bottom performers will go. Goldman, up to them by 2.28% in the pre-market. No, thank you. Just awesome as always. There was a great message. You take the rest of the year off nationality. I know we're sharpening our pencils for their heads from it. You get three months off after that. That's done. That's down. You're an idea on Wells Fargo earlier was just brilliant. I think we can pull that right over, Chanel League 2. Gina Martin Adams joining us right now. Gina Chanel had the insight that Wells Fargo's book is actually better than Goldman Sachs. That seems like the mother of all opportunities on the sell side. Jamie Baker over at JP Morgan and others. They're looking at the airlines. A double. They're looking at Goldman Sachs. JMP security is up 50%. Is the sell side out front of this earnings recovery? I think the sell side actually has gotten too bearish on the earnings growth in the near term, but anticipating a recovery into the next 12 months. This is classically what's happened pretty much every quarter since that devastating fourth quarter release season at the early start of this year is analysts have clearly struggled to get the bogey right on 2022. They really severely cut estimates into second quarter earnings, first quarter, second quarter, and now third quarter earnings season, reflecting that sentiment, but companies continually come in and beat those expectations. But it's a near term revision cycle. So they're not saying, look, next 12 months it's going to look awful, but they are capitulating to the short term. That's what we saw headed into this earnings season once again. Analysts were expecting nearly 10% earnings growth in third quarter as of June. They're now all the way down to 2%. So of course, companies have helped them by guiding them and to anticipate less, creating a much lower bar. But nonetheless, companies are able to beat 2%. And that's what we're seeing so far this earnings season. Traditionally, Gina Martin, Adam, as we talk about banks being the tea leaves and banks being the front runners in JP Morgan kicking off the season. Is this time different or banks really don't give us much of a read at all on the rest of the complex of corporate America? You know, I would argue Lisa, that's been the case for a while now. We've gotten really accustomed to banks actually disappointing us relative to expectations. And that's not necessarily been a predictor of what to expect for the rest of earnings season. Now banks are beating expectations. Maybe that's not a predictor of what to expect for the rest of the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4216,2022-10-18 11:38:32
15871," And that's not necessarily been a predictor of what to expect for the rest of earnings season. Now banks are beating expectations. Maybe that's not a predictor of what to expect for the rest of earnings season. Banks do tend to march to their own drumbeat. Yes, we want to look at the consumer read through. We want to look at lending growth, but in an environment where liquidity is extremely ample, easy to access, that sort of lending queue has not been particularly profound as a driver of overall economic conditions. Obviously companies, for example, are getting their getting tremendous amount of cash. They're still sitting on large cash loads. They're still generally producing some cash flow. That is funding operations and certainly funding activity outside of financial sector lending conditions. Credit spreads likewise have been very tight relative to past experiences of stress. So credit has been somewhat ample, especially over the last year. So I think that the financials, while they are an indicator of some things, they've really lost their lead in a lot of ways. Maybe that lead is reestablished over the next couple of quarters, but this year in particular, we haven't seen financials operate as a leader. Is there a leader? And I asked this at a time when we talked about United Airlines, for example, some of the airline companies that might be benefiting disproportionately from business travel, from upper income individuals who are still able to travel even as lower income individuals, pull back on spending at certain retailers or certain consumer facing shops. What is the industry to watch? Yeah, there are three segments that are very traditionally leading indicators of overall market activity, as well as overall earnings trends. Those are semiconductors and the technology space. Obviously, that's been an area where we've been watching inventories very closely. They're home builders in the consumer discretionary space, notably home builders have actually broken out of a downtrend. Will they be able to establish a steady pace of earnings growth over the next year? Is a very huge question. And then the third is transports within the industrial space. Those are the three segments that are truly indicators of actual economic conditions. They're the most important segments to watch for earnings cues going forward. I'd say the only other thing I'd load up on in there is mega cap stocks, the five biggest stocks in the index are now driving roughly 20% of income. They're about 25% of market cap of the S&P 500. So for the large cap index specifically, this group is impossible to ignore. Gina, I want to pull out that book you and I loved white sandy freed and Ben Page 842. They talk about effects adjustment. My amateur take is 2 to 3%. Multinational. There's a, you know, who cares? It's noise. We're clearly not in a noise aspect that 2 to 3% effects. Headwind. What's the new number? Yeah, it's going to be a really interesting earnings season. Usually we get about 30% of companies on the index are actually exposed to currency because those are the biggest multinational companies. They're the ones that actually sell overseas. The companies most exposed to Europe and China in particular are the companies to watch. That's about 17% of sales on the index. But the degree to which the currency has moved would suggest that these companies are going to experience some degree of pretty extreme currency pressure provided they weren't hedged coming into the season. Now I think what's interesting about this is going into second quarter. Remember, we had the same phenomenon. The dollar was absolutely surging into second quarter earnings. We did see the multinationals generally underperform note currency as an underperformance factor. It had almost no net impact on the stocks. So will it impact the stocks is a very different question that will it impact the earnings stream? We think it definitely will impact the earnings stream at this point in the cycle every one percent gain in the dollars worth about 17 bips on earnings growth. So we do have an impact overall, but will it impact the stocks or is it in the stocks as the key question for investors? Hey, Gina, wonderful.

In which case, this is an appropriate use of the SPR to get over a short-term one-off car to cover a flow issue. Or is it something bigger than that? And if you believe it's the latter, then we're exposed next year and a little bit more vulnerable to them than we otherwise would be. We will see.

We get a view on the economy with Stephen Rechudo. She feels economists at Mizzouo, the tech team of Rechudo in constant outstanding at Mizzouo. Steve Rechudo, I want to talk about the hope and prayer that inflation will come in. We're beginning to see glimmers of goods inflation coming down off of all the pandemic gyrations. Do you model that goods inflation can get back to a strong disinflation or dare I say deflation? Well, really good question. I think the answer to that is, after we get through this cycle, there is a reality that is going to settle in that the world still exists in excess supply. And then in fact, through the diversification of supply chains, we've probably amplified that excess supply, especially against the backdrop of global decelerations and growth that are likely to be sustainable, not just in the US, not just in Europe, but also in China. And the net result is since we haven't destroyed the capacity as a result of the COVID shock and the latest inflation and the results of that, we're going to be sitting with too much capacity at some point in time. And that will drive down as good prices and will lead to a deflationary bias down the pipeline. But the key, I think for you, is is this going to lead to near zero interest rates again? And the answer is probably not. Doug and Florida grilled the New York Yankees this afternoon for PM. He emails in and says, Asperchudo about housing. How does housing fold into service? And goods inflation? Well, I mean, housing is a critical part of it. It's one of the most interest rates sensitive sectors of the economy. The automobile space is the other side that's very, very interest rate sensitive. And we're seeing problems developing in both of those spaces. And yes, as demand gets pulled back, those are big ticket items. Those are items that get reflected very, very quickly in terms of the change of production. And I think those are part and parcel of what we're experiencing in terms of the downward draft that we're already getting in terms of goods inflation. We're still struggling with the service inflation component of this, however. Steve, you said something that I want you to elaborate on that we're probably not going back to zero percent interest rates again in the near future. What is the baseline interest rate that you see as where we end up once we're out of this inflationary and then disinflationary period? Yeah, I think it's around 2%. I think it's just with the underlying trend rate of growth in the economy as to where real short-term interest rates have to be. The near zero-instraight environments occurred in an environment where we had systemic credit issues that had to be corrected in the economy. And therefore, you needed to create abnormally low levels of interest rates to correct that problem. In this environment, we don't see those structural credit issues. There are going to be companies that go bankrupt. There are going to be financial institutions that have problems in here. But if you go back to areas like 1975 where we didn't have systemic credit problems really dominating the business cycle, we had upwards of 140 financial institutions that needed to be resolved and two insurance companies that needed to be assumed by other insurance companies. And we didn't have a systemic credit risk. So there are going to be casualties as a result of this. But they're not going to lead to a systemic credit crunch environment. The casualty, Steve, how much is that going to be the fiscal programs of a lot of developed markets? How much are you going to see a massive program to reduce debt in the developed world? Well, there is no doubt that there's a lot of debt that has been accumulated, but also keep in mind for most of these and most of these governments, including our own. A lot of the debt is now being internalized by central banks. And therefore, in our case, in particular, all that interest expense gets credited back to the U.S. treasury. And therefore, is pretty much of a net wash. I don't think we're going to really reduce the debt as much as we are going to allow the economy to grow around the debt, which means we're not going to be able to go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4220,2022-10-18 11:55:53
15875," Net wash. I don't think we're going to really reduce the debt as much as we are going to allow the economy to grow Around the debt Which means we're not going to be able to go through expansive fiscal policy programs for quite some period of time without having it being reflected in long-term interest rates I stay if you want the best is always great to hear from you Steve. We're shooting there of Mizzou on the latest Did you see the Muhammad Ali in tweet yesterday?

I think real issue with this I think in inverse evidence is pretty sure to Muhammad and I know well did a tour to force and the telegraph on this the traditional theory and the Construct of it including the Phillips curve and as the laureate Krugman mentions the beverage curve They don't work in a pandemic-adjusted Regene shift to use Bullard's phrase and with that they're flying blind every moment They've made mistakes no question about that But it's not within a normal Theoretically founded structure. It's original. They're allowed to make mistakes. Celesis point Senator Sanders, Senator Warren. This is all just getting going This is the beginning. It's not the end of any of this when you start to see unemployment guy the other way and the Fed comes out and says Yeah, this is the objective. We've got a problem and this is going to be an even bigger discussion When you go to the point that we were just talking about where you have basically monetized fiscal budgets and that's something else It's an issue. It got features at 1.8% on ESMP live from New York. This is Bloomberg So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received But that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today Like I do many times, you know what makes a great investor a great investment firm is comprised of people who are Optimus and pessimus and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression.

15876," I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day, and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Hello, I'm Emma Barnett and I'm a journalist and presenter. This is my new shirt, Emma Barnett meets. First I'll be meeting Chinese artists and dissidents by way away, and I'll talk to the novelist and political scientist, Elif Sheffert. Tune in to watch those who shape our world, explain how the world shapes us. This is Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quicktake. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology, Bloomberg crypto, today on Bloomberg. The difference between endless research and a winning strategy. To improve your firm's productivity and profitability, Bloomberg Law combines the latest in AI-powered tools and in-depth analysis, to accelerate the research process. To grow your practice and make better use of your valuable time. The difference is Bloomberg Law. The Fed is still the central focus. And where it comes to the dollar, there's a lot of concern. Clearly inflation is becoming more entrenched. I think it's in February and March. That's the sort of timing I have for dollar weakness to come back in. The Fed is on a mission. This is a very intentional and aggressive tightening of domestic monetary conditions. This is a long, drawn out multi-quarter economic downturn. Not something that's going to reverse quickly. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning, everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Bramowitz and Tom Keane on Radio on television. Jamie says, business is okay. Brian says, business is okay. David says, business is okay. John, there's a theme here. Don't forget, Jane says the US economy remains relatively resilient. The single chief on Wall Street is basically telling me the same thing. Free queue is okay. Business is doing okay. We saw this the last quarter as well. And the one I guess is as Bramowitz says. It's the view forward and the conference call and we'll have to see what they say. The view forward is uncertain. If you want to get bullish, the ultimate lows according to Bank of America, Mr. Hartnet, Front half a 2023. No cuts, no party. We'll see what happens again. We look at equity, sponsor currencies, commodities. We'll do that in a minute. Here a fairly quiet day. But John, not quite in the United Kingdom continued volatility for Governor Bailey. I mean, I can't keep up. So the FT came out overnight and suggested this Bank of England was ready to delay QT. Then the Bank of England came out several hours later and said that report was inaccurate. So Tom, you decide. And still in between, it's been absolutely whip-sort. And if you're going to watch it, you'll get the full budget at the end of the month. And the Bank of England is going to make a decision in early November to high interest rates. Tom, maybe by 75 basis points, perhaps even more. Lisa, you featured earnings earlier in the brief. And to me, it's the arc of the elites doing really well in a whole bunch of other people really struggling here within the UK, the US, and frankly, the global economy as well. It looks like it's two global economies. As a reason why it's going to be even more political as the Fed continues to tighten rates in response to the inflation and the persistence that you're seeing, particularly with people who do have more money that are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4222,2022-10-18 12:04:29
15877," even more political as the Fed continues to tighten rates in response to the inflation and the persistence that you're seeing, particularly with people who do have more money that are spending it. And we talk about how it's an uncertain road forward. The earnings have been looking good. And so right now you're having a 4.93% Fed funds rate being priced into the market as of March 2022. What does that do to the economy? 23. 23. Yeah, I lose track of these years. But still that's on the edge of 5% and John, we're not framing that. Look at this rally. 1.8% on the S&P 500. We had a monster move yesterday and we're adding to it. Ben market rally. I think that's what many people are calling it. Might Wilson and Morgan Stanley expected it. Okay, Wilson's been very good on this and some of the bulls are adjusting. We'll get to that in a moment. Andrew Shees with us in a moment. I don't start the data. I'm going to go to Yen, which is in I guess intervention territory. 149.13 on the edge of one fifth. Kick it off with equities. Get the board up. Equities absolutely flag with flag here again by 1.9% on the S&P 500 futures up 69. You know what's not doing much in and around 4% on a US 10 year at the front end of the curve through 4.50 last week and the conversation we've got to have. How much scope is there for more upside on pricing this Fed terminal rate? You said we're close to five right now. How much further are we willing to push this? But that's not the issue right now that people are talking about. It particularly Peter Sheer. He's talking about what's the weakness that would have to be seen for them to pull back from this and how is that going to be priced? And I almost got the sense that once we treat bad news as bad news, that possibly is when we start to get the capitulation that everyone's been looking for for the next cycle. But what you make of how we treat in the data so far, we have that monster upside surprise on CPI and then we rallied really, really hard and we're doing the same thing again this week. Daufe just up 500 points just to get your attention. Thanks to the limited financial conditions index 1.5 to 1.2. It's less restrictive and this morning Andrew Sheets knows that as Chief Cross asset strategist Morgan Stanley and joins us. It's going to be amazing set of meetings Andrew at Morgan Stanley today to recalibrate into November. Take the jumble and make sense of it. How do you recalibrate to the end of the year? Well, thanks and it's really nice to be here with you guys. So, like I think you have an overlap of a tactical story with a with a bigger strategic story. Tactically as you heard, my colleague Mike Wilson turned tactically bullish on the S&P as of Sunday night. You know, he sees the potential for a rally to 4,000. A number of the tactical indicators that we followed you suggest a market where sentiment's pretty negative things look oversold. Maybe actually earning season after a lot of negative guidance turns out okay and you're into a window where seasonality for risk assets is often somewhat better. But big picture, you know, we still have growth that's going to be slowing over the next three to six months. We still have a lot of monetary policy tightening ahead of us. Even if markets don't price anything in additional above what's what's already expected. So and you still have earnings that we think in the US and Europe will need to be revised down, you know, in the fourth quarter or the first quarter next year. So I think the way to think about this is a is a bear market rally. It's short, it's sharp. It still matters, but the big picture hasn't changed and there's still work to be done. I think before we can say this bear markets over. Andrew Tilesis' point with pricing a big rate hiking cycle, maybe we haven't started to price in the consequences just yet. What do you think the consequences will be and can we put some numbers on it? I hear this short shallow nonsense all the time. I have no idea what it actually means. Andrew, what do you think it means? Well, I think it means that you could see a downturn that matters a lot more to earnings than it does to GDP. That we've been through an environment where goods consumption has soared relative to services consumption, you know, the type of economy where kind of everybody buys a barbecue and nobody goes to the dentist, so to speak. And that's the type of environment that is generally good for earnings. The S&P 500 global equities are really good at monetizing goods and turning them into earnings. There are a lot less good at monetizing services and turning those into earnings. So I think you could have an environment if you look at those consumption series where goods demand comes down, services demand holds up pretty well. The overall GDP effect is pretty modest, but ultimately the earnings impact is larger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4223,2022-10-18 12:08:49
15878," you know, goods demand comes down. Services demand holds up pretty well. The overall GDP effect is pretty modest, but ultimately the earnings impact is larger. And now, you have to be more specific. Housing is so important to goods demand. You know, think of it every time somebody moves, people buy furniture, they buy electronic goods. There's a lot of stuff that gets bought in a housing transaction, and yet given this move in rates, we're seeing housing transaction volume really decline, you know, to some of the sharpest to acceleration we've ever seen. How much are long dated bonds the best haven right now? If people are starting to think that perhaps we're pricing in peak fed or pricing in a fed that gets as aggressive as we've seen for decades. Well, I do think you've seen more value come back into the long end of the market, but again, I think you also have some challenges there where you're dealing with a pretty high-vol, asset class. And I think there's some really legitimate uncertainties around where new neutral rates are going to be, and also where what is the type of real interest rate that's required to slow the economy. And I think we still don't really know that. And I think there's a genuinely large clad of uncertainty out there. So I think it's probably still a little bit too early to go into the very long end of the curve, but one asset class that we think has a good risk-war combination here would be something like one to five-year corporate bonds in the US, the yield about five and a half percent. And that's not that far away from the earnings yield of the S&P 500. And there's an asset class that we think can still provide some pretty decent income above what we think inflation is over the next 12 months, while still providing some ballast and less volatility than other things. Andrew, just one final question. The number that jumped out for me in your latest report, my Wilson's from Iverdaw Weekend, was just how far you think this bear market ran it can go. Something like 4,100. Now, Andrew, that's a big monster move higher. And Andrew, I wonder when you look at that, at what point would you look at it and say, oh, maybe we're not right about this. Maybe this is more than just a bear market, Rallye. What would tell you? Sure, so I do think the inflation numbers are very important. If we see positive surprises to inflation, there is a lot of good that can come from that, right? Then the market can start to think, maybe the Fed doesn't need to do so much. Maybe we can start to see the Fed backing off, and that relieves pressure from rates, which can swing back into equities. I think seeing the labor force participation continue to climb, that would be quite good, suggesting the supply side of the economy is stronger, that we can have more growth for a lower level of inflation. And then the earnings front, you know, a reason why we've been cautious has been around the view that margins will come down ultimately and earnings estimates will come down. Maybe the inventory problem is better than we expect. Maybe companies are able to defend margins through cost cuts that don't impact the broader economy to such a negative extent. And I think that's really more key of slice. Okay, Andrew, you and a team have just been absolutely awesome this year. Appreciate it. As always, Andrew Sheetz there of Morgan Stanley. Appreciate it what Andrew had to say there. Drew a distinction between GDP, short and shallow, and earnings, maybe not short and shallow. Tom, there's a difference. There is. I'm going to go back to us on the revenue dynamic and down the income statement. You can choose it. And it's different sector to sector what happens on the income statement. But they're going to adapt, as Mr. Sheetz talked about at the end there, they're going to, it's going to be one part pricing power which we all know. It's going to be one part cost cutting. And you know what, they're going to get to the other side. Drew Manus and MetLife, right scent on the Bloomberg. Lake Street said short and shallow, that's the pushback. Yeah. Get a lot off. Well, and this is sort of the economic play, but just going to what you're talking about with earnings. How much going back to what Steve Rashido said, do we have to reset corporate performance and the earnings in a 2% fund's world? If that's where we're heading back to, it's not a 0%, it's 2%. How much do you take away from the momentum of the financialized world and potentially give back to the real economy? Be a face fund manager survey today, the theme of it was capitulation. And if we can push that just one step further and build on what you just said, I don't think people have capitulated at all on the view about where we go after all of this, the destination. The destination for so many people still is to go back to the pre-pantemic playbook. We have low rate, low growth, low inflation, and Tom, that's a view that we have not capitulated on. This is how far down we are into your point, and I agree on capitulation. I'm not going to use Dow points up 523. I'm going to look at SP.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4224,2022-10-18 12:13:20
15879," Oh, inflation and Tom, that's a view that we have not capitulated on. This is how far down we are into your point. And I agree on capitulation. I'm not going to use Dow points up 523. I'm going to look at SPX up 73, 3,700 rounded up 3,800, two standard deviations. You don't even get through resistance until 3842. We're still distant. How many times are you going to squeeze Dow points into this segment? That's what America cares about. We look at Dow points and we know we're distant from 36,000.

Time to assemble airtight gas pumps. La willaine What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships, working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4225,2022-10-18 12:17:16
15880," to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 car's rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car and decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

Michael, I'm gonna digress here to one that thought you heard was me falling off my chair is Mr. Murdoch wants to piece, empty, dumpedy back together again. What did you think when you saw young Murdoch said, let's bring it back together again? Yeah, that was not the other playbook we wanted to see. We have a buy-in fox, Robert Fishman covers it. Our view in fox is it's a pure play on sports and news, which we think is the glue to the bundle. And they're not wasting their money fighting streaming wars, right? Tom's a very clean story. We thought at some point they would self-fox to private equity or another, the other media company. So here, I think what the narrative is from here is the company is gonna need approval from the majority of the minorities. And I don't think that's coming because I think the clients we talked to who own box are not happy with his decision.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4226,2022-10-18 12:22:42
15881," approval from the majority of the minorities. And I don't think that's coming because I think the clients we talk to who own box are not happy with his decision. I'll see what comes next. There's probably a second leg of the story, right? They put it together and then do something with those assets which we're waiting to hear more from the Murdox of what's their intention after they combine these two companies. Just because of the calendar, I've got to go to Netflix. They're teetering on three legs. Someone even say a two-legged table is, well, what will you listen for from Netflix today? Okay. So they're introducing an advertising tier for $6.99 in the fourth quarter. What I want to hear is why they're so confident that there won't be a spin down as they say in the UK from a higher price point down to this new tier, which would be very dilutive in the near term for revenue per users. So I like to hear why they're so confident that this will not be in the near term a very dilutive strategy, right? That's to us, you know, given their dropping price and as we talked earlier, they don't have the same grip on users as they once did. I think there's a risk that there's a spin down here. Michael, how much are you looking at the potential for some of these media darlings, the online streaming services, certainly during the pandemic at least, being acquired by the likes of Walmart, being acquired by the likes of Apple. And this has been something increasingly rumored about. Yeah. We're the challenge we have as some of these companies are family held, you know, Tom mentioned the Murdoch's. The Redstone's control, Paramedic Global, NBCU is controlled by the Roberts family. There has to be capitulation, which we don't see yet, right? Everyone thinks they have the right strategy of bleeding linear and investing in streaming. At some point, we think of the next 12 months, there will be capitulation. Companies will realize that they have the wrong strategy, they don't have the balance sheet to make this pivot, they're under size. And maybe there'll be some M&A, but that's not our working thesis right now, right? There has to be some level of realization that these strategies are just not going to work, right? Like you have four or five large players in streaming with much better positions. So the people who are lagging have to have to get out and I'm much for the right to do that right now. So who do you think the ones that need to get out actually are? Well, you would say that Peacock Paramount, there has to be some combination, that'd be Comcast and Paramount Global, that they've done well within the US, but they're really not, they're not going to scale to that higher level with a profitable business model. They will need to find some way to combine, combine streaming assets, with some happens to Warner's, WBD. Yeah. You know, like the market is really worried about the debt load there. There's a true asset value of that company, but the debt load is scaring people away. So you would say those three companies need to figure out some path forward, maybe consolidation to get some more scale. Michael, do you think the Disney's making the cable package, the cable bundle all over again with Hulu? Is that where that's going? They're trying to, right? So they have Disney plus, Hulu plus, Hulu and ESPN plus. You know, our concern is the cable bundle is the best product we've ever seen in a promo, an economic standpoint, right? Everyone's paying the same amount of money, you know, it's watching the same amount of channels. You have to be very, very careful not to further disrupt that bundle. I think Disney thinks long term we have the goods that we can replicate the product, but the economics of that new offering are going to be so below the economics, coming from. So I think it'd be really, really careful, but they have the pieces in place. I'm just hoping that the speed to change is slower by them than maybe what they want to do. Michael, we didn't have you on for all this chat, chat. Yankees Cleveland, cut to the chase. Well, that's hot. The guy behind me, I wish he was pitching tonight, right?

Nathanson says with facts, it's all about sports because that's all this life. We've been fights about round as at school. We just took it that seriously in the UK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I was really serious. Guarantee that somebody is screaming at the screen right now because Tom said, you have to go with Yankees and all the Metz fans out there absolutely live it.

We have a few futures right now at 2% on ESMP 500, adding to yesterday's gains, you're allowed by three basis points, you're 10 years, 397, 57, and the FX market. I don't know what those hand signals are, 98.45. We're back in the pits again, which is sort of like gesturing to me. You're having a food fight on Twitter on the doubt. True, 85.52. People get so angry on Twitter. It really makes me laugh. What was this individual talent that I can read it out loud for you if you want to? Please dispense with your silly trash talk of the down, not being representative of US stocks, Apple, Microsoft, Goldman. It's not about the members, it's about how the members are weighted. That's all. And for the people who complain about this, are you allocated to the down passively? Yes or no? So much they said that probably not. I get it. The fact is you do both. I get it. And you've been asked that one under not NASDAQ composite. I get it. I'm on board. You can do it by or means. Well, 31,000 was not broken as a Vex. VIX 32 30.72 has not come in given the enthusiasm of. And are you just going to be on Twitter? I was someone who created. I'm Twitter. Somebody said that I'm wearing a snaggy today. So what is that? It's not a me too. Let's move on. Yeah, it's like a kind of baggy thing. It's okay. I wish I were in snaggy. It's going to clean the job. Let's see. Let us continue right now. And we do so and celebrate the holiday season. We begin Thanksgiving with Jerome Schneider, managing director ahead of short term portfolio management and advisor and Thanksgiving dinner at Pimco. And here I'm Bloomberg surveillance as well. How's your year been short term paper is a place to hide, right? It's busy. It's quite busy and absolutely short term papers are placed to hide. I think the nuance is a short term paper really are what the story is about for 2022 and actually 2023. Folks as you've highlighted before is cash is not necessarily as democratic as people would like to think. While cash is king, the crown jewel of how you want to think about it is really more nuance than that. Yes, bank deposits are some cases slowly moving higher. T bills may offer some attraction, but the reality is they're trading actually quite rich in some cases 30 to 50 basis points through benchmark rates, meaning what the Fed is expected to be at. So there is other value if you actually want to be more appropriately highlighting and thinking where interest rates should be headed based upon Fed expectations. Pimco meeting that you have out there, the 10 a meeting, whatever the legendary meeting is. What do you say about the short term space and dollar illiquidity worldwide?

15884," Dower illiquidity worldwide. There was no other theme, IMF. Well, there's a reality of what we're thinking about is that we are facing a change where people need to digest the changing cost of capital. And the notion of liquidity is one that has been more prolific. People are concerned about liquidity has been sort of a call word, if you will. But it means very different things to very different people. And I think that's the consequence of when we want to think about the marketplace. You have macroeconomic liquidity. You have liquidity concerns driven to quantitative tightening. You have haircut concerns and margin requirement concerns, which we've clearly seen within England. And more importantly, as the economy progresses to more of a state of concerns about growth, then we're going to see other tightening ratchets of illiquidity and haircuts. Those are the liquidity facets we really need to be paying attention to. So from a starting place at PIMCO and everybody else, we have relatively judicious high amounts of liquidity, preventative liquidity, defensive liquidity. But the key then comes into how do you use it? How do you think about it opportunistically given the uncertain outcome, given the growth environment, given the slow GDP, but perhaps shallow, but longer recession that we think at PIMCO. And then ultimately, how do we then extrapolate that to value in the future? So it's all about really how does liquidity translate to volatility within the marketplace and how do investors absorb that volatility properly? The problem for a lot of people in the market right now, as you know, is when you expect there to be liquidity in an asset class where there should be liquidity, and then there is not. Can you talk to us about what's happening in the treasury market? We know that last week the treasury reached out to a group of individuals. The treasury has this connection with a group of individuals in the market. They speak to, they try and get feedback about what's going on. One thing they asked about was whether they should buy back certain securities to improve the liquidity and the functioning of the market. What do you say back to that? There's this has actually been top of mind, not just simply over the past few months. And we published a paper at PIMCO, sort of highlighting this, suggesting some all-to-all trading. And actually elicited some pretty positive constructive dialogue within the marketplace. That's a function aspect of where we want to think about where the market and how the market is digesting actual functional high-quality assets. It is a concern, but it's also an opportunity for investors. Those investors, they can really think about how to maneuver around these higher cost of capital. And more importantly, the opportunity sets because of the wider bid offers. So what I would suggest is, yes, it's a transformation from what we've been used to over the past one to two decades. And it is a concern when you think about some of the curtailments that you have more regulatory and sort of functional framework. But as an active manager, you're going to incorporate it and find opportunities to incorporate it. And it just might simply mean that, yes, there's more volatility, but you're going to have to be more convicted and have longer holding periods. So there are two different things here. There's one about the treasury possibly buying back debt. And then there's investors acting as liquidity providers and stepping in in the all-to-all and disintermediating banks. Is that what you're saying that if the banks were not necessarily the ones that were there and you had a platform where you could really make markets in real time, that that would possibly be a more effective way of providing liquidity to this market? Well, I think liquidity in general isn't necessarily a democratic process. And so when you think about it, there's different layers of liquidity within the marketplace. And we're suggesting you see, if you have more degrees of freedom, then maybe perhaps that's better for the market liquidity as you go for it. It doesn't necessarily mean that people have a view or a more constructive view or a less constructive view of where the market is headed. The market is the market. But when we think about it, that broader base landscape is we're really trying to head in that regard. Meanwhile, the Bank of America Fund Manager survey showed that investors are holding the highest cash piles going back to 2001. And we hear that from everyone. Cash is your friend. Do you want to be liquid? Do you want to be nimble? Is your experience that's just flooding in that people are coming to you and basically just saying, please, give us anything you can to give us a sense of what our income could be, how to be safe, and you're overwhelmed or is it not really the case? You know what the problem is, Lisa, is that people are focused on looking and driving in the rearview mirror. And the reality is, is that as you're thinking about where it is to come, they're so focused on what has happened in the past one to two quarters. They don't necessarily have the ability to look out the front window and see the opportunity set that perhaps that cash and more importantly, fixed income provides in this landscape. One of the concerns that you have is obviously growth. One of the concerns you have is sort of does the risk parity element of having interest rate exposure duration offset some credit risk taking and broader risk taking with inequity markets. And maybe those correlations don't hold at this moment. But if they do reemerge, then there's some different opportunities that's in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4230,2022-10-18 12:39:31
15885," Correlations don't hold at this moment, but if they do reemerge, then there's some different opportunities that's in the higher rate environment we're finding in right now is actually the setting of the table or something that is very different than we had for the past few years and decades. Let's build a natural right. So don't keep looking in the review mirror ultimately. In that review mirror is not just two quarters, it's a decade worth of zero rights, negative rates, QE. When I hear you talk and I get the sense that you think this is something that's going to hang around, well, just one year, 12 months, this is something we need to adjust to. It's going to be unlikely that we get back to a zero rate level for, you know, in a flat, you'll curve like we've been witnessing as a two-year note at 25 basis points seems to be something that's out in the past. But what I do think is going to happen is that when you see where we are, at least for the next one to two years, a higher inflationary print when you're a PCE that might level out about 3.5% is that closer to 2%, that means front and rear rates are probably going to be in this vicinity for some period of time. And investors should be comfortable with that in that notion. Obviously, it has on set effects of what happens with equity markets risk taking and things like that. But fundamentally, this is a higher rate level and investors need to think about the value of fixed income in this environment, not just because of higher rates, but because of its complimentary effects to total portfolio. Well, that's where I wanted to go. To short-term guy, let's go, we can long-term. Does the actual assumption shift? We've been going from 8% to 6% good news in terms of cash imputing to plans? Are we going the other way now where we're going to have a higher, actual, or an assumption of our retirement plans? Yeah, Tom. Ultimately, investors are going to look for different sources of how to produce total return. What we've focused on is declining interest rates happened over the previous three decades, with simply that lower rates spread on higher capital appreciation opportunities. That calculus has fundamentally changed. And so the total return composition is not just on capital appreciation. It's on the ability to carry an income, whether it's through dividend income or income from bonds in the traditional sense. And that is quite honestly one of the things that investors who are maybe new to the market, so the past decade or so, need to be thinking about. So a lot of factors are putting us back into a more traditional 1970s, 80s, and early 90s mindset. Not only how to trade markets from a liquidity perspective, but also how to think about constructing portfolios. When was the last time we sat around a table together? Isn't this nice? For a while, it's lovely. It's good to see you. It was more and more. In town for the Yankees TK. No, no, no. Just plenty of plenty of that. Just happens that Yankees are playing that he's in town. Total coincidence. I'm sorry to be hugely for being in town for the Yankees. No, I'm here to give Turkey advice. Of course. I'm just not a pincoe. Great to see you. TK coming up in the next hour as we can't you down to the open. Just an all-star lineup for you. I'm going to see Barrow of JP Morgan as a management. Great PDs of PGM. We'll catch up with Kate Moore of Black Rock around the opening bow as well. Looking forward to that. We're going to celebrate off the Thursday bottom up 2170 Dow points. That's extraordinary. Quite a rally, eh? That's quite a rally. That's how we look at it. Do you want me to fit in the silence? One minute. Dow points. I'm going away for a few days now. I'm going back to Anna Kahnekami. You're almost going back to Eastman Codec. Is that right? Well, that's part of your total return. What was the stock in Wall Street? What was that code? What was that stock code in Wall Street? Anna Kahnekami. Anna Kahnekami. There we go. Sorry. Sorry. I remember. Can I just point out something? Just not to break this. But there is a talk about issue. It was super special, but I just couldn't take it anymore. So Carnival offering yields of up to 11.5%. I'm $1.25 billion of junk bonds. And to me, this is shocking and exactly what Jerome was talking about. That basically you can get yield in a way that perhaps you couldn't, as long as they don't go out of business. That's a question of, but that's the point. But how does that change to your point, John, the sort of, wait, actuarial assumptions? I think that's fascinating. That's what I'm thinking about. Couldn't take it anymore. You want to frame that? I don't want to frame that. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. What I risked for you on, Lisa, Dalfites. Then I go to Taleb and Schneider here, the rules have changed. We're back to gravity. We're back to a risk-free rate. And it's something a huge body of people aren't familiar with. I'm going to go.

From New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world. With the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. French rail energy and other key workers are striking today to demand a bigger share of corporate profits. It's raising pressure on President Macron to take further steps to ease the impact of surging inflation. There's been protesting in the country and commuters are facing travel disruption on trains and buses, blockades at refineries and fuel depots have led to gas shortages. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has ordered an extension of the lives of the country's three remaining nuclear plants until April 2023. The decision is meant to end a standoff between two coalition partners. The Greens are opposed to nuclear power, but the free Democrats argue Germany should use all the generation capacity available to tackle the energy crisis. And the European Union is unveiling a new emergency package to tackle the energy issue, betting on steps to bolster solidarity among member states. But the block will refrain from immediate gas price caps amid political divisions and concerns over supply. Bloomberg has learned the European Commission was set to propose measures to avoid extreme price spikes in energy derivatives. slogan's attacking president, Xi Jinping, featured on banners on a Beijing bridge last week have spread to other cities in China as well as across the globe. Frazes from the original handwritten banners have criticized strict lockdowns and restrictions that have defined G's COVID-19 zero policy and called for new elections.

Here's what's interesting about Bloomberg employees' Apple's the laying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish and completely...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4232,2022-10-18 12:47:52
15887," I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third-party apps on the App Store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. When you think space, you probably think......one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA. Which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? From the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, Beels and Nellisks, inside, from and above politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. At the end of the day, if you want to attract investors, you need to have the right business model. This review in my mind is all about clarity on the business model. This is what's been in many ways haunting the European banking sector for quite some time. Phil of Hildenbrand, he is a former leader of the Swiss National Bank and of course at BlackRock as Vice Chairman. I'll be honest when he speaks, I take notes. He's that good talking there about European banking and the challenges for. The smartest thing I heard on this show today was from one, Asbasic, who told me that Wells Fargo's price to book was larger than Goldman Sachs. I was stunned by that. Let's do the math. Wells Fargo off the Bloomberg screen. It's a little bit apples to oranges. Let's be careful. Wells Fargo 1.06, Goldman Sach 0.98. Maybe that'll come up here with a good news. Once the market opens in Credit Suisse 0.27. Lisa, the differential's stunning. And this is the reason why the latest headline, the headlunch is keep coming out. The latest one being that Credit Suisse is potentially speaking with Canadian and US banks to raise capital after the October 27th. Restructuring plan comes out. So this has basically been this leaked process. Who's going to be the leader? How are they going to raise cash? What are they going to sell? And it's happening in real time and being priced out of by stock investors. And where is the faith right now providing leadership for some London here on this news is Michael Moore, who joins us with this Bloomberg story. Michael from Yhenneter Fortster, Dignitionary and at Kenning. It's real simple. They're looking for capital. How soon will they find it? Is this today? Is it October? Or will it be a more protracted negotiation? You know, it might depend on where the shares are and how they react to the strategy announcement. We think that if they decide to pull the trigger on this, it could come as soon as the strategy announcement in a little over a week's time. You know, when that would actually be placed as TBD. But you know, ultimately it seems like we have the rough outlines of their strategy, leaning more into wealth, shrinking down the investment best, selling off pieces of that. And then it becomes a math question of how do you pay for it? Exactly. And we've seen them pursue a number of asset sales and then the other option which doesn't look particularly palatable right now, but you have to put it on the table is a capital hike. Do we have any knowledge of whether they do a convertible offering?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4233,2022-10-18 12:52:04
15888, other option which doesn't look particularly palatable right now but you have to put it on the table is a capital hike. Do we have any knowledge of whether they do a convertible offering or they give up equity down the road or will this be a Buffett-like preferred statistic of a big fat single digit number return? We've seen them do convertibles in the past we've seen them do straight equity in the past you know the the regulators have narrowed the definition of what counts in that core CET-1 ratio that all the investors look at so the options are somewhat limited if they want to boost that number but that's kind of what investors are wondering is you know how painful would this one be? Michael what does Credit Suisse after this look like? I think you have you know they lean into they have a strong Swiss business they have a strong international wealth management business and I think they're going to try to lean into that a lot of the problems but not all the problems have come from the investment bank and that's been losing money in recent quarters so you'll you've seen them with the SPG sales process try to sell off that unit or at least pieces of it and kind of shrink the capital that's devoted to the investment bank a lot like UBS did a decade ago how much Michael is Credit Suisse an idiosyncratic story that's based on a series of events that have transpired over the past decade and how much does it represent some of the struggles at a number of European banks that have resisted consolidation that have resisted taking significant measures like what we're seeing Credit Suisse speculate on I think you definitely you know see echoes in another situations there's been a lot of parallels with what Deutsche Bank faced five or six years ago before they you know did a major restructuring you are seeing you know you you pointed out the price to book that's definitely low but it's it's you know not unheard of in Europe you see some of the other big European lenders trading around that point three level and so I think there are you know other struggles across the board but Credit Suisse is definitely the one in the spotlight right now because of some of the idiosyncratic issues. Michael Moore thank you so much and that story just out on the Bloomberg terminal we'll get it out on Bloomberg dot com here in a bit leading our coverage on European banks it just never ends and I just Lisa I just absolutely don't understand to this day and I remember Davos years ago a piercing conversation with David Rubenstein in a panel about the idea of in a nation mergers versus other nation mergers like with Fortis Bank of Belgium years ago and we're no we're no we're neither of those right now. Well and part of this is because of stories like in Germany everyone has their Bundesbank and who's going to vote to have it sort of merged with somebody else right but how much is that a story around the European continent on a broader level we're seeing US banks do really well how much is that going to be sustainable given some of the pushback saying you guys have to give more to savers and the pushback at the same time that they come out and they say well our resilience is what's keeping us going and the reason why we haven't seen some sort of big explosion in markets. The word I would do is festering here let's go to the stock market now with highs for the day futures up 85 2.3 percent down a solid 633 points even the NASDAQ leads the way 2.5 percent is well it's off the bottom but there's so much technical damage I can't call technically through resistance. I'm not I honestly I'm not getting that much of a signal from certain swings that we've seen in the stock market over the past couple of sessions. I am getting a consistent message from the bond market which is that inflation is still prevalent and that you're going to see this federal is able to raise rates more aggressively than people previously thought and as we heard Jerome Schneider as we heard Steve Rochito say where we end up is probably more likely to be a 2% level than a zero percent level that's different. Having talked about it today but on the yield curve we come in negative 44 basis points maybe a little bit better off the tension of last week and the real yield,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4234,2022-10-18 12:56:29
15889," Having talked about it today, but on the yield curve we come in negative 44 basis points maybe a little bit better off the tension of last week. And the real yield was a positive 1.60. We give back a little bit there. It's a little bit, I've used the green spin word, quiescent. Yes, although consistent in where it's been. I mean, 1.5 percent, 1.6 percent for a real yield. This is a game changer for people who have been used to a valuation proposition in equities that is completely different. And so the sort of stability of this contrasts with the whippiness that we've seen in stocks and I'm getting more of a signal from bonds. When did United Airlines? I said this like two hours ago. I said, I'm sorry, that's what's most interesting to me. I don't want to hit you. It's after the market. It's after the market today. Yeah, it's after the market today. I'm sorry, I'm really, really interested what the airlines do here, somewhat like FedEx. We've seen, we've seen from Delta that they've done really well and that they actually outperformed. We're going to doing a Moynihan. And that's basically as a result of business travel coming back, as a result of people using business class. There's a sea just here. And also people who have money have it to spend and they want to try to cross. Yeah, but economy's packed. Yeah, packed. I mean, I, I, I get the elite thing, but I'm sorry, it's a statement about the country has it, we've heard from the banks. Congratulations to Goldman Sachs.

This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together.

To grow your practice and make better use of your valuable time, the difference is Bloomberg Law. At more than 2% yesterday, at more than 2% this morning, life from New York City, good morning, the countdown to the open, starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training, this is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Perra. Life from New York, we begin with the big issue, mounting signs of capitulation. What is happening now is very extreme. Companies are batting down the hatches and getting ready for choppy times. You're seeing very strong bearish trends across multiple asset classes. Broadly bearish outlook for this class. It's something that for most people is very uncomfortable. When I look at the earning analyst estimates, they're still too high. Expectations come down. That should be the next to shoot at drops. We need to see some of that weakness coming through. If you really start thinking about what's on the U.S. economy, the Fed is trying to hike and crack the economy. We've seen the market sell off a lot. If we're not bottoming out, we're finding a bottom. That potential capitulation. Nobody ever nails it on the exact day and if they do, they're lucky. These signs of capitulation are building. That's the read from Bank of America's latest fund manager survey for more. Let's get to Bloomberg's Taylor Riggs. It's always a great survey, John. When you think about capitulation, some of these one-sided trades are what really has been built into the market. A lot of this has been the drop in market liquidity. That the survey has noted the same number that looking at a weaker economy. The inflation that's going to be falling in the next 12 months, 83% looking at global profits to worsen over the next 12 months. All of that is signs of some of these one-sided trades and what is built in. The most crowded trades, John, you could have guessed this, right? Long dollar, long ESG, long oil. Long dollar means short EM and unfortunately short EU equities as well. As you're thinking about some of the economic and recessionary environments on the way as well. Take a look at some of the tail risk, John, because it's always the left tail. The type 2 error, how to not lose money. That is the key focus. As we know, it is all about inflation. It's all about hawkish central banks. What that error might look like. And again, sort of those deep global recessions. What that means for the big Fed pivot and making sure that inflation is under control. If we're also looking at sort of a big inflationary environment, the left tail risk is what you have to look out for. Finally, John, it always comes back to the Fed, right? And some of the big macro outlooks. Where do we see the terminal rate? Where do you see the Fed going to and holding that and pausing before a cut on the end? As you can see, a lot of this has been raising expectations from maybe now four and a quarter, four and a half, even five percent for some big terminal rates here. So that really is going to be the key for the equities going forward. I tell you, that's wonderful. As always, tell the rich there, breaking it down. Michael Hartnan, the team over at Bank of America. And it's the quote for you. It screams macro capitulation, investor capitulation, the start of policy capitulation. It points to the cash level 6.3 percent, the highest since April 2001. With us now, Cassie Barrow, of JP Morgan and P. Jim's, very penis. Cassie, first to you, are we seeing macro capitulation, investor capitulation and the start of policy capitulation? So where I would push back on that assessment is policy capitulation.

15891," assessment is policy capitulation. I think when I look at what's been happening in the guilt market, which has really been driving global market sentiment, the one thing that I really have taken away is that the BOE has never backed down. They are continuing on with QT. We think that's going to happen at the end of the month. And when we look at the big picture, the fundamental data in the US is still suggesting that the Fed needs to continue to push on with rate hikes and QT. What the market has been really struggling with is this risk of financial stability. And this idea that the Fed is going to pause because financial stability risks are rising. And what I would say to that is there's two things here. There's cost of liquidity and there's access to liquidity. Right now with the cost of liquidity, it's going up. That's monetary policy. That's what the Fed and other central banks want. Access to liquidity, you may not like the level that you can raise liquidity, but you can still get it. As long as that access to liquidity is open, central banks are comfortable with financial stability and they can continue on with their path of hiking rates and removing accommodation. Greg Patives, do you agree? Well, so I think it's way too early to say capitulation. I think that's heroic in many different respects. I mean, we're not even close to a recession that everyone's predicting. Once again, basic principles, Jonathan, I have yet to see markets rally, risk markets rally, heading into a recession. So to me, I think it's really quite too early. And as it's been the entire year, hope springs eternal. And everyone's looking for the turn. I've been finding it the entire way. Not fine to get in the banks right now. Just listening to the Wall Street chiefs on the US economy. Greg, this is what they've got to say. Brian Moynihan at Bank of America, consumers are spending. They have money. JP Morgan's Jamie Diamond consumers are in very good shape. Jane Fraser over at City, the US economy remains relatively resilient. What are we learning about now that tells us something about the future, Greg, about the state of this economy and how it can deal with the downturn? Yes, so the underpinnings of the economy here in the US is really quite robust. The consumer is humming along. You know, wages are up, obviously not keeping up with inflation. But the normal growth matters a lot for the economy. And I think we forget that sometimes. So what that means to me, ultimately, is that the Fed has to do more to slow down the man side. And so if anything, this is a good news, bad news story. The good news is the economy is doing well. Consumers are doing well at all. But the bad news is the Fed has to do more in order to call that underlying inflation that comes with it. And so it raises the specter of a hard landing, I think, as a consequence. And, Kasey, you called a recession inevitable. Why is it inevitable? Well, I would agree with what Greg is saying in terms of the Fed needing to do more. And unfortunately, because the Fed needs to do more, they need to keep policy restrictive for longer. The risk of a hard landing in that scenario just goes up. So when I look at the last CPI report, you see, core CPI, 6.6%, but the six month run rate is even faster than that. So we've had 300 basis points of tightening. And inflation is actually still accelerating. So when I look at fixed income valuations right now, I see very high yields, but I see spreads that are still very complacent to that risk of recession. And so, you know, where we're most cautious is on that higher or on that lower quality high yield company that is still going to face a lot of trouble as the Fed pushes on. Kasey, I've said you say a few times. You need to be patient here. Wait for spreads to get to maybe 750. I heard that from your colleague Bob Michael as well. What's special about 750 for high yield spreads? So when we build up to those types of numbers, what we're thinking about is a couple things. One, where we expect defaults to move to in this cycle. But and the second is the concept that markets tend to overshoot. So, you know, even if you think that the default cycle this time around is going to be more modest, we know that likely the market",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4237,2022-10-18 13:09:28
15892," markets tend to overshoot. So, you know, even if you think that the default cycle this time around is going to be more modest. We know that likely the markets are going to overshoot, they're going to go a little bit further in that frenzy of really fully pricing in recession. And so that's the level that we're thinking we're getting to once we combine those two factors. Greg, we have this discussion last week, didn't we? Spreads out screaming recession of 500 basis points. And then it's just really tempting to look at the yield that you can get right now in fixed income and say forget the spread, just buy it. Greg, how do you navigate that particular situation? Well, so you have to bifurcate the risk. I think that's what's happening is that investors are looking at the overall yield, which is a repricing of the risk-free and even the liquidity in the market place. Credit spreads themselves remain arguably pretty tight. So they're just above the average average. That 75800 on high yield parkings back to time when once spreads get past 800 basis points, high yield investors have been rewarded historically for entering the fray. But I think it's really interesting that investors are complaining the yield versus spread risk. And so yield are up. That's great news, absolutely. But you haven't seen a repricing in the cyclical part of the market, the fall risk part of the market. And so I think spreads are still too tight here. When do you expect to see that adjustment, Greg? And what's going to get us there? What's going to lead us towards that further adjustment in fixed income towards what you just explained? So I think it's data driven, not surprisingly. It's been fighting the entire time, as I mentioned before. So I think the data has to soften. You have to start to see earnings roll over margins compressed. And so it has to become a fundamental story. So as of right now, it's just been a central bank repricing story, not a fundamental story. So I do think at some point that has to occur, if the thesis is that central banks globally have to hike in order to contain inflation and best slow down the economies into a possible recession, then that has to filter through credit spreads. So I think it's just a matter of time. So I suspect Jonathan over the next three to six months. Features up big time this morning up 2% on ESMP 500, up big time yesterday as well in the equity market. Council, a question for you on the economic data, just looking at the incoming information, maybe looking back to CPI last week. Is this market still responding to the incoming data in a way that you would anticipate? So we've had strong CPI, we have the strong September jobs report. You know, I think what's been mudding the waters a little bit has been the moves in European and UK bond markets, which has been creating a lot of term premium volatility. So one thing that we've been noticing is as the BOE has been repriced, it's caused the belly of the Yield curve to cheapen. And I think that's stopped some of the Yield curve flattening momentum that we've been seeing. I think that's probably coming to an end here. So we've seen a lot of headline ping-pong from the UK, but I think at this point, given what we've seen in terms of the walking back of the budget, a guilt volatility come down and we can see some of that stabilization in global term premium, which can allow the Yield curve in the US to go back to that flattening trend and trade more with the domestic fundamentals, which again, strongly a bar market, a high inflation, the Fed pushing forward with rate hikes, increasing recession risk and that flatter Yield curve. The whole curve shift in lower this morning, Yield to lower by four basis points on a 10 year, 397 on a 2 year down three or four basis points to about 440. Councillor Barra, Greg Peele is sticking with us. Councillor Mentio in the UK coming up, a sharp new term on Truss and Amix. Now I recognise we have made mistakes.

15893," today Is there still room for our economics to be carried out in full in the way that Shenzor Abe imagined it? Does Japan need a new policy? Is that what Kishida has to learn? I think there are probably parts that you could hold on to. I think the main challenge is that the main challenge is the democracy. The population is declining, rapidly aging. Women are totally underused in the labor force, especially educated women. One needs to think about increasing immigration. These are issues that Abe tried to address, but a lot more needs to be done to quote-unquote revitalize Japan. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell. Filling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Now I recognize we have made mistakes. I'm sorry for those mistakes, but I fix mistakes. I've appointed a new chancellor. We have restored economic stability and fiscal discipline. What I now want to do is go on and deliver for the public. We are elected on the 2019 manifesto. I'm determined to deliver on that. The Prime Minister lives trash issuing a meoculper following a U-turn on her economic plan. This coming amid a financial times report saying that Bank of England would also deliver a little bit of a U-turn and push back its plans to start Q-T. The spokesperson denied the report. The team coverage starts right now. Bloomberg Sky Johnson in London alongside Lizzie Perdon. Lizzie, this is getting more embarrassing by the day. It is. Do you mean for the financial times awful is trust? Lizzie, you're taking that job. Bank of England has denied this report. You're excuse me. I used to be a print reporter. The Bank of England has denied this, but I have to say that it may not have yet decided to delay quantitative tightening. It doesn't mean it can't still happen. The problem with it is if they were to delay quantitative tightening, then they can't really be truly getting on with monetary tightening. It makes the bank look as if it's beholden to fiscal policy. Andrew Bailey at the IMF made very clear that he wants to get on with the job of inflation fighting. I was speaking to a former Bank of England policymaker last week. Interestingly, he was saying he pointed out that the Monetary Policy Committee isn't voting on this QE measure, QT for financial stability. It's a bit of a grey area, the oversight of all of this. It's impacting inflation fighting, so perhaps that's a measure that the Treasury Select Committee needs to have a look at. The Intermediate Range on Sterling again, Cape, or the low, 1256, the high, 114, 10. It's been one of those sessions again, Guy. All over the place. Yeah, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4239,2022-10-18 13:17:59
15894," a range on sterling again, Cape or the low, 1256, the high, 114, 10. It's been one of those sessions again, Guy, all over the place. Yeah, I think increasingly though, this feels less about kind of what we've been worried about over the last few days. Yes, we're a little all over the place. Things have gone, I'm going to take a little while to settle down, but I think the broad brush kind of policy changes have happened. We heard from the Prime Minister, I do wonder, I'll take the other side of what Lizzie said, I do wonder whether the Bank of England is floating tribaloons at the moment. It did so, maybe during the thick of the crisis, when it talks about maybe extending the assistance that it was going to offer. And now maybe we've got some commentary around the possibility of QE being, QT, sorry, being delayed. So I just wonder whether there is something going on here, it doesn't look particularly good for the FT, but nevertheless, I do wonder whether the Bank of England is just testing the temperature here. In terms of the ranges, yeah, I think they're calming down. I was talking about Rome again on our race team talking about what is happening here. Looks like the two year probably the rally we've seen there is sort of fizzling out a little bit. I think you're probably seeing that across the curve, John. I think probably the situation in the UK is past its most volatile moment. I certainly hope that it is. You hope, did you see the U-Gov poll this morning, a couple of hours ago. Most Tory members say Liz Truss should resign. Next line, Dennis. Boris Johnson is the most popular successor. Lizzie Berden, can I get your response to that U-Gov poll early this morning? Well, we knew that Liz Truss was in office, but not in power. Interestingly, now two newspapers have stopped backing Liz Truss, so even the right wing press is turning against her. But she is almost safe in the knowledge that no Tory MP wants a general election, as that U-Gov poll would suggest. They can't decide which candidate should take over from a Sunak, doesn't want to serve and a more than, doesn't want to serve and a Sunak, Hunt says that he doesn't want the leadership at all, even though more than and Sunak both look like they were auditioning for the top job in the Commons yesterday. And even if they could choose who would take over from Truss, the whole process of how to get there is even more hazy. So Truss at least can feel like she's safe for a little bit, but maybe there'll be another crisis which would jog them into action. That seems to be the only thing that could rock the boat at this stage. She just seems to be willing to delegate to her other ministers as long as she can cling on. What am I, Ms? Guy Johnson, Lizzie Berden, the two of you fantastic as always. Guy Johnson will pick things up in about 40 minutes from now. Cassie Barrow, the lesson to the last couple of weeks, looking over to the other side of the pond. What are they? Well, I think that the two things that I've taken away from this crazy move that we've seen is that one, this term premium is not going away. So even though we've seen this walk back in the mini budget, we are not seeing a subsequent retracement in yields to the same extent that we had pre the announcement. And at the same time, I think the other thing, it is on the Bank of England and they're continued resolved towards QT. So we think that QT is still going to happen at the end of the month, but they may do a little bit to help us out. We think that they may tweak QT a little bit to put less pressure on the long end and do a bit of a twist QT to help out the market and alleviate some of the pain in the long end. Greg, would you go with that, too? Yeah, I do. I still think it's very much about isolated events here. I know many market participants are trying to think, is this a playbook for other jurisdictions, other central banks? I don't think that's the case. I think that's completely off to be honest with you. You look at what's happening here in the US, we're entering midterm elections, which is not really being talked about. I don't expect less fiscal coming out if there is a turn in the House and or Senate. So to me, this is very isolated, but it's really difficult to get confidence back. And I think the UK is on the steady.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4240,2022-10-18 13:22:37
15895," and or Senate. So to me, this is very isolated, but it's really difficult to get confidence back. And I think the UK is on this steady decline, unfortunately, and this is just one episode in that. Well, for a moment, Greg, it was the terror wag in the dark, and it shook some things up in USIG as well. Did you take any advantage from what was taking place in the last couple of weeks off the back of how this one materialized? Yeah, so I mean, that was the story. So with the UK LDI online, liquidity that was needed and selling pressures that we've seen globally, right? So I mean, the cloud pull was outside the UK. It was in Europe and the US, and so we saw lots of bid lists and unwinds. So yeah, so technically, we and other did take advantage of that. And so I think that's the lesson here in that you want to have enough liquidity to take advantage of these episodic events that actually kind of present opportunities. So we don't think it's over. We still think there's asset allocation changes, more to come on the UK LDI front. And I think that's the opportunity set, not these broad sweeping macro plays, but more of these idiosome critic moves. Councillor, did you agree? Did you do the same thing in the last few weeks? Volatility, it's hard, but it does also create opportunity and opportunity for alpha for active managers. So we have absolutely been taking advantage of the swings and markets of the risk on and the risk off the periods that we have dislocations in order to find attractive opportunities and take advantage of them. And to do that, you need to have a nimble active stance. You do need to have some cash available on hand to take advantage of those moments. But this is a market for active bond managers. Councillor Paro, great painless to the turf. You're just brilliant as always. It's a very best and fixed income as we march towards the up and about just a monster move in the equity market. And the data pretty decent too. Upside surprise on industrial production, month over month up 0.4%, the survey 0.1, manufacturing production up 0.4%, the survey 0.3, futures up by more than 2%.

She's not a bad side back with us for more and she's not early they've met that challenge. I think we have to define challenging here You're looking at trading figures up 11% fixed income higher than everybody else on Wall Street by a percentage jump basis and equities by revenue Higher than its peers now remember Morgan Stanley has traditionally led that business JP Morgan won it last round But now you're looking at Goldman take a little more share when you look at the equities business in a down market Even with investment banking revenues down 57% you have to look at advisory also that is coming in at Nearly a billion dollars, which is pretty remarkable for an environment like this It's really debt underwriting that missed on expectations, but you have to ask all the banks here How much risk are they willing to take on and do we have to watch when Investment plans gets crunched down in the wake of a very challenging environment as we've been talking about look at this revenue Break down pretty remarkable here as well because consumer and wealth now accounting for 20% of the business Consumer revenues alone came in a hundred million dollars more than had been expected now in the reorganization What does that look like what they've telegraphed as consumer operations are aligning a little bit more with the technology focus businesses They have that Apple partnership. They're focusing on transaction banking wealth is being brought in to asset management a new line of leaders and being elevated and a big change ahead for Goldman Sachs as we look to the reorganization But no new targets yet set for those businesses here are those come by numbers there We've been talking about it the competitive pressure is on you mentioned it this morning Goldman's head count is up 4% So to the extent that you're seeing that crunch on Wall Street jobs It's there, but it's not there in full.

We still have a lot of monetary policy tightening ahead of us So I think the way to think about this is a bear market rally. It's it's short. It's sharp It still matters, but the big picture hasn't changed and there's still work to be done I think before we can say this bear markets over Okay, more of Blackrock echoing that view and keeping her cash stockpiles",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4243,2022-10-18 13:35:29
15898," big picture hasn't changed and there's still work to be done. I think before we can say this bear markets over. OK, more of BlackRock echoing that view and keeping her cash stockpiles high. She writes the following, the weakening economic environment and tied to financial conditions create an unfavorable setup and we are not adding to equities yet. We have built a substantial balance of dry powder as a hedge in preparation for any macro inflection points in 2023. OK, I'm pleased to say join this right now. OK, it was going through the checklist of yours, management commentary on labor, capex, supply chain management for earning so far. What are you learning? You know, I think we still have to get through the book of earnings, John. We haven't learned that much yet. But it's going to be really, really challenging. Look, we have a world of economists out there who are all trying to sort through the data to look into their crystal balls and forecast next year. And then you have corporate management teams who are saying, hey, my experience in the third quarter was not nearly as bad as I thought. You know, one data point, not necessarily related to earnings that I really love, because I love reading these a CFO surveys and the Richmond Fed, Duke Ku Klow CFO survey, which was released for third quarter data, had some interesting tidbits. And one of them was companies did not report any deterioration in their own conditions second quarter to third quarter. It was actually still relatively elevated. And while there's a big gap between how companies think about the economy going into 2023 and how they feel about their own businesses, that gap is persisted for a couple quarters. So there's not been a big deterioration. And I think it's going to be hard for companies to sort of give us strong guidance one way or another when there are so many macro variables that are uncertain as Andrew Sheets was just mentioning in that clip you played. OK, it's something about what we can learn about the president, what it tells us about the future. And I'll build on that. This is what we're learning about the president from Wall Street Chiefs. Why not have a bank for America says consumers are spending? Diamond at JP Morgan says consumers are in very good shape. Jane Fraser at Citi says the US economy remains relatively resilient. What that's telling most people is that we're in a situation where there isn't a ton of excess. There's not much fragility. And if we get it down, turn it won't be a bad one. Now, what I heard this morning, Kate, that was interesting for Andrew Sheets and Morgan Stanley said, yes, maybe in GDP, but perhaps not in earnings. Could you build on that? Do you think there's a clear distinction there that might emerge that we need to pay a bit more attention to? Yeah, I think it's a really good point. Look, we would always like to take GDP and our forecast for GDP and map it against earnings. But the truth of the matter is, is that over medium-term periods and even over short-term periods, the correlation between GDP growth and earnings growth is very, very light in some cases non-existent. There sometimes is a better correlation or relationship between revenue growth, the top line, and GDP growth. But companies have a lot of levers to pull and use in order to engineer better earnings. And I would expect if revenue growth, meaningfully, weekends, and the inflationary pressures across a whole variety of goods and services don't ease, companies will do things like reduce headcount, slow down investment in different parts of their businesses that are not as profitable, all to protect the E. So you can have a weaker economic environment and actually a solid earnings environment. And John, something you and I've talked about before that's also really important is the composition of the US equity market, which is some of the companies that are most important on the earnings side are less economically sensitive than say smaller parts of the overall market cap for some of these indices. So let's fold that into the inventory story. We've heard from Target, from Nike, from Micron, potentially GM and Ford according to UBS. Okay, how influential is that kind of story to the way you think about this equity market more broadly? Yeah, one of the challenges I have, John, is you have some of these companies talking about more difficult inventory environments. They have overordered or they got too much of one seasonal good and they're gonna look to liquidate. Now, on one hand, I'd say like that's great for holiday shoppers, maybe great time to take advantage of deals. On the other hand, it's pretty hard to take the examples or the stories from specific companies and extrapolate it out to the entire industry group even though sometimes that's how the market's trading. Sometimes it's very specific around the ordering, the purchasing and the price and sales of that specific company and not about all of the consumer. You mentioned a moment ago, John, how many data points from financial services, from credit card data, all the suggestions and the consumers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4244,2022-10-18 13:40:05
15899," company and not about all of the consumer. You mentioned a moment ago, John, how many data points from financial services, from credit card data, all suggesting the consumer is still in quite good shape. Yeah. And that's our expectation as well. So Kate, you talked about the macro-inflation points in 2023. That the dry powder for now was for next year. Why is that? Why is next year the thing penciled in on the calendar and not the last few months of this year? Well, the truth of the matter is, John, we have a lot of high conviction equity holdings in the portfolio. So it's not as if we have cut all of our risk and just said, we're going to wait into the first quarter of 23. What we do own, we think is like, store our strong companies with huge free cash, low potential, we'll be able to maintain their margins through a tougher inflationary environment. But we've balanced that out with more cash so that we can be opportunistic. I agree, you know, to the clip earlier with Andrew Sheetz, this is more likely a bear market rally than something that sustained. And while multiples have become more attractive, there's a lot of question around the E and you can't say the market is unequivocally cheap at this point. So I think we'll be averaging our way into companies we like and we want to hold for longer periods of time. But there's no rush to say, you know, we're breaking out here into a new bull market. Okay, I wanted to finish with a quote from Mark O'Claanovich over at JP Morgan. This is what he had to say. We trim the size of both our equity overweight and bond underway, but remain overall overweight equities and commodities versus underweight bonds. This is the line I'd love your feedback on. A commodity overweight continues to serve as a hedge for geopolitical risk and inflation. And we stay long the dollar as a hedge to a hawkish fed. Can I pick up on the first piece of that last line? Okay, your thoughts on a commodity overweight as a hedge for geopolitical risks and inflation? It's specifically expressing that through the equity market. Yeah, I mean, look, we have a very constructive view on commodities and resources in general and have actually begun to even rebuild some positions where we had taken profits in this space earlier this year or a couple of months ago, I would say. The part that's not in Mark O'Claanovich's note there that's really important is the strong fundamentals for these resource companies. Yes, I think some of the commodity stuff provides a good hedge against macro uncertainty and perhaps some geopolitical risk. But we're also talking about companies that have very, very, very strong balance sheets. In fact, almost no debt with a supply demand balance is very strong where there are secular tailwinds in terms of the transition to new energy and the metals and resources that will require or required for that transition. So there's a lot of fundamental reasons. In addition to the geopolitical and sort of volatility reasons, you'd want to own that space. Okay, awesome to hear from you as always. Let's catch up before the end of the year. I'm sure we will. Came more of BlackRock there. But 10 minutes into the session, it agrees up 2% on the S&P. The NAS that cut by 2.2% really big 2 day gain on the S&P 500 to kick off this trading week. So we've heard from Kate Moore called it probably a bear market rally. Andrew Sheetson Morgan Stanley probably a bear market rally. And Aaron Brownepimko said this. I absolutely would fate it. I think that the market right now is just coming off of, you know, very strong weakness over the past week. We see a little bit of a relief rally this morning, but I wouldn't extrapolate that this is, you know, going to last a very long time. I still think that there's significant challenges ahead as we turn the corner into early next year that the market hasn't digested yet. Earnings estimates are too high. Margins expectations are too high. And they don't think that equities are still, you know, seeing the same from the same him book that we see in the fixed income markets. Pushing back against this equity market move, the S&P still higher by about 2 percentage points. Up next on this program, the Biden administration looking to take more action on gas prices. He's worked so hard to get those gas prices down by more than a dollar a gallon from the highest, the highest points that we have seen just a couple of months ago. And he'll continue to work on that.

My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio. And it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investible universe you look at the private markets and it's significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly. The democratization of the private markets to the retail investors. And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. It's a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it into the average investor. How did Jeff Bezos realize you could sell anything on the internet? The web was growing at something like 2300% a year. Anything growing that fast is going to be big. Why did Bill Gates create control all the lead? Kind of become the poster child of hate couldn't you have made this stuff a little simpler. And what inspired Diane Von Firstenberg to create the rap dress? The rap dress created me. On the David Rubenstein show I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders right here on Bloomberg. We understand that there are challenges that are in front of us here in this country. That is why the president has taken action to lower costs. He's worked so hard to get those gas prices down. And he's been working on it for more than a dollar. The highest point we have seen just a couple of months ago. And he'll continue to work on that. President Biden looking to lower prices at the pump with mid-term just three weeks away. There's some recent reporting from Bloomberg. Revealing plans of another strategic reserve release to the tune of 10 to 15 million boughs of crude. Jennifer Jacobs, Jennifer DeLouin, Ari Natter, our colleagues are saying that they're going to announce. Kind of re-announce the pending release of that 10 to 15 million boughs which is left over from the 180 million that they announced in the spring. Now the big question would be whether they add stuff on top of that. Either a new release or something else to make it look like they're going farther than they've gone before. Remember in the spring that 180 was supposed to get us till fall when they said the private sector production would sort of you know catch up and fill that million boughs a day gap. So of course after what has come since then is that OPEC plus production cut and it looks like they're kicking tires on what to do next. One of the economic aids, Jaren Birdstein, lean pretty heavily over the weekend to the possibility that this is coming down the pipe. Now of course the mid-terms are the backdrop here. Jaren you know this, the gas prices are ticking up a little bit and poles tend to pretty closely track voter sentiment with gas prices when...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4246,2022-10-18 13:48:25
15901," The midterms are the backdrop here. John, you know this, the gas prices are ticking up a little bit and polls tend to pretty closely track voter sentiment with gas prices. When gas prices go up, voters get mad at the president. So definitely a political lens to this one as they try to, in their view, stabilize the oil market at least. Josh, as you know, the SPRs at a four decade low is a conversation taken place down in DC about how exposed this might leave US energy security next year. Beyond the midterms, if this gets drained down any further from here. A little bit of one, but not much. When I referred to Bernstein's comments, he went out his way to say, look, it's still more than half full. So we have a little bit of wiggle room here still that they want to use it now. If it's just that 10 to 15, John, essentially again, they're just re-announcing or committing to going to the full 180 that they'd announced in the spring. That's probably different kettle of fish than if they really go above that 180 number. But as you know, Republicans have started to sort of circle around this. And so we'll see whether they go at this particular issue. Go by in another which has room to go still with draining the SPR, but it's kind of unclear how far he'll go without further sort of pouring gas in the fire that you talk about saying, hey, this isn't for this. A Josh, also going to catch up, buddy. As always, Josh Winkrowed down at DC into Josh's point. Separately, we're still considering weighing limits on exports of fuel in the United States too. The internal deliberations I understand continue. President Biden downplaying the odds of a recession. The view from Bloomberg economics say it's 100 percent going to happen for a US recession to take place in the next 12 months. And I won't join this right now from Bloomberg economics. And I won 100 percent going to happen in the next 12 months. Why? Well, in our model. So we see a significantly increased in probability of recession compared to our last update. When we did our last update in August, it was only 65 percent. So what drove this increase in probability? Three factors. In housing, we saw a sharp fall in housing permits as sales fall and construction companies decided to hold off on building more houses. Second, tightening financial conditions. The two-year, 10-year spread has widened. Also, we see widening and high yield spreads. Also, the third factor is just that households now have a poorer outlook about the future. Whenever they do that, that they will start to increase their savings to plan for rainy days, pulling back, spending, and today. And where are you and the team on the depth of said recession? Because what we often hear on shows like this one is short and shallow. Short and duration, shallow and depth. What are you guys saying? Well, our baseline is still short and shallow, just because we do see a lot of buffers still. For example, I told you before the state and local government have a lot of cash. We are estimating up to possibly $780 billion. But then I do think that there's a risk that this could be a deep one, too. Just because that the number one single best predictor of how deep a recession is, is how long the duration of the recession. And usually when the Fed fails to cut rates early on, if the Fed does hold the rate higher for longer and decide not to cut in 2023 despite a recession, that could extend the length of a recession. And if that's the case, then it's possible that this recession, judging by the cumulative decline in GDP, could be rather deep. And a one of Bloomberg economics, that note yesterday got a ton of attention. Equities right now are 2% on the S&P. And that's right now up 2.27%. A lot of Fed speed coming up a little bit later. You get it from Bostic, from Cash Carry. Might be key. It's got to break that down. Morning, Mike. Morning, John. Well, the problem for the markets is for years, the Fed said we're not going to raise rates until inflation goes over 2%. Right now, they're saying we're not going to cut rates until inflation starts to come down. But that's not a measure. How long is that going to take and how far are they going to do, the markets are flying blind? Now, we know that policy works with a leg. You can see there that every time the Fed raises rates, inflation took a while to start coming back down. And it wasn't until we had a recession that that happened. So is that what we're going to have to see this time? We do have a busy week of Fed speak. A lot of people on the calendar. But here's the problem.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4247,2022-10-18 13:52:56
15902," a recession that that happened. So is that what we're going to have to see this time? We do have a busy week of Fed speak. A lot of people on the calendar, but here's the problem with the calendar. A lot of those are introductory remarks, welcoming remarks, things like that. There's only a few people who are speaking actually about the economy going forward, including Cass Carrey today, as you mentioned. Charlie Evans Wednesday, Patrick Harker on Thursday. We do get the Facebook on Wednesday, but what's the thing those three haven't common? None of them are voters this year. So the markets are going to have to go into the blackout period, not really knowing what the Fed is thinking about a terminal rate. They figure 75 for this meeting, but not a terminal rate. And here's what the market is reflecting there, that now we go up to 4.9%, basically 5% for a terminal rate. But two year forwards don't come down. They really stay up high because nobody really knows where this is all going. Mike McKay, one final question. President Bostet, he just speak today, contributing to the ongoing Fed ethics scandal of the last year or so. Mike, what have we learned about his personal situation, that particular situation, and what it means for the overall story for the Fed Chair? Well, basically, he assigned his trading to a third party who did not pay attention to the blackout rules and traded during those periods. He also miscalculated what his earnings were on his reporting forms. And so he had to admit that and correct all those. It doesn't seem like a huge issue, because he didn't know these trades were being made during the blackout. But it does add to the sense of what's going on at the Fed, which can't be good for their credibility. But the optics, not good at all, over the last year for this Fed. That's for sure. Mike, thank you, buddy. Looking forward to the Fed speaking. I think many of you are looking forward to the quiet period as well, the stars. Like I said, this weekend, let's get you to say to price action with a big move higher under way on the S&P up by 1.8%. Here's Abby. And, John, we do have the S&P 500 up about 2%, up nearly 5% over the last two days, the best two days that we have had going back to October 4th, leading the way some of those growth sectors, including materials, discretionary tech and dust trails, on bottom, interestingly, energy is higher, but it's underperforming as oil's down. Now, over the last five days, it's a big risk on time, especially for financials, leading the way up 6.5% really showing you that investors are pleased with earnings, communication services, tech, discretionary, basically your mega caps, they are doing great. Yields down, we have all these big stocks up. Abby, awesome. Thank you. What a run. The Nasdaq 2, the Nasdaq by more than 2 percentage points. Monday, Tuesday, will these gains stick up next your turning to our real life from New York? This is Bloomberg. heute. How much of a push have you seen from the Kishida government in terms of green funding? The Kishida administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Kishida's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework that's reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have a income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4248,2022-10-18 13:57:26

So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. 25 minutes into the session, stocks up, yields down, equities advanced by 1.6% on the S&P, at 1.8% on the NAS. Thank you, bond market taking shape. Looks like this, 2s, 10s and 30s, yields lower by 3 or 4 basis points on a 10 year, 397 on a 2 year, down by 3 or 4 basis points to about 440 after breaching 450 in last week's session.

Is there still room for our binomics to be carried out in full in the way that Shinzo is facing? Does Japan need new policies that what Kishida has to learn or are there parts of this that he should hold on to? I think there are probably parts that he could hold on to, I think the main challenge with Japan faces is demography, the population is declining, rapidly aging, women are totally underused in the labor force, especially educated women, one needs to think about increasing immigration, these are issues that I'll be trying to address, but a lot more needs to be done to quote and quote revitalize Japan.

15904," Pepsis number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more than ever. Pepsis number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country, it's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines, they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion, it had been rolled out in America to great success and so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems, they thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Look for the winning number in Thai Thai for a 7-day Alfonso TV million newspapers, you could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100 so a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi, parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi's sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and the Garbled Facts had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. The problem was 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4250,2022-10-18 14:05:38
15905," The latest winning number, 349. The problem was 349 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns, so there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 349, just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps, 349, 349. Some people had 10 lucky 349 bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets, celebrating. They thought their problems were over, they were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps, but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant, but it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition and Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said, Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants in order to destabilize the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favor. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it, but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4251,2022-10-18 14:09:57
15906," a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Delphiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Delphiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Delphiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. I learned that they could build up their hair on Pepsi and for people who might be the food. So he had mounted that on that phone the other day. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for the five. And another heating for the branch one for the three times a month. Also there was a time my father was hospital. To do heart failure. Still he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to the next one. My father passed away on January 13th, then after staying for almost one year in the hospital he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to their documents about this but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those good world payments but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4252,2022-10-18 14:14:17
15907," turning to our normal life in poverty in the middle. Music When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. The air following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echoed far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news in every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered mind of the attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. Music My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Music Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. The other reason for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically with such high prices, they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special and Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic there to chance to go really far or maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day, was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. As always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day, we're heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the center of Dortmund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4253,2022-10-18 14:18:34
15908," We're heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus of Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with, he called me and said, turn on the TV that was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, it was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. They had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man, suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something is right here. The person to make money off of that had required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for paulers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Binaigord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4254,2022-10-18 14:23:04
15909," Left wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W, stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place, that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, the successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely abackfired. The attacker, Sergei Winnigold, didn't make any money, in fact. He lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Winnigold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Winnigold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Winnigold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Winnigold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Winnigold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Winnigold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4255,2022-10-18 14:27:33
15910," The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. According to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, a way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence as a state. Right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, and really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around 100-ish meters. And it depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumacher-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets 1 kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large 1 kilometer near-Earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They, number in the billions, most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4256,2022-10-18 14:31:42
15911," Our solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population though that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots. Just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is fairly quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this has a business. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. The neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it does. It only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous. That when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Cmon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and come here with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4257,2022-10-18 14:36:07
15912," Absolutely, since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point, you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a second, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore, it deserves more attention or more time to spend on for redefining how it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them when they're decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last year's already in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply pop into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about just nudge it off. It's path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. So it's kind of like bowling, if you will. If you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer, though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft. And it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and then letting the pressure of lights or perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors. And also, we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger, I think, comes from the objects we don't know about. And not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and climate change is a problem with the global commas. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's model. And nobody takes ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining in the future. Maybe he likes a small satellite around the Earth that are always going and looking out for it. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in.

15913,"beeping The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Some chose to binge watch Netflix. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. But for millions of others, they wanted to uproot the financial industry. I just stuck it on up and take 50 dollars a dollar. Here's a stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue their heads spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This isn't a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. It is an investor nowadays. You don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York in Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok Fin influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, Finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. Even today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. And the federalities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world, they look down their nose. And that's kind of accounts that I don't.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4259,2022-10-18 14:45:04
15914," trades of the world. They look down their nose, it does kind of accounts that I don't want a thousand dollar account to just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019 they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remaining doors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of the Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, you know, checking their phones in between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade and so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's done. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives or means, you know, people telling rumors to each out there to beat around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4260,2022-10-18 14:49:00
15915," progresses as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're gonna buy an option for a stock, you think it's gonna go up. It's a call. So think of it like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is a back to scope in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at a price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word, because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some of the attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're gonna watch and get to stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for why stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of, you know, squared the circle, so to speak. And started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time. And others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live, but there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Fets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. Okay. Well came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think roaring kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. And in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4261,2022-10-18 14:57:37
15916," is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner, pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets, or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Yeah, roaring kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in buying at the highs. They're saying keep going and it was working too until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls of institution, artist-powered, full as maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Teniv and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin, or entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4262,2022-10-18 15:01:51
15917," So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that Patan go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers, or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet. Because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speed, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. You have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4263,2022-10-18 15:05:55
15918," If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running it about $119 a month through $130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded, but we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much of your video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art, fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She earned her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. Not quoting the data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. Even large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4264,2022-10-18 15:10:41
15919," For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. When moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Speaking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now, they're a bigger city, but there is a city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to, it's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. So, Thank you. Thank you. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables are the leads. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4265,2022-10-18 15:14:43
15920," to grow beyond that, you are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration. The source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of cash. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the car system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, cars remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the car system, constitute almost 1-5th of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student to teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana Social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Talk to the parents, talk to the teachers, talk to the students, stay in the schools, and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms, and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation. And language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. The result of the decision is also, okay, I am fine with the new meetings. As far as the world is concerned, I am fine with the decision. Hey, how are you? I seem to find time here and have a good view. I find the best. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating which reminds you of very painful past, I think, or that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that. But that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state. W stands for welfare. Aero. S.W. And then Aero is Swero. So the idea is that your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, you say, I am a Swero. And I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4266,2022-10-18 15:18:57
15921," So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, I am a swear-o and I aim to be a doctor. I am a swear-o. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a swear-o. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a swear-o. I want to be a very good actor or, you know, musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of swear-oism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any poorest of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form-leberer. Her parents, the angels, are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowl-Edo-D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We've got a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games. We have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy, we have handball academy. So, we have, you know, Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced gold for all. Gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students. So, the top, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally. Because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country. To put it in one word, the sole aim of introducing all these go-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are directly involved on this vehicle. Their stereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University, and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostels, the hostels which were managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4267,2022-10-18 15:23:27
15922," No good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostels, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. In the universities, there were in those days I am talking about. So the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for social cause and social drive. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day in and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think I will be in future but this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. I think I will be in future. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world. Starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. An inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant for cool water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage. Compare to your traditional X.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4268,2022-10-18 15:27:13
15923," of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. The things they are, more than a third of the world's electricity, could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today, Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. For example in Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect. And on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your heat island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just a clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slow down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4269,2022-10-18 15:31:56
15924," just a clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore, unfortunately, this is a limited option but in the long run, it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. They will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city, the water, the movement of people in the city. We can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development system that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and urban design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very liable city in the future even more than today. Time's a tough job. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. Seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4270,2022-10-18 15:35:49
15925," And I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like, I hit my first day that I broke a grant. And I was like, this is actually going to be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be when the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS? There was like things that I learned about the game. And then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content. And people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people look at a seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else. Or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad. Or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay the certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it. The time of year where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19 companies weren't spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for Click per Thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows, don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. And I first started off Patreon was really the only option, but the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4271,2022-10-18 15:41:09
15926," that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bands you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have the right to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used to get you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies. You remember those? I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think stay with you, you have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you gotta make it a little more exciting. All right, throw in a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment? I think the real most important thing is, is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's gonna be great, you're probably gonna burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right?

One person shows up every 30 minutes says, hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff, because it takes a while, and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Thea and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about, you know, only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So, it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So, it uses these super apps, what we call, that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So, with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice. Nice, neutral, beautiful print, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is item 1. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates the things and say, call this number or something.

15928," Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things and say call this number or something, but the live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very, very big difference. It causes different psychology and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of actually engaging someone else. When you shop actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to the screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba added a live streaming function in early 2016? In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold via live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows and over 65% of them shopped at least one via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. The millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people deserve to interact with. And then live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in their sense of losing control especially during the pandemic. It's the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boost their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming via. She is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of her platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king is Li Jiaqi. We'll widely know as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipstick on himself when he's on the show. Live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany, still earn a good income through sales commissions. If I say that from the beginning, the main streamer is much higher than normal. But the main streamer's career is very deep and has a lot of experience. Every day, when you need to be in a good mood, you'll get a lot of chances to win 5-6 hours. And when you win 5-6 hours, your brain is not stable. Your mouth is not stable. Your hands are not stable. Your eyes are not stable. Like we did before, we didn't just do single-legged live streamers. We still have some options to do. We still have some other things to do in the streamer's life. We still have some other things to do in the streamer's life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4274,2022-10-18 15:53:35

15930,"! You can imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for waste to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind, and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steady pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. When companies develop devices and technologies that actually work, is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project, so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undecided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s. After diver, Rano Koeiversari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. It can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back and forth is that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. But there's a sweet spot where we deploy. That's how we stop it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4276,2022-10-18 16:02:40
15931," Just if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy. So around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic battery milliliters and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouthful of recitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installed on existing man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4277,2022-10-18 16:06:29
15932," in 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the flotters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here and in case of a coming storm the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently inner and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Porta Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid and our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-decommissioning rigs or full powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to tell you. I've covered a lot of companies. I've covered a lot of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4278,2022-10-18 16:10:34
15933," Can you please tell me? I'm not going to... I'm not going to... I'm not going to tell you. Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies. I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where, you know, people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan... Please make a move. No, no, no, no, no. I mean, you're... It's so wrong. It's so wrong. One of the most dramatic elements was Riven Dupassi's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. You scared me. You scared Machiavellian. I love these infrastructure. So Raab Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gão. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crime by Carlos Gão. And he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Riven Dupassi. I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gão saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gão was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gão. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry falling under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gão was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gão came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was that a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gão about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4279,2022-10-18 16:15:07
15934," that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office. and that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto. So after Carlos Gorn was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gorn and he was told get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Dohn did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals, that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinada and his role in Carlos Gorn's downfall. Harinada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very close to Carlos Gorn and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gorn as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Rano and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gorn and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gorn had to go. Harinada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him or did have a long-standing relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just didn't smell right, it just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gorn. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Ravinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point we reported into him. You know, at the time everything was quite as you can imagine it was we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. I'm nice, I'm nice, I'm nice, you're a good...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4280,2022-10-18 16:19:24
15935," Me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money been taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, and great detail backed up by evidence backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just got into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at the global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation in Harinata.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4281,2022-10-18 16:23:37
15936," in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and harinata. What happened to Rob Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title, but it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First time I noticed this was a round mid-march, and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean this is just not normal behaviour. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama? To basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that the... that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed. Which again, I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this isn't a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry not is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well, and continued his work. And he's a career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4282,2022-10-18 16:28:03
15937," of his job at Nissan, be paid very well, and continued his work. A career that he spent 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those, and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own. And you've got to be ready for it. You've got to be ready for it. If you take it on anyway. marketing place where youOYника? This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. Yeah. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera, too. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it seemed to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Shottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shottenstein. And this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just, you know, the sem-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4283,2022-10-18 16:32:25
15938," against JP Morgan and it was immediately clear that there was great story here to be told. So I started just, you know, assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the shot and steam kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences. It was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail. So she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements and she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page and it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, the FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly's signed up for this fund to the tune of about five million dollars over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4284,2022-10-18 16:36:56
15939," And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box and that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five-page handwritten, a memento, a willing trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken, the only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity, honor account. And they ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter still in her place visiting. Donna's there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan, they're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time, I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock and big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his son's weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4285,2022-10-18 16:41:18
15940," You know, kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused, you know, those within. Seem sad, it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep, you know, hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how, you know, a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself, and at the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before, and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero, but the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day, and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys. It became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle-roes suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. And a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the death knell for the pits. In 2005 the IPE closed down and when the pits...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4286,2022-10-18 16:45:27
15941," for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there, lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions, Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenses and there he's you know drinking buddies, some or there he's own kids, friends from football. You know their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent, let's be clear but they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to you know to get into this. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe start to slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a guy which you start accent. You know not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But you know these guys they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves, they went to places like Marbaire on holiday. Thaden Boyce is a very wealthy place, you have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheebride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You know you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glen Cores but it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading and the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. And of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. They are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset the oil. And by oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 1.32pm that's when things start to get...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4287,2022-10-18 16:50:19
15942," continue to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 1.30 p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is a few years later making a one hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When we and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it we couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero sum game anytime you're making money as an oil trade or someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada. They sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega capital traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made in the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set. They were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market which is an incredible thing to think about when you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks you know oil majors BP and Shell and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now but the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group and the law firm was at pains to point out number one they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing that they all try.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4288,2022-10-18 16:54:30
15943," a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately, and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets, based on publicly available knowledge, and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion, and some people will look at what happened and think, that must be dodgy, they all traded at the end of the day, they all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking, but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world, and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really, because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies, they've essentially gone very quiet. Any kind of social media presence they had is closed down. By all accounts there, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. We just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. Potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it, might be, you could be fine, you could be banned from trading, and in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. They would be forgiven to think that we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. The reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory and a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change.

15944," I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions than you are in a sense offsetting your emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves. What we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out. But others would say and those of the Nature Conservancy would say these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here are 20 NERI, the civilized Disney World this year! If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up. Diesel Fuel, they have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So this car.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4290,2022-10-18 17:02:56
15945," in parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are gonna be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's gonna be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4291,2022-10-18 17:07:31
15946," disincentivized projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent you have policymakers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. So the policies end up biasing the whole system, and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop has a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from L.A. to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4292,2022-10-18 17:12:10
15947," More incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1,000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the high-pollute world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats for getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging and requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately, it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 test that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realized that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, watch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. Yeah. We got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. And the number one question we got from investors from project proponents, or just people in general was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4293,2022-10-18 17:16:27
15948," But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a hyperlube safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperlube could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or chest pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a hyperlube and then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperlube development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperlube. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game changing platform here. Those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisiting the ripple effects of what hyperlube could achieve, those are fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point to point, travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperlube companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James. And as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government level business case for 300 kmh conventional high speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh hyperlube. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hyperlube range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds. There's very little commuting traffic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4294,2022-10-18 17:20:17
15949," Let result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester leads. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul, passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air for eight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck orage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverged from one track into two, that makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections. In that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network that in the end will make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent and take Europe for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4295,2022-10-18 17:24:40
15950," Did it magnet? Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high point because you have no movement components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We're already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hearts next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4296,2022-10-18 17:28:53
15951," The next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6-kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 km per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6-mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think, is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright Brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperloop. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.

15952," Our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Stan, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. For Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons, and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself, hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemical's industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called gray hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push in the hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Company Svam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. With that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen before these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4298,2022-10-18 17:37:55
15953," Time and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H.T. demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Lockwa caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen, all the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agribusiness, looking there and saying, why is global warming accelerating, if anything you're saying is true? And then there's no actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. Did I got put to it? Two days ago when JCB really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Fortescue, I mean, a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, it both conspicued well from Fortescue, huge ballot sheets, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD, green with per atom. Right, then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel, hydrogen, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal-fired projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue, hydrogen is cooking the planet. Yeah, you know, hydrogen should not make renewable electricity, it's releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are so farming under the guise of green energy. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for ESG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions, so where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on green hydrogen, that actually this pollution-free all the way to the supply chain fuel has now been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none, that I don't believe any sovereign leader will have any energy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4299,2022-10-18 17:42:20
15954," The supply chain fuel has now been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra seriously, the green hydrogen is never here to stay. It's broken through. The history has been made. It will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidizing, you stop using money into possibly. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates, it could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuel subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also excuses, are never be commercial. They never be supplied into quantities we needed. Now we know, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition, just going from A to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. A to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere. Honestly, well, not that honest because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. It's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now is. So let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now is cheaper. And it's getting more check. It's the only fuel you know. It's just declining in value. You don't have enough of it to power the world. Yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now. Okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Bliberg Green. This is Bliberg Green. This is Bliberg Green.

15955," Excellent. The From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant, and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today is spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25 percent of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. The cost of the carbon dioxide is going to be a lot of pressure coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down? Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some market will still nod the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per meg of an hour. $1,000, $1,600, today, a hundred, and we see it going down to 50 and five years' time and to going down to $25 per meg of an hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships and pipes and really start trading it around the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4301,2022-10-18 17:51:11
15956," Democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's gonna happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and we say a lot faster. What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years. And then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. Big scale in big scale because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're gonna get China in India to stop burning you coal. We have businesses in China and in India and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil of diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's gonna be technology, it's gonna be industry, I think China has committed to a net zero which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 1520 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. And what's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that in October. The International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day. It can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen powered planes at the company summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. We don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. Every day we become more confident. We think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. We need the regulations to be ready. We need the work and collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In the long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4302,2022-10-18 17:55:07
15957," Net Zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg AnyF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Blueburg Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines and this is Blue Brick Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg AnyF Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source and in things like dispatchable power, long call transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to think it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTU's for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. So let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to store ability where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. And that also leads to downside that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4303,2022-10-18 17:59:24
15958," storage, for instance, or just anything where you need the store ability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today, like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caction storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much, Bloomberg, NEF team, on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter at Climate.

Kelsey Barrow is fixing come portfolio manager at JP Morgan Investment Management. I think when I look at what's been happening in the guilt market, which has really been driving global market sentiment, the one thing that I really have taken away is that the BLE has never backed down. They are continuing on with QT. We think that's going to happen at the end of the month. And when we look at the big picture, the fundamental data in the US is still suggesting that the Fed needs to continue to push on with rate hikes and QT. Earnings fast and furious, Goldman Sachs after earnings up now by 3.1%, Johnson & Johnson reported third quarter earnings at beat analyst expectations, but J&J shares down now by 1-10th of 1%.

This is Bloomberg Business Week, inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business, finance and tech news as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week, with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Good afternoon everyone, from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio streaming on YouTube. It is Tuesday, October 18th. Carol Masser, my co-host Tim Stenevick is on assignments. Joining me is host of Bloomberg's surveillance and Bloomberg markets on Bloomberg Radio. Paul Swini, nice to have you here for the ride. Great to be here, always good day to market, so busy day with earnings, so we'll have lots of talk about. We've got Netflix, which is something that you keep a lot of fun. Right, literally infuriatively, so I do watch Netflix, but I've been watching that stock since its inception, and they have upended the media business to say the least, and now everybody is just trying to adapt. All right, we're going to talk about that. We're going to also go through goldmins earnings they were out earlier this morning. We're going to talk about how the Fed is giving Americans a lesson in lag time. I got to say Paul, this is, I love this story. Yes, and that's what economists have been telling us, which is, when you raise rates, it doesn't happen immediately. No. The economists doesn't slow immediately, although the housing market seems to be the first to turn, but you've got to give it some time. Exactly. So we're going to get into that. We're also going to talk about Facebook, a friend, no more of Mark Zuckerberg. We got so much coming up, including a most red, on the extraordinary rise in fall of the COVID billionaires. First up, though, let's get to the market driver's report. Let's set your business week agenda on this. Yes, it's Tuesday, Lemon, Crety Gupta, Anchor and Market's correspondent at Bloomberg and her interactive broker studio, and the amazing Gina Martin Adams, Chief Equity Stragist at Bloomberg Intelligence on the phone from New Jersey. In fact, they're both amazing, and we learned so much about the markets. Crety, let's kick it off with you. We're up, but we're certainly off our highs of the day. Oh, you flatter. You call me Lemon. I speak to everyone Lemon, but it's so sweet. It's like a spring or summer day. It's so much nicer than with Matt Miller, isn't it? Yeah, Matt Miller just talked on it. What does he do? What does he do? When Matt Miller makes fun of me on the air. Today, what did he do today? He shamed me for having a meeting. Yes. And he says, Crety is always in meetings, which I was like, all right, Matt. But it's something new every day. This is our Matt Miller. This is a breath of fresh air. Thank you, Carol. You're welcome. The S&P 500, a sing-a-ferally broad rally. I will say, though, this is not the... That is broad as yesterday? Not as broad as yesterday, which is the caveat here. This is not the two 3% rally you saw yesterday. But still, 1.3% gains on the S&P 500 is nothing to scoff at all. If you had to look at an intraday chart, it almost looks like the stock market went negative, and really it's still up over 1%. Which I think is interesting. It is, however, I think taking its cue more from the earning stories than a day. It is from the bond market or the dollar, which is interesting because in the past, I want to say a couple of weeks, arguably a couple of months, you've had this dynamic where the bond market and the stock market will be bid at the same time. And on a risk off day, both will sell off, as when the dollar will be stronger. That hasn't been the case today. In fact, you see a stock market rallying and a 10-year yield where bonds have actually sold off, and the 10-year yield has gone above 4% at a time when the dollar is about flat. So I think to see that cross-asset...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4305,2022-10-18 18:08:50
15960," your yield has gone above 4% at a time when the dollar is about flat. So I think to see that cross-asset divergence is a takeaway today. Gina, I want to bring you in here. Earnings, they're starting to flow in. We've had some of the banks and then we'll have Netflix today, the tech companies next week. What are you looking for from these companies here? Presumably, some guidance would be helpful as we try to navigate what it means to operate in the post-pandemic world? Yeah, certainly guidance would be helpful, sort of the transition to the post-pandemic world in particular for tech is also very helpful. Recall these were some of the stocks that did. They were the very best of the best performers during the midst of the pandemic and a lot of what's happened over the last year has been sort of this watered fall decline in performance coming back to some sort of new kind of reality. And that certainly has created a significant degree of pressure on prices as well as the earnings streams for these companies. So how are they transitioning? How are they preparing for a new post-pandemic world? And what will that mean for the earnings outlook? It's pretty important for tech. For the rest of the groups, it's really about kind of what is the, how is the economy evolving? How are you navigating the environment of higher interest rates? Still, sticky price inflation, generally flowing activity is a huge question mark for going into 2023. In the short term now, it really is about to be, you know, I think we've been through this game before, many, many times and especially in the midst of periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, stocks do tend to very strongly embrace earnings cues. So in the midst of earning seasons likely saw in second quarter, as long as companies are beating expectations, prices generally reflect that slightly better than expected tone that is normal during earnings season. Hey, meantime, Gina, you guys are out with some research, you and your team and you say the score card still looks outside US for better deals. So, you know, we talk about the US being the cleanest dirty shirt and yet opportunities are really outside the US. Yeah, I think this is really interesting because in the case of earnings, the US is not the cleanest dirty shirt. It's actually the dirtiest shirt in the laundry pile next to China. So when you look at the earnings, try to... Do you have teenagers? No, I'm just kidding. I do not, though, nearly, nearly. So I can relate somewhat. But when you look at the earnings trends, you don't get the support for stocks. I think that the equity market has largely benefit from a flight to quality story that has really played out in currencies because when you exclude the currency impact of equities, you get a fair on equities, you get a very different perspective on performance. And when you look beneath that headline, you look at the traditional drivers of equity performance, like profitability, like earnings trends, like relative valuations, not a single one of them supports the call to move into the US. As a matter of fact, all of those indicators would suggest looking for opportunities emerging outside of the US at this stage. Krily, what have we seen from some of the strategists on Wall Street? Have they said, believe in this little mini rally or it's just a head fake? What depends on who you ask? If you're asking Mike Wilson, the permabare of Morgan Stanley and Wall Street. Even he's on board saying that this might be actually a structural rally might be in the works. Will it be a sustainable rally is a different story? But he said the next couple of months because the gloom and doom is so baked into the market, and expectations have come down so much and have sold off so much. Maybe there is a turnaround story that we're poised for. But then if you ask some of the permaboles, they'll say, well, look at history. All of the major bear markets have bottomed in October, 1962, 1987. Perhaps especially in a midterm year, this is the beginning of a wider turnaround story. I guess it depends on how much gloom and doom you want to believe. There's something in it for everyone. David Darkboard. A short time. I feel like it's great to feel like whatever minute our day, we get a variety of opinions. But there is a consensus here, even between the bulls and the bears, that there is at least a temporary, a short term turnaround. All right. Well, good to know. All right, guys, great setup for us on this Tuesday. Pretty good. Thank you so much. Anchor and Markets course. I'm going to add Bloomberg here in our studio in Gina Martin Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence on the phone from New Jersey. I keep quoting how she talks. Those earnings estimates have come down so much from June. Yes. And maybe that's just kind of one of the last shoes to drop here. Is he think about, you know, what could set up a bottom for this market? All right. Right now back to you, world and national news for you for that. Let's turn to Denise Pellegrini. Hi, Denise.

If the GOP dominates in the coming midterms, Ukraine's efforts to repel Russia could be heard according to Democrats. Virginia Senator Mark Warner. I do fear that there is this Trump-led America alone contingent that could have greatly increased power in the House. And a Republican House next year could undermine that support. And Warner with us there unbalanced power with David Weston. Meantime House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy promising Republicans will pull back on aid to Ukraine if they gain control of the House. And McCarthy tells Punch-Bull News people will be sitting in a recession and not in the mood to write blank checks to Ukraine. A tight Senate race shaping up in Pennsylvania that focused turning to Democrat John Federmen's health, more from Bloomberg's Nathan Hager. Republican Mehmet Oz has cut Federmen's lead in the polls in half since August. Federmen had built that edge since May, even though he'd been off the campaign trail, recovering from a stroke. The two candidates meet for a debate one week from tonight. Democrats say they think voters are more focused on policy, but they admit an uneven debate performance from Federmen could be an issue for him. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. All right, thank you, Nathan. And President Biden today promising that if Democrats control enough seats in Congress next year, the first bill he will send to Capitol Hill will protect abortion rights and codify Roe v. Wade.

I'm Carl Master, along with Paul Swiney of Bloomberg Surveillance and Bloomberg Markets here in our interactive broker's studio. Couple of stores that I feel like they go together in terms of office demand. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, Wall Street, we keep hearing about as we navigate these difficult markets in 2022 that what's the one of the first things that Wall Street does or cut costs, they start cutting people. And we see a couple of stories, but I don't know. Some of the big banks that have reported over the last couple days are talking about their head count has, in fact, increased. Which is interesting, right? It's interesting. I'm not sure if they're working in the office or where they're working, but the head count's been increasing. And I think what we've heard from a lot of these big financial institutions is for every trader they hire, it seems like they hire two or three computer programmers. You know, I mean, it's all the technology investment they're making is head count. And so, you know, they're competing against the Microsoft, so the world, the IBMs of the world. So, interesting how they're still kind of growing their business. Well, Matt Boyle of our Bloomberg News team who covers kind of the work environment here at Bloomberg has a story at the talks about offices in New York specifically in other big US cities. Last week filled to their highest level since the pandemic hit, but occupancy still hasn't surpassed 50% in most places. Yeah. And I just don't know where that number ends up. It doesn't feel like it's going to be materially higher in the next year or two. I don't know. I can just tell by the train traffic, I'm on the New Jersey Transit every day. Right. Monday and Friday is kind of by myself with the conductor and then Tuesday on St. Thursday. Pretty crowded. And there's still a lot of open space. We're going to talk later on with Mark Dix and he's the founder and CEO of IWG. And he's going to talk specifically about how he and his team have found that cost cutting efforts by a lot of CEOs could kind of fuel the flex work space. And I do think about that, you know, Paul, if we're going to get into a tougher economic environment, a recession, are we there already? Might we get there later on next year? You know, the CFO is looking to cut costs. They're saying, let's move to flex work space. There's a story out on the Bloomberg today about GE closing down its suburban New York city campus up in Westchester. It's a huge campus where they bring people together. Like legendary, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Croughtonville, Croughtonville, I believe it's gone. So interesting. They're shooting that down permanently. It's very different.

Recapping stocks higher S&P up 1.3%. I'm Charlie Palette, that is a Bloomberg business flight. Come on, Charlie, I want to get to I think what is my favorite story today? We've got to stay tuned for that, so please share, which is? Listen up, everybody. And I am just going to put it out there. This is my favorite read of the day. I read it in this morning. It's also almost red on the Bloomberg. Paul, it's about how the Fed is giving us all a lesson when it comes to lag time. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the Fed is raising rates. They're raising rates aggressively. They've communicated that clearly, but it takes time. It doesn't work immediately. And Alison Shreger joins us. She is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. She's also a Bloomberg opinion columnist joining us on Zoom from the tri-state area. Alison, a lot of folks were expecting, okay, the Fed raises rates, economy slows. And I would argue it seems like other than maybe the housing market, this takes some time here, doesn't it? Yeah, it does. Because inflation, your expectations about inflation are in the future. You agree to a rental contract, you agree to a wage increase. This all happens a year in advance. So that's one of the reasons it takes a long time for Fed policy to work. What's important, and I have to just put out there, you are the author of a book with a great title and economists walks into a brothel, which my daughter swiped off my bookshelf who was studying economics, so she swiped it. You talk about the importance of expectations. We often talk about that in the financial markets overall, but when it comes to inflation, inflationary expectations, it's measured, we follow it. Why is that so important? Well, as I just said, when you agree to a wage contract, you agree to a rental department, whatever, this is based on what you think inflation's gonna be over the next year. So the monetary policy has shifted a lot in the last 30 years of thinking expectations or how you can influence people's expectations as what really matters and is the most powerful tool for monetary policy, so it's super important. Well, and just to follow, there's a difference between those expectations being well anchored and unanchored. What's the important distinction there? Well, they're well anchored, then people have a lot of, put a lot of credibility in the Fed. You know, this is one of the reasons why for a long time, the Fed was targeting 2% inflation. It was this idea as well, say it's 2%, everyone will believe it's gonna be 2%, and everyone's gonna conduct the economy, it's gonna be 2%, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But that all requires that people actually believe the Fed is actually gonna deliver 2% inflation, and it seems like they've become unanchored now. And Allison, you know, a lot of folks are saying this is not your grandmother grandfather's inflation. A lot of this was kind of due to the supply side issues resulting from the pandemic, and maybe there's a limit to what the Fed can do, and that's probably a valid argument out think. It is, I mean, this, unfortunately, this inflation has many fathers, so I mean, so I mean, this supply side issues definitely, you know, were part of it, but we also, and I mean, personally, we were following an old playbook in 2020 and 2021, which is to boost the economy, you've got to boost demand. So with the severe contraction supply, and then boost the demand on top of it, so all around, you just got a lot of inflation. And, you know, even if you do have supply induced inflation, you know, the remedy is often to reduce demand, because that's really sort of a lot easier to control. You know, the government can do things about supply, but I mean, it's even longer lags. If they said if Fed policy takes a year, maybe more, government sort of boosting supply can take, you know, other than sort of certain trade policies can take even like more time, like five, 10 years. So one of the things I also loved in your story, as you said, the bond market has a terrible track record predicting inflation. If history is any kind, bond traders are the last to know, when inflation is about to change, which I feel like, Alison, we spent a lot of time when we're talking with our TV colleagues about the financial markets. Oh, watch the bond market. It knows what it's doing. You're saying not necessarily the case. I've never understood why that's a thing. I mean, it said they have a terrible track record when we're talking about falcons.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4309,2022-10-18 18:26:26
15964," The financial market, oh, what's the bond market? It knows what it's doing. You're saying not necessarily the case. I've never understood why that's a thing. I mean, they have a terrible track record of predicting inflation. I don't even really believe inverted yield curves tell us that much. I mean, they're just bond traders are human, and they're just as fallables the rest of us, and they don't have special insight. And in fact, I think considering bonds are such long-term assets, they tend to be very short-term in their thinking. You know, Allison, this federal reserve has been really clear, I think, on its messaging here. I mean, starting with Jackson Hole, if you weren't paying attention that we want to fight inflation, now you're better. And they've been very consistent. Is that part of being a good federal reserve is clearly communicating to the market? Really, where do you want to go? It is. I mean, things following this intellectual tradition that this idea that communication and setting expectations is the most powerful tool. I think the problem the Fed has is it's a little late. Like, if they were more ahead of the curve on inflation, they might have had a bit more credibility. But the fact they kept insisting it was transitory. They keep putting out forecasts that suggest inflation is going to be back to like normal near. I think really undermines their message. So I think they're now doing the right thing, but it's a little late. All right. So in someone like Mark Moby, it says, hey, guys, get ready for maybe 9% moves and interest rates because that's what it's going to take to bring down the current inflation. How do you think about how high the Fed might need to go? And how much we need to kind of get our heads around it? I think 9% is a little high. I agree it would bring down inflation, but in that case, the cure might be worse than the disease. I think they're definitely going to go above 5%. The inflation number, I mean, the way I think about it is you want the real interest rate to at least be at inflation. So the Fed is still not trying to pump demand. But I would look at core inflation rather an overall inflation, which is inflation minus food and energy. So that's what about 6% to 9% around now. So I mean, it might go down just as more supply chain issues. So probably I think 9% is a little high, but we could be looking at 5, 5, and a half, maybe 6%. All right. Good stuff. Allison really appreciate it. Allison Schrager, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute. She's also a blue market pinion columnus joining us on Zoom, which we appreciate. We get this here. So that's she's zooming into us from the tri-state area. So good stuff here. It's inflation. It's a Federal Reserve. Does Federal Reserve? Yes. I feel listen to most experts was, was behind the curve, maybe still behind the curve. But it's not for lack of trying, at least over the last six to nine months. But we keep saying, OK, we're looking for signs for it to come down. But man, is it sticky in terms of coming down it. But she did emphasize, focus on the core, which is something we talk about a lot. Check out her book too. It's great title. It's a great book. And economists walks into a brothel and other unexpected places to understand risk. All right. You are listening and watching Blueburg Business Week on Blueburg Radio on YouTube.

This is Bloomberg Business Week. So thank God for trading. Yes, exactly. Especially fixed income trading. Right. Yes, every quarter seems to be different. The bankers lead the day, then some quarters. It's the capital markets. You know, it's yeah, but for gold when it was about the traders and the stock is rallying big time. We're going to get into their latest update and an outlook with our person on the job, Alison Williams of our Bloomberg intelligence team. First up though, let's get back to the markets and Charlie Palette. I thank very much. A lot of investors hoping to bank on further gains with the Dow, the S&P and Nezdaq all advancing right now. 50 point jump for the S&P up by 1.4% right now. Right to the numbers will give it a Y in a moment here with the Dow up 400 points now, up 1.3%. We've got Nezdaq up 125 points up 1.2%. The Nezdaq 100 index today now rallying by just about 1.1%. The 10 year 4.00% we have got the two year yielding 4.43%. Gold up a dollar at the ounce 16 51 little change there, West Texas, Intermediate Crew down 2.9% 83.02 a barrel bottom line here stocks are continuing their rebound from nearly oversold levels as traders assess prospects for earnings growth against a backdrop of rising interest rates. Among some of the companies out with earnings this morning, we did hear from Goldman Sachs now up by 2.7%. Also higher little change Johnson and Johnson up by 10 cents now up by less than 1.10% of 1%. So investors are digesting the latest batch of earnings reports, Netflix, United, JB Hunt, among the name scheduled to report after the close of trading. Kate Moore is head of thematic strategy at BlackRock Financial Management. Companies have a lot of levers to pull and use in order to engineer better earnings. And I would expect if revenue growth meaningfully weekends and the inflationary pressures across a whole variety of goods and services don't ease. Companies will do things like reduce headcount, slow down investment in different parts of their businesses that are not as profitable, all to protect the E. So you can have a weaker economic environment and actually a solid earnings environment. And right now we've got Netflix dropping by 8.1% this on a day when stocks are higher, UAL up 2.6% JB Hunt up by 1.4% Netflix UAL, JB, all reporting after the close of trading. Again recapping S&P up 48 up 1.3% Goldman now up 2.7%. I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flash. She's an incredible analyst. She's also a comic. She's running around doing the research and doing TV, doing radio because some bankers reported earnings this morning. Something called a little company in Goldman Sachs. Stocks up almost 3% in today's trade. Let's get to it with Bloomberg Intelligence, senior global banks analyst, Alison Williams. She's here in our interactive broker studio. All right. What do we need to know about Goldman? So number one trading still is the majority of their business and they delivered on trading. So fixed income trading up 41% that led across that and fixed income trading was the highlight of the investment bank this corner. Yeah. For all banks it was not interesting come but looking at the investment bank fixed income highlight fees the low light. So how about on the equity business because we got a S&P down big this year. NASDAQ down big can you make money trading equities and that kind of tape? I think the activity is helpful but we're up against a really strong quarter from a year ago. Prime brokerage is a business that benefits from higher asset prices use of leverage. So as you can imagine that's not doing as well. But I would say for Goldman the focus is you know what's happening on the market share front. They are one of the top three with Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan and that race has gotten a little tighter in recent quarters. I mean in a way that's all about bragging rights because they're all as the top three focused on profitability and doing well. But you know Goldman hold it held it down there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4312,2022-10-18 18:38:46
15967, In a way that's all about bragging rights because they're all as the top three I focused on profitability and doing well. But you know Goldman hold held its own there. And then to the fees everyone's fees are down dramatically. I mean broad declines across equity underwriting debt underwriting. So Paul the numbers 70 to 80% for year-old friends that are working away and trying to do deals and unfortunately not get a lot of. They had a few record ye are really good years. I mean last year was truly amazing. I think we were at a record you know in the middle of the year. Yeah. So this is when I'm just saying when it's these bad markets I talk about the pipeline. How's the pipeline at Goldman's? Look if I don't much to talk to my bosses about I say but I got a great pipeline. Right. And you would be saying that and you would be saying the same things since January the pipeline is strong and that's that is the positive things that we haven't seen that sort of take a step back. But the question is when did will that get executed? We have a few more days like we've had the past couple of days and we can get a little bit more rally. Does that open up a window to get some of these deals done? I think the program now. But there are things happening. There are and you know it was interesting if you looked at the debt side of things in August things opened up and it was a really strong month on that side of the business. You know there's a lot of questions around the leverage low marks right there was a big there were a lot of marks last quarter this quarter where the marks. And you know what we're also seeing the endowments is starting to report their performance and they're actually very I thought it would be down 20%. This is through June. They're kind of flatish and what that tells me is a they were pretty well hedge would be they that they haven't marked their big private equity investments today. I wonder if the banks are slow to mark investments because these things got to be done significant while there were big marks. I mean big marks in the context right so there were marks last quarter. I think this quarter was last because I think when the window opened up you know maybe there were some things that got done. And you know a couple of banks did give a number city gave a number I think it was something like 100 million last quarter is 126 million Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are going to be the ones we're watching because they're bigger in the leverage business Deutsche Bank has said they expect something we'll find out how big that is. But I mean for the industry. Jamie Diamond I think made made the great comments it's you know a fifth of what we were at the financial crisis so you remember back in those days that was a real concern what was going on. And just because the size of that business and the size of banks balance sheets today small business bigger balance sheets so is there is some Allison net takeaway as we try to kind of glean from what the CEO's had to say and how the big banks performed what it says about the outlook here. I would say there you know like the three takeaways one is the net interest income which was super strong that you know third quarter is history but the run rate is so much stronger coming into the fourth quarter that's good as we look into 2023 can the loans hold up can the class of deposits hold up. Secondly we talked a lot about trading we think that there continues to be volatility we think that helps fix income trading fees at least are steadying quarter to quarter so still down a lot year or year but we're starting to see some steadying so that votes well for next year. The last thing provisions that's what we call the wild card coming into this quarter right and they were a little bit higher than we expected but not by much so I would say tweaking the credit view. And maybe the biggest number that we got or the biggest statement for the quarter was Jamie Dimon saying you know if we go to 5 to 6% unemployment 5 to 6 billion provisions that's obviously worse than people expect but nowhere near what we saw. Okay good. Good stuff. Yeah Bloomberg intelligence senior global banks allos to Allison Williams thank you so much really appreciate it. Hey there Paul and another sign of positivity for the economy many of those banks who are just talking about well they are also increasing headcounts especially Goldman and Wells Fargo the only one that is cut headcount lately. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy says if the GOP takes back the House in November Republicans will cut back military support for Ukraine but Virginia.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4313,2022-10-18 18:42:57
15968," one that is cut headcount lately. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy says if the GOP takes back the House in November, Republicans will cut back military support for Ukraine, but Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner says that would be dangerous. He says Russia, meantime, getting drones from Iran, speaks to Moscow's military desperation. It's a telling comment that the Russians have used up so much of their munitions that they're actually turning to Iran and North Korea to buy additional armaments. In order with us there, unbalanced power with David Weston. Republicans also have some other things on there to do list if they dominate on Capitol Hill next year. Bloomberg's Emmy Mars has more than that. Republicans have vowed to investigate several Biden administration actions. Representative Michael McCall of Texas has zeroed in on the Afghanistan withdrawal. He wants the State Department to preserve any relevant documents that quote, maybe potentially responsive to a future congressional inquiry, request, investigation, or subpoena. In a report released in August, McCall called the withdrawal a strategic failure by the Biden administration. In Washington, I'm Amy Morris, Bloomberg Radio. Thank you, Amy.

I'm Denise Pellegrini. This is Bloomberg. All right. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Tuesday. Carol Maser along with Paul Swini. And you know, I was thinking it's been a while since we had a story about Twitter. Exactly. And brilliant. Yep. There you go. I mean, is this so is Elon Musk? I believe the date is October 28th, where the deal has to close if it's going to go through. And so and as you know, Carol, the Silicon Valley, it is a very, you know, kind of stock and options rich economy out there. That's how the people get paid out there. So Twitter, lock staff stock accounts in anticipation of deals. So I guess Twitter is getting ready saying we're going to shut down your accounts for that you can find cell stock and the options, which are very active. And it's a big source of just daily income, annual income for these people, but they're locking it down in anticipation of this deal closing. I love this that it happened on the employee FAQ page. So like if you randomly are going to the FAQ page, you found this out essentially. The alerted staff that they won't be able to access or trade shares from the equity awards center page that the change was done. So in anticipation of the closing of the pending acquisition of Twitter by an entity controlled by Elon Musk, according to two people familiar with this charge, our Kurt Wagner and Ed Ludlow reported. Yeah, great reporting as always out there. But you know, it's, I wasn't aware until I cut out the Silicon Valley years and years ago, you know, they kind of treat their stocks and their options and the liquidity associated with them, which is limited. But it's much better than it used to be as, you know, to pay the bills. Right. But tuition bill coming or a house payment, you know, I go to my firm and I sell some my options or some of the stock and it's just such a big part of their daily financials, financials, different here than this. So this is normal that we're hearing this? Yes, yes, I think so. But I think it would have been via some nice memo saying, hey guys, good news. We're about to close this deal. And if you own stock, you can get $54.20. But just to comply with certain regulations, you can't trade in your account until we close, you know. Interesting too. And if anybody was wondering, so Twitter seems to think? This is going to go through and certainly any legal expert you say or talk to you would say that this is contractually that Elon has to go through with it. Twitter shares a little bit higher on the news. You are listening and watching Bluebird Radio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4314,2022-10-18 18:47:27
15969," ziemlich From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Pellet. We're looking at a late-day fade here still green on the screen, but NASDAQ now up by 7 points up less than 1 tenth of 1 percent. The S&P holding onto a 17 point gain up by 5 tenths of 1 percent to now up 196. Up now by about 7 tenths of 1 percent key takeaway. Well off session highs. Traders are assessing prospects for earnings growth against a backdrop of rising interest rates. Speaking of earnings, as we were talking about, we heard from Goldman Sachs this morning Goldman up now by 2 percent. Also heard from Johnson and Johnson down by 1 tenth of 1 percent. Netflix, among the most closely watched coming up after the close of trading today, Netflix down now by 2.1 percent. Hasbro the maker of Transformers Toys and PEPPA Pig Entertainment reported earnings at Missed Estimates despite providing a business update just a couple of weeks ago as consumers, fertile, toy spending amid sky high inflation. detector's sum for now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4315,2022-10-18 18:52:43

I'm Charlie Palette, and that is a Bloomberg Business Fly. All right, got it, Charlie. Thank you so much. So we know earning season is getting a default swing, and next week we'll get an update on the business of meta-platforms. And ahead of that, in a story you can find online at BloombergBusysweek.com. How the founder of meta, of course we're talking about Mark Zuckerberg, isn't saying much about the core platform in business known as Facebook. Exactly, right. We're also going to get the truth behind the legs on the avatars in the metaverse. Let's get to this story. It's by columnist Max Chaffkin, who joins us along with the editor of Bloomberg Business Week editor, Jill Weber, both in our studio. But Max, let's kick it off with you. Tell us about what is really the focus. We know it's all about the metaverse for Mark Zuckerberg right now. Right. So meta, you know, AK Facebook is a very interesting company right now, because on one hand you have this enormous and very successful, you know, dominant business, which is social networking and advertising. So dominant that, you know, governments all around the world are, you know, worried about regulating it, even possibly breaking it up. We saw they had to defest from Giffy, a tiny company that acquired a couple of years back. And then you have the metaverse, which Zuckerberg is very excited about talking about all the time and is, you know, seems to be the, you know, much of his focus and the focus of the sort of senior executives around him. And there really just isn't a whole lot of traction despite tons and tons of spending, you know, and almost mind boggling sums of money that they're spending to try to make this thing happen. Is there traction within Facebook for the metaverse? Well, that is what's super detailed. You know, super discouraging from the point of view of a sort of meta investor. We saw reports over the last couple of weeks of meta employees not wanting to use their own product, which again, that's sort of discouraging on one level because you'd expect and hope that the people who are building this thing are excited about it. But also because Zuckerberg is pushing the idea that the metaverse is going to make a huge difference for office work, right? That it's not just a video game platform. And the reason he's doing that is because the video game business is actually pretty mature. You know, they've been at this for almost a decade. And the fact that they can't get their own employees to use the platform, how they say, we're all going to use it in the future, you know, doesn't, doesn't bode well. Hi, Max. So, I want to, I want to, I want to, you know, in Horizon World, is that what happened? Do we lose him? Well, I was there for a second, lost him a spreadsheet of my phone and as you write, soon going to be strapped to my face, that's spreadsheet. So I can see it much more closely. Ah, the metaverse comes into clarity. But I do think like there's an interesting kind of strategic decision here at meta of like this tack, maybe away from consumers and toward the corporate world and walk us through how that's looking so far. Right. So, if you watched Connect, which is their annual developer event for VR, a lot of the focus was around office work, as you said. You know, the big special guests, you know, they had some gaming announcements and they did sort of the usual stuff. But the big get was Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft talking about now, you can, you know, load Microsoft 365, which is the product most people know as office, word Excel, PowerPoint. You can do that in the metaverse. The chief executive of Ascensure showed up to say, you know, we, Ascensure, you know, think this is such a great thing, we've been, you know, doing brainstorming sessions on the end floor, which is the consultancies, you know, metaverse thing. And again, this stuff potentially could, could matter and you can sort of understand from a strategic perspective why Microsoft or why Ascensure thinks is a good idea, you know, Microsoft wants to be everywhere. But again, PowerPoints in the metaverse. Yeah. Yeah. So, hey, why not? On the other hand, it's really hard to watch that and think like, who is going to get excited about this? And talking about sort of the parts of office work that everyone hates, you know, spreadsheets, management consultants, you know, brainstorming sessions or whatever floor, where is that you really have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4316,2022-10-18 18:56:23
15971," parts of office work that everyone hates, spreadsheets, management consultants, brainstorming sessions, whatever. The floor, where is that again? You really have to be like sort of be in the management consultant to like this, which again, okay, maybe there are a lot of management consultants that could be a good business, but it just doesn't feel like they're generating a ton of excitement and when you compare that to the revenue, sorry, the amount of spending they've done, we're talking something like $27 billion since early 2019. They call that an investment, of course, Wall Street calls it a loss. So we'll see. Okay, so the headset is another thing that comes up in the story and has been, you know, talked about a lot, it's expensive, $1,500, right? Like what's your take on the headset? So the headset, it'll be very interesting, Apple is widely rumored, we've reported that they're working on a headset. It'll be interesting what they do. I think the headset was both sort of more expensive than a lot of people who watch Space Closely were hoping, you know, $1,500 is three times what Facebook's sort of consumer headset costs. It's kind of hard to imagine somebody upgrading. And then the technical capabilities, it includes eye tracking, which is, you know, very cool, I guess the company says for sort of meetings and things like that, but battery life is lower than their cheaper headset. You know, the processing power doesn't seem like hugely better. We even had a meta employee, you know, John Carmack, who's like an industry pioneer, sort of saying, you know, they're pros and cons of this device, which you wouldn't really want to hear when you're talking about your hot new product that you just released compared to something that you released, you know, two years ago that cost a third of the price. I'm wondering if nothing else this metaverse discussion has taken some of the attention away from some of the problems that Facebook has with the regulators. Elections coming up, things like this, it kind of feels like at least maybe unintentional head fake. So, or maybe it's an intentional head fake. I mean, you know, one of the interesting things that's happened is you go back two years ago, we were heading into a general election and all Mark Zuckerberg wanted to talk about was the platform sort of responsibility to society. We saw, you know, meta talking a lot about back then called Facebook, you know, talking a lot about election integrity, also talking a lot about public health and things like that. Now, what's happened since then is some of those duties have been sort of pushed off to other parts of the company. You know, we have Nick Clegg has been elevated to this sort of role that Zuckerberg, I think himself, was largely handling before. And as a result, you know, all the focus in terms of media attention and from a public policy point of view is on this new thing, which I think has come with some pros and cons. On one hand, Zuckerberg isn't taking it from all sides, like he's not maybe being criticized as much, even as there's tons and tons of misinformation on the platform today. On the other hand, a lot of focus on this platform that really doesn't seem to be thriving. And, you know, breaking up of those election teams that, you know, we're sort of a response to sort of some of the sketchy stuff that had happened previously and, you know, as you write, your kicker pretty memorable, got a paper for that metaverse somehow. Well, and you know, Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan's podcast a few months ago to talk about the metaverse. And that, you know, huge opportunity for the metaverse. But Rogan has been like a prominent, you know, vaccine skeptic. He's somebody who is kind of playing in this disinformation ecosystem. He's like exactly the guy that Mark Zuckerberg two years ago would have avoided. And now we see Zuckerberg kind of pivoting away from those concerns and to pumping this metaverse, you know, with questionable success. Well, it's an incredible read. And if you want to find the truth about the legs on the avatar, you're gonna have to read the story. On the terminal, or at bloomerg.com. Another great story from Max Chaffkin, calmness to Bloomberg Businessweek. And our thanks to editor Joe Weber, whether Joe Weber, editor at Bloomberg Businessweek, joining both in our studio, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Radio. the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4317,2022-10-18 19:00:38
15972,".... Come down to the clothes. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the US market clothes starts right now. This is countdown to the clothes just 60 minutes left in your trading session. Caroline Hyde, remain boss, Taylor Riggs, join our colleagues Carol Maser, Paul Swini, Tim Stenevich, we together welcome Filiya Cross our audiences of TV radio YouTube, a moment where Paul, who is in for Tim of course, and the perfect voice because it is Apple that kind of dictates trade for the last few minutes. We suddenly see a drawback in that particular king's stock and mainly a pullback in some of the benchmarks. But overall, Carol, we are still driving higher. Yeah, absolutely. Right, we just see a little bit of a fade but we're bouncing off those lows again. And watching for me, the airlines, we do have United reporting after the closing bell and they have in general been outperforming in today's trade. If I look at the S&P airline index, it's up almost 2% as we speak. That group by the way, up about 10 to 11% since a low in late September, United also rowing ahead of its earnings. That stock alone, Paul is up about 16% since that September 26 low. Yeah, absolutely. Another name coming after the close, highly anticipated will be Netflix. Stocks off about 1.5% today. But they'll off down at about 60%, 60% year to date. So there's a lot of concern here for Netflix in terms of their new subscriber ads and as well as their advertising supported tier that they're just about to launch. The moment it feels like the micro is kind of usurping the macro concerns right now. Let's dive in though to the macro benchmarks. We are up 6% to 1% 2% 2% that's called it on the S&P 500. And we're actually seeing volumes take higher a little bit on the day. We've got the Dow Jones up 7% to 10%. Langing is the NASDAQ. Now, up only 3% we thank Apple's pullback for that in large part. But still, volumes actually up about 20% versus your average. The Russell 2000. Still holding onto gains of 6% of percentage. And you wouldn't know it.iyorsun. F穆",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4318,2022-10-18 19:06:08
15973," then we thank apples pullback for that in large pot, but still volumes actually up about 20% versus your average. The Russell 2000 still holding onto gains of six cents a percent, Tina. And you wouldn't know it by looking underneath the surface, but it's actually a broad base to rally. Every sector is still in the green technology, though, is the laggard, and that what gives us sort of a hint of being less bullish than we were yesterday. And technology sector, of course, hunched to maybe one tenth of 1% higher on the day, but otherwise remains pretty risk-on. And if you're thinking about the cyclicals, industrials, materials, utilities, those are higher. But a lot of single-name volatility out there, you mentioned it at the top, of course, with Apple back and the red right now down, 3% up to a percent, was higher by more than 3% here on the day. All told, it's actually a swing from peak to trough for more than 4% here. So we'll keep an eye on that space. Similar story with Netflix, we get those earnings after the bell, the shares actually open by up by higher, by about 2% on the day. And then we're down as much as 3% here. And now down, right now 1.8% here. So again, a lot of volatility around two of the biggest names out there in the S&P and in the NASDAQ. Meanwhile, two interesting activists, are stories going on right now with Colgate, Paul Molliv, and Dan Loeb, and third point, taking a stake in that company and agitating for change. Including the potential sales that spin off of that pet's business, Colgate, Paul Molliv, shares up about a percent here on the Dan Salesforce. We were just checking in with Anna Rock, Rana over at Bloomberg Intelligence, talking about Starboard, and it's taking a stake in Salesforce. Anna Rock seems to think that this actually has a good idea, maybe a little bit more cost discipline over there for Salesforce, and it's leader, 4% gain here on the shares on the day. What about Dreamforce? Meanwhile, let's have a look at what's happening in terms of technical. What you call it, you said is there's one bit. The music first of it. The music first of it. Lenny Kravitz was there this year. Was he Lenny? Yeah, he doesn't come. That's where he is. He's bringing out Salesforce. Got that. All the celebs are. Let's have a look at what's happening in terms of your technicals, though, because actually maybe in large part, that's what's been dictating trade to this desire to be getting on these valuations and the technical levels. 200 week moving average is course what we broke through on Friday, and we pushed back above on Monday. We sustained it today. The 50% retracement level as well. We are north of that about 3500, Rick Carney, of course, at about 37. One of my favorite means was that when he was wearing that gigantic scarf, Lenny Kravitz was walking down and street, and then everyone kept editing the photo to a scarf bigger and bigger and bigger. Good times. You got something, Carol? Certainly do. I'm just waiting for you. It's finished up. All right, I'm going to go back to what Caroline was saying, because she talked to her. She talked to the S&P and support levels. And they've definitely been helped out by the Big Banks, which are up about 7% since Shapy Morgan first reported last Thursday. Goldman reported today, so that stock move higher. We love the commentary that we get from the Big Banks CEOs, and that includes a Chaneli Bossa who caught up with the CEO of Goldman Sachs. We're talking about David Solomon post earnings. And here's what he had to say when you tighten economic condition so quickly, and we are really tightening the very, very quickly, you're going to have, you know, disruption and economic activity. But he point to so many different concerns, guys, throughout that conversation here with Chaneli. He talked about rising rates globally, equity markets, well off their highs, geopolitical instability, GDP growth expectations are declining. I mean, Paul, that worry list is pretty long. It is. It is. You know, one of the industries I really like, I think it's a very interesting industry, but I've never been on a cruise, but I love the cruise industry. The carnivals up about 11% today. They're able to get a bond deal done today. The bad news is they had to pay 11% coupon. Well, much higher than what we've seen from like issues. But the good news is they were able to up size that deal from $1.25 billion. Well, that actually seemed like a good deal given that everyone thought they should probably be paying a lot more than that. Yeah, the price talk came in a little bit better. The demand came in a little bit better. And the stock is up 11%. It's the number one gainer in the S&P 500 today, even if you take a look at that balance sheet and all that debt, pretty impressive. It was interesting to go into some of those segments, Paul. We were talking to Olivia Ramundi about how the average yield right now on the high yield index on a yield to worse basis is about 9.6%, 10%. So 11% doesn't seem that bad. I think when we think about this stability that we're getting, is this an idiosyncratic story about investors just sort of are gravitated to this name? Or is this a little bit of a signal of a little bit of a reopening of those credit markets, a little bit more of a willingness and investors to take on some of that risk? That narrative seems to prevail when you're looking at day two of what has been a decent rally here. HYG, the ETF that tracks high yield, currently up for a second straight day. It was at 1.25% yesterday. So I guess I'm in another 5.10%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4319,2022-10-18 19:09:56
15974," Day two of what has been a decent rally here. Oh, H-Y-G, the ETF that tracks high yield, currently up for a second straight day. It was at one, and a quarter percent yesterday. It's had another 5-10 percent. So maybe just both, once again, a signal of a little bit of the moon music changing of people wanting to put a little bit more cash to work at these levels, not calling a bottom, the Bank of America survey saying, look, it's really going to be into mid-2023 when really the true capitulation moment comes from the Federal Reserve. But maybe just willing to put some money to work at these levels. And that kind of has a circle as back to earnings here. And the idea that the companies aren't basically talking about us going off in the cliff. I mean, we mentioned the David Solomon quotes. And of course, we heard Brian Moynihan, a Bank of America, as well as Jamie Dimon. And now, I guess tonight, maybe we'll get some commentary out of Netflix poll. I know they don't have a traditional conference call and that people actually ask them questions and they respond. It's just one person. But it'll be interesting to see what they have to say about just the man going forward. Yeah, absolutely. And of course, next week we get a lot of the big tech names coming out next week. And that's always a big market moving event here to get a sense of where capital spending is for the global economy as it relates to tech technology. So we'll find the winners and losers next week. Yeah. And it'll be interesting to see if even, you know, a little bit of a beat, a little bit of an app performance to that lowered bar, whether or not investors react positively or whether they're looking for a lot more in those releases. Meanwhile, the meme from Lenny Kravitz was bought about in the year 2012, from May and June. That long ago, wow. I'd say go online and Google Lenny Kravitz. And it's the fourth thing that comes up is Lenny Kravitz scarf. I mean, it was a nice scarf. It was just a little large. That's all. He was called a party, Romania's cold. And he still owns it. He still owns it. So OK, can we get interview with him? Everybody's going to be Googling that meme right now. We know that's what's going to happen. All right, guys, we're going to be. It's a scarf indicator. That's capitulation. It could happen. It could happen. It's a scarf out again. All right, we're going to be back in less than an hour's time. Our cross-platform coverage, radio TV, YouTube. We're going to count you down to the close beyond the bell. We're going to count you down to the close on this Tuesday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business. We're going to get back to our TV colleagues and count you down in less than an hour's time in the meantime. I mean, that coronal issue, it's a big deal. It is. I mean, it's interesting. Coronable issue to a lot of debt here today. They have a very tough balance sheet in an operating environment. But they're able to up-size the deal. That's a good side. And the coupon actually came a little bit lower than the price talk. The price talk this morning was about 11.5%. They were able to get it done 11%. So maybe just a little bit of an opening for some of this new issuance here in the credit markets we'll see. But they've got to earn their way through out of this balance sheet over the next couple of years. I do think it's interesting, though, what it says more broadly about the market that their investor is willing to take it on. You do wonder if there was financial stress or tightening within the financial market. They're very loyal people. They love the crews. They're like, pandemic, what pandemic? Let's go. Have you talked to Charlie Pellet? Yes. Oh, yes. I did a whole thing on Carnival a few years ago. And I remember being on the ship and being an elevator and talking to people and they're like, oh, this is my fourth crew. Cruiser, this is my fifth crew. So I'm already thinking about coming back. So you're absolutely right. They are incredibly loyal. And they are investing in their ships and they're ready for growth as an industry. Yep. And they had been getting me to some of the older ships that they've got, just like the airlines, right? They get rid of kind of the less efficient, you know. Are you planning to do any crews? No. I only did it because I went on a cruise because I was doing a report. So I did it kind of double night overnight to kind of do some reporting and filming. All right. I'm thinking about it. I would like the smaller cruises. I'm a smaller boat person. Maybe a river cruise in Europe. Yeah. A little Viking. I think they own Viking. Yeah. Oh, that's right. They own a lot of brands. All right, let's get back to World of National News. For that, it's back to Denise Pellet Greenie. She's in our Bloomberg Newsroom. Hey, Denise. Hey, Carol.

15976," All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well, our next guest is entrepreneur, maybe even a serial entrepreneur. Among the companies he's founded, Thumbplay, a mobile entertainment service, it grew to more than 100 million in revenue, unless in three years before he exited the company, which was later acquired by Clear Channel and is now called I Heart Radio. We've got a great crust with us. Are you trust all? Yeah, founder and CEO of the data sharing platform, Chris, they have an interesting mission of helping companies make their supply chains more efficient, reduced waste and boost profits. So he is here in our interactive Bloomberg Studio. So I read about your company, Paul read about your company, tell us exactly what you are doing and who you're working with. Great. Yeah, so you work with a lot of large retailers, a lot distributors and a lot of large brands. So with the pandemics, brands that we know, publicly low company, large brands, three, four, three, four hundred large brands on the platform. And they saw during the pandemic and the supply chain challenges that they needed just to collaborate better with the retailers and understand the data better so that they don't run out of products. We all see empty shelves and we've seen challenges with under supply and overstock and all of that. And everybody realized during the pandemic and the supply chain challenges that actually need to collaborate around data to not create waste and also be also put products on the shelves. Well, and so you know, so let's see. It's interesting that you said it. So you saw in terms of the demand for your services ramp up in a big way during the pandemic or post pandemic. Oh, yeah, yeah, before nobody cared with fortune to sell a company here in New York and then traveled around the world and then saw all these challenges with supply chain, especially in the food side, but a third of all the food that's made in the world actually never reaches a consumer one third. And then another one third is lost when the consumer gets it. So over 50% of the food has no no human. It reaches no human. So no, it's pretty remarkable, right? In a world where people are starving that there's so much food waste exactly over a billion people. So that was inspiration behind it. And but before the pandemic, nobody really cared and during the pandemic, everybody cared about it. So are yeah, and does it stay with us? Are like the stress that we've seen on supply chains and companies having to make them much more efficient, much more productive, much more sustainable? Is that something real or is sustainability aspect of it just kind of a cool thing to do or something changed? It definitely changed during the pandemic. And we see all of these challenges in the supply chain before it was easier to manage in a way, but now you see inflation increases, you see strikes, you see labor costs, you see shortage of labor, you see better, you see seasons, there's a lot of things that is hitting the supply chain. And it might be a hundred million companies actually collaborating in a way to get products to the consumers. But were they were they collaborating before? What's different? Because the collaboration was there. We talk about the massive global supply chain. That's been in existence for decades to be there. So what's different? You know, the whole supply chain runs on technology that was created the year I was born in 1973. It's called EDI. And that's just purchase orders that get sent through. It's very reactive. And the ones that are further, for the upstream, they actually don't understand what the consumers are doing. So they get all of these disorted demand signals to have the supply chain. So they end up producing a thousand when the actual consumer demand is a hundred. And then you get what we're seeing now where all this is coming in in the reverse in a way. So now we have overstock and over supply and 21% more inventory is actually sitting in the retail chains now because because of this night you said they had 65% more inventory than they had a year ago. So now it's kind of coming in in reverse again from the shortages that we had seen earlier. Well, so how much of that though was companies are in many ways ordering ahead to make sure they weren't cut, you know, found out to be short. You know, exactly what's happened. They typically say you run a retailer on the upper upper east side. You're ordering a hundred products. If I'm the wholesaler and I give you 50 products, the retailers smart up and now we order 200. So they could get a hundred. If I'm sending that as a retailer or my wholesaler back to a brand again, now they believe that this consumer demand has actually increased and the brand might have six months to actually produce this product. So I might make 800 now, but actually consumer demand didn't change that much.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4322,2022-10-18 19:25:35
15977," to actually produce this project. So I might make 800 now, but actual consumer demand didn't change that much. So based on you, obviously can't tell us exactly who you're working with and all the companies, a little bit of maybe Garner some stuff from looking at the website. But what you are seeing, this supply chain story that has been with us for several years now because of the pandemic, what does it tell you about supply chains kind of getting back to quote unquote, normal? And what does it tell you about the global economy? You know, I think it's going to stay with us for a long time. I think it's going to take a long time before actually all of this gets worked out throughout the supply chain because there's always these new disruptions that are hitting the supply chain. So I think it's going to stay with us for a long time. So in other words, it's going to be shortages. And we just go into the same things. We have too much. And then people will stop. Why is it such a mess now? You know, there's this theory called blue whip theory that says that it ripples through the whole supply chain. And it gets the sorted through the supply chain because information is not real time. So if you're sitting three or four steps away from the actual retailer, it's very hard to understand if the consumer demand actually went to 5% or did it actually go over 800%. So that's a systematic problem that will stay with us for a long time. Just got 20 seconds. Be quick if you could. Are you also seeing that the supply chains are going to be a little crazy and all over the place because people are putting the supply chain. It's a big part of this as well. So there's always disruptions that happen. And you need data. That's the thing. All right, we got to run. Ari, thank you so much. Ari Charles-Dolf, founder and CEO at Crisp.

Netflix reports after the close of trading investors will be looking to see if the company makes good on its forecast for a return to subscriber growth after losing customers in the first half of the year. Geitha Ragnathan follows media stocks for Bloomberg intelligence. So I think sentiment obviously was that it's weakest earlier this year that we've seen a little bit of a change now in that sentiment. Things are getting a little bit positive and that's really because Netflix is now the narrative has kind of shifted away from slow growth or no subscriber growth to a business model that is going to be supported by advertising and that's where there probably will be a lot of upside. And again we do have Netflix downside now down 1.5% also reporting after the close of trading UAL United Airlines holdings up 2.7% and JB Hunt JB Transport Services that is the trucking company of 5.1.3% recapping S&P of 1.1% I'm Charlie Pout of that is a Bloomberg business flash. Alright Charlie good stuff we appreciate that as always you know we love talking about electric vehicles here Matt Miller really likes talking about electric vehicles I think pretty much everybody likes talking about it because it's such a cool new technology. Have you bought one yet? No but I did test drive the Ford F150 Lightning Matt arranged that for me so I had it for four days it was awesome awesome just couldn't believe the technology of the electric vehicle but somebody hire up a Bloomberg's really smart person somewhere said hey let's do a weekly radio spot and we'll call a Bloomberg plugged in our weekly look at the electric vehicles at Lelo joins us here West Coast car spotter for Bloomberg News somehow he's been hanging around New York for weeks I don't know what's going on but he joins us here in our Bloomberg interactive work or studio I think you don't have a home anymore now. It's just he says something nomad you know so any who is. Let's talk about let's talk about Foxconn sure you got this crazy story on the Bloomberg terminal this is the company that makes iPhones but you're not telling me they're going to make electric vehicles they are and their theory or their thesis is simple we know supply chains we can build electronics on behalf of other companies we can do it for electric vehicles and what was fascinating on Tuesday they involve two prototypes an SUV and a pickup truck and this is just two years after they first kind of announced they were going to move into EVs they're not on name at all these are just reference points it's them saying look at what we can do if you're a big name out there in the world of automotive let us do this for you fascinating. So basically hey we can design our cars we can do all the engineering the development but Foxconn go ahead and manufacture. Yeah so I'll give you an example you long group is a Taiwanese automaker and they Foxconn build a vehicle on their behalf it just manufactures it assembles it and then sells it under that name plate one of the questions put to Foxconn in the press conference around these prototypes was when do you expect to build more vehicles than Tesla the response we hope to build vehicles for Tesla you know and it's a really interesting way of looking at it because you know think about Tesla the market incumbent how long it took them to get to this point you know where they're just such a clear leader think about the struggle that Ford and GM are going through to transition from combustion engine to electric what Foxconn is saying is hey we can make this happen a lot more quicker from prototype concept to mass production because of how we already operate within global supply chains. So is there aspiration to get manufacturing orders production orders from a Ford from a Volkswagen? I think so so one of the models they unveiled on Tuesday was the Model V a pickup truck and they said that this pickup truck will be produced in Taiwan, Thailand and the United States but remember there's no ambition here to sell a Foxconn or Huan Hai position that the publicly traded on car. Well they know the US market when they're talking pickup truck. Right so the idea is here that they try and find a willing buyer somebody that's trying to get to market with a pickup and build it on their behalf. Geopolitical concerns I mean with the difference between the US and China you tell me how Ford is going to say to a Chinese factory or GM.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4325,2022-10-18 19:38:55
15980," somebody that's trying to get to market with a pick up and build it on their behalf. Geopolitical concerns. I mean, with the potential between the US and China, you tell me how Ford is going to say to a Chinese factory or GM, go ahead, take it run with it. Right. Well, one of the advantages that Foxconn has is sort of global manufacturing footprint. I mean Apple does it already. So yeah, exactly. But there is definitely a concern here that what if they're not able to take that manufacturing base outside and supply chain base outside of mainland China, think about what Foxconn's already doing here, bought the former GM plant in Ohio that lords town a start up with struggling to get off the ground. Foxconn came and said, we'll take this from you and we'll do it on your behalf. Well, I also think about the legislation that was just passed with the EV vehicles, but it had to be vehicles, right, that are made here in the United States. And there's a move, I think, is it France looking to do maybe the same thing? Yeah, we'll give you a credit, but it has to be made in Europe or something. I think part of it is that China's electric vehicle industry is much more mature. There are many more players that supply chains mature, but think about the hold they have over the commodities market as well as some of the IP competition is going on around chips. So it's definitely an area that people are just laying, but Foxconn certainly has ambitions to build within the United States. They're just saying, here's some cool things we've done. They're flexing. This is what we can do. How about we do it on your behalf? It just made clear to me and I just kind of today, because I was talking about Miller about this, how do you differentiate between different EVs? Like it's not like that. Right. It's a different engine type. There's a turbocharged blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Here, it's just a shell and an electric motor. I guess the question Matt was telling me how much battery power you want, which would be a good engine. Well, it's also a trade off cost price versus what the EV can do. Testlers are amazing. They certainly have advantage in software, not just on self-driving, but when it comes to battery management. But Foxconn is saying, well, let's look at the other end of the scale and price. How do we bring in affordable EV to our market with a more modest range? Let's be honest, Tesla has kind of given up on that objective. The idea of them working toward $25,000 EV has gone out the window. But that's certainly what fought part of what Foxconn is offering here. We can do it for you at scale and cheap. It's also somebody could help ramp up EV production. It sounds like very, very quickly as like a story. Right? And that demand seems to be increasing globally in a big way. And the low, thank you so much. Don't go back home. We just have your home on East Coast. Bloomberg news, West Coast course by Ed low, Ed low here in our Bloomberg Business Week studio. All right.

A fifth person has died in this week's Russian comic coset drone attack on a residential building in Kiev. Neighbors calling it part of a wave of Russian hits by Iran made drones on civilian targets in Kiev. I don't know why because it's not military within only civil people, only civil keys on the city people. Why for work? And meantime, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy says Republicans will move to cut aid to Ukraine. If they dominate Congress after the November elections, Democratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner, though, pushing back on that. I do fear that there is this Trump led America alone contingent that could have greatly increased power in the House and a Republican House next year could undermine that support. And Warner, they're on Bloomberg balance power. And the Biden administration announcing $15 million in new grants to treat mental health and addiction authorized under the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.

I know Charlie's been talking about it, Paul, but man, what is swing about a 4.5% swing? And right now the stock was a little bit of a dip on news of after the information reported that the tech giant cutting production of its iPhone 14 plus citing people familiar with the matter, but the stocks off its lows. Yeah, it's interesting. The information is reporting that they're actually cutting production. Bloomberg, late last month, reported that Apple was backing off plans to boost production of the iPhone. So this takes it a step further. Not only is Apple reportedly not going to boost production in a second half of the year, which was originally thought, but the information is not reporting that they will actually cut production. So that kind of goes to that obviously the demand picture for this iPhone 14, which I don't know. I've told me he's waiting a year for the next one. The next one was supposed to be a bigger, bigger upgrade. And so this one, he was not going to go by. Every time a new phone comes out, like Mark Herman, is it time for me to upgrade? Because I'm always like an ill-begined ads incremental or like that. And so I may wait another year. Yeah, so it's interesting, but they had some new products this year redesigned entry-level iPad. That's the first one in five years. So long time. Yeah, a new space, particularly in tech world. It seems like we were getting them every year. Also, Mark Herman is reporting that a new speedier pro model and a cheaper TV set top box, seeking to entice consumers as it heads into what's expected to be another record holiday quarter. So gadgets, gadgets always sell. I agree with you. And I feel like whenever Apple reports, even if there's some disappointment, it always is these massive numbers and billions and billions of dollars in sales. And I find it also increasingly interesting how they're making their own chips, using their own chips. I mean, they are just all in on every aspect of it. By the way, Apple reporting October 27th, excuse me, after the closing bell. So we'll look for those numbers. The numbers I like for Apple are 180 billion in cash sitting on the balance sheet and 107 billion dollars of free cash flow. I mean, for a year, free cash flow, it's just extraordinary. So those are the numbers that kind of jump out of the Apple. So some new products driving the top line for Apple. A lot more.

This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board. Russia's efforts to use natural gas exports as a geopolitical weapon present Europe with a challenge. When faced with such a threat, can it muster the solidarity required of a true union? After all, Vladimir Putin's energy cutoff is a classic external shock that will hurt some European countries more than others. No doubt, efforts to expand risk-sharing will face strong political headwinds. But at the very least, the EU should be able to establish a permanent fund to provide loans and grants in emergencies. Ultimately, what's needed is a central fiscal authority with its own revenue source and the power to spend when needed to mitigate asymmetric shocks. If a hybrid war with Russia can't bring the EU to even consider such a possibility, it's hard to imagine what will.

Oh, no, no, no, no. Who's going to drive you home? Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive-o. Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question that drives us. This is the drive to the close. That punk to me is a thing called driver, the other dog on Bloomberg radio. All right, this is a very interesting situation. Continental resources, share billionaire, Harold Ham's latest offer to take continental resources. Private is still too low. That's according to Smead Cabal to management. The oil explorer is largest minority investor. Ham on Monday boosted his all cash offer to $74.28 per share, but Smead believes that they should be paying about $90 per share. Let's check in with Colesmead, president and portfolio manager of Smead, capital management joining us on the phone from London. Coles, give us what you think is going on with the company, with their board, with management vis-a-vis their offer. Yeah, that's a great question and thanks for having me on. So you have to remember that first off, Harold Ham is nothing short of a genius in the space. He's built himself an incredible net worth and in many cases has deserved that out of his hard work and understanding the business and being way more aggressive than anyone else. Those were all the reasons that we were interested in the business. With the offer he threw in, he's a great card player. It's the kind of person you don't want to be across the table from when you're not on his side. He threw in an offer that we assume that he hoped oil prices would back off on. Obviously, not enough because he had to raise the price which we knew was going to be likely. The difference though is he raised the price just to please the special committee. It doesn't mean minorities agree with this. It doesn't mean that this is the true value of the business. When we say 90, that's what we kind of expect in a fair deal versus what do we think the business is worth? We think it's worth over $100 just so you're aware. I'm looking at the shareholder list here on the Bloomberg terminal. HDS is the symbol when you load in the ticker. I got Harold Ham, 43% of the outstanding and then lots of other various trust and family members here. They control this thing. What's the recourse for minority shareholders here? It's a good question. When this deal was originally announced in June, we had reached out to the special committee's council to make sure we get the chance to engage with them as well as speak with their financial advisor which was publicly disclosed finally that's ever core. Now that was communicated to us by their council just so you're aware that never took place. We never got the talk to either the special committee or the financial advisor. When we saw this announced, it was contrary to what we had communicated to us as the largest minority. We provided five things that we were interested to find out where we felt that continental poorly disclosed. Why can they poorly disclose? Because to your point when Harold's your largest shareholder and his family controls the business, you don't have to disclose much because you're the shareholder. We're still interested. They'll have to provide a filing here in the next couple of weeks or so off of what they're going to be providing in the tender. We're interested to see the process that the board did or did do. We're interested to find out the five things we flagged to them. We're actually even considered because if they're not, you can kind of start to see a dialogue where they might have followed a process to not have a conflict. The questions do they do their job. So how far do you take this? Well, I mean it's Oklahoma Corporation so it doesn't follow Delaware Chanceree Court. What is particular to Oklahoma is their special appraisal rights under Oklahoma law where we could take them to court and prove a higher valuation ultimately. So we're interested to see what they're going to file in following this. But we have to see those documents first and we'll probably ask for further information if there's enough.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4329,2022-10-18 19:56:17
15984, that what they're going to file following this uh... but we have to see those documents first and and will probably ask for uh... further information if there's you know enough to disclose that we again for how poorly we've been treated in this process so far that will not at all be shocked if that filing has almost nothing in it because again this looks like it's a home or and you're playing away basketball game you ain't getting any calls uh... local the reps are on your side couple things here having been through these this process a few times the bankers have to do comparable valuations i have to justify the valuation has to trade in line with recent deals with recent public trading so you have to do all that type of stuff number one number two i look at the price chart this stocks never been north of eighty dollars a share ever so they could probably be saying you know why should i pay a hundred well accept that uh... they don't have to own the pioneer assets that they bought for a song less than you know roughly about twelve months ago uh... it was disclosed in the quarter that that deal close that that asset produced a hundred fifty million dollars of free cash that was a year ago with obviously lower oil prices uh... so what i don't think either the wall street analyst that covered the stock really understood i think ham get this we get this is that it is a hashtag on what he could do to lever this thing as a private business uh... you could borrow every nickel of the four billion dollars he needs so uh... you know again he's a great car player he's not going to give you anything close to fair uh... because it's about herald ham in this transaction it's not about anybody else and and that's where we disagree that's where it's just finally don't a lot how do you think this is going to play out here what's the most likely time frame i guess and is there a number you would come down to that's a little bit off your number but a little bit closer to his number uh... well uh... that's all part of the process i guess and uh... we're like it's that we're just interested to see what that process was for example if if someone said cool what what would you expect that we would have expected someone to come in an offer and he is filing in june he said he was not interested in anyone else's offer uh... now he's frustrated stock is not being valued like it should be he's right in that we agree with him in that uh... and all stock deal from devon energy would have been really interesting to us because they have a lot of crossover same geography uh... as continental resources and what ham could be is there large anchor shoveled is that that and doesn't have well both companies are doing it what and the way that i wouldn't do is they're paying too much of dividends they should be buying back stock ham couldn't do it because you'd be buying too many minorities out devon can't do it because they can't find any courage right now uh... but that would be our dream deal hey last thought and last questions i mean you have a bunch of energy names among your top holdings um... is there a big macro play here for you i mean we've certainly seen energy being the outperformer by a mile wide margin this year and just got about thirty seconds call yeah no energy looks like the easiest game in town in a ten-year-grade for stocks are going to do terrible uh... this looks like the seventies this looks like the two thousand uh... if you want my other big idea uh... in our international portfolio we own meg synovus buying meg looks pretty attractive we own synovus as well and we also on oxy so we love about the inaround we love having billionaires being interested in our ideas who doesn't uh... cost me fun to spend some time with you and really dig into uh... your holdings continental resources cost me present and portfolio manager at some capital management joining us on the phone from one of the way that's me value fund has been just about all of its peers over the past five years returning on average nearly twelve percent and i think something i mean values been great past couple couple and a half years before that yet right to see that uh... longer out uh... performance there or it folks time to head over to a tv colleagues it's time for beyond the bell and radio tv and youtube beyond the bell bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the u.s. market closed starage right now and right now we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day romaine buster carolina i'd tell a race countenia down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell it's our simulcast global simulcast carol master paul swiney and for two senate victim we welcome our audience is across bloomberg television radio as well as on youtube a close of the market to now the setup carol right now for netflix earnings gonna cross the wire any minute now i'm kind of glued to our live blog just waiting for those now,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4330,2022-10-18 20:00:44
15985," for Netflix earnings going across the wire any minute. Yeah, I'm kind of glued to our live blog just waiting for those numbers to cross. In the meantime, we've had a green day, but it's been a volatile one. And Paul, we've definitely been bouncing around here on the equity side of things. Yeah, we're going to end up in green, but we had some really strong gains here this morning. Lost a little bit of the momentum, but founded again. But as Remain was mentioning, the street will be really focusing on Netflix. How many subscribers did they add? And tell us about this ad-supported tier? Paul, we love having you one day's like today. Parachuting UN because of course this is your huge expertise. And we get to leverage your knowledge from the cell side as well when we think about the fundamentals. And really of course, Caroline, the way that this presents sort of the macro picture of another big bellweather. And now of course, going to be a player in the ad space. And the microse starting to perhaps overtake some of the macro headwinds that we've so fixated on. But really, is this a question of fundamentals? Have we actually been more technically driven in terms of the bounce that we see across the benchmarks today? Yeah, I mean, interesting to see what people are buying, whether it really is just about valuation or sort of that proverbial capitulation. We saw in that note out by Bank of America from that latest fund manager survey. Capitulation, when it comes to investors, capitulation, when it comes to the macro. And if you believe Michael Hartnett, capitulation when it comes to policy. Don't think we're quite there yet. Nevertheless, here are the closing bell numbers here. Dow Jones industrial average going to finish today higher by about 1.2% the S&P higher by 1.2% the Nasdaq higher by 9.10% and the Russell 2000 Carol going to finish the day higher by about 1%. Yeah, still pretty broad based in terms of the moves to the upside. 451 names in the S&P 500 gaining ground today, Taylor 51 lower one unchanged. And go ahead. No, go ahead, Romaine. Now just keeping an eye here on Netflix earnings should be crossing the wire any second now. Yeah, we're getting some releases out here on the investor wire. We'll wait to get those of course as we think about that. In the meantime, we get a lot of stability within the bond market. Here come the numbers. We see Netflix not providing paid membership, Taylor, forecast starting in fourth quarter. So overall, we are seeing that they were fourth quarter revenue of 7.78 billion. That is a miss versus to the estimate of 7.98 billion. Third quarter streaming paid net change, up to a million, a big beat. And of course, winning back all that they lost in the first half of the year. Here's your revenue number coming in for Q3, 7.48 billion dollars. The year over year growth, that's about 16%. Not bad here, operating income 1.8 and we should point out the operating margin right now with 23 and a half percent here. The EPS number coming in at $3.19. We're going to get you some comparisons here, but two things jump out at me Taylor Riggs. The first is free cash flow, negative 106. Or right now, we're looking at free cash flow and net cash provided by operating activities is positive, but only at 82 here. So an interesting mixed picture here for Netflix as a pivot now to what I guess is supposed to be a new ad here and potentially a re-acceleration in growth. And one of the big questions from Lightshed Partgers, Rich Greenfield of course, is are you shifting your content strategy to reduce costs when you think a look at the negative free cash flow number? What that means? We're getting through page 2 here of the press release, Carol. And they talk a lot about of course, again, US dollar strength is a significant headwind for them of what they call them and you're really looking at a sequential decline in the fourth quarter and their forecast entirely due to the strength of that dollar. And again, you wonder how that sort of is impacting the way they're able to forecast those numbers too. Gotta say for radio TV, you can see it clearly, but the stock is up more than 8% in the after hours. And I'm looking at our live blog, Chris Paul Mary Entertainment Reporter follows Netflix very closely. Revenue, earnings, subscriber gains are all a beat, Paul. Yeah, the subscriber gains for this quarter came into $2.4 million. The consensus was for, I'm sorry, 1 million subscribers that came into 2.4. So better on subscriber number, we're not going to get any subscriber guidance starting next quarter. And that's the company saying we really want Wall Street to pivot away from the subscriber story and start looking at the revenue and the cash flow and the earnings. But if that is the case, Paul, what is that story? 7.78 billion, that's the forecast. That's not really in line with estimates, in fact, it's a touch of light. But more importantly here, at least on a quarter to quarter basis, doesn't actually represent a tremendous amount of growth. No, it doesn't, but I think it's really going to be about the profitability here. We know that the US market, which is the most mature market, is very profitable. And it's more and more of their international markets mature. It's going to be a real profit story, assuming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4331,2022-10-18 20:05:12
15986, know that the u.s. market which is their most mature market is very profitable and is more and more of their international markets mature it's gonna be a real profit story assuming they can in fact keep a lid on those programming expenses all i'm curious what you say top three of the press release they say that our aim is to give perspective new members more choice not to switch current members from their current plans this is of course when they're talking about that ad subscription model what do you make of cannibalization and their words the lack of it uh... it is a risk because i know what my subscriber revenue is i'm not sure what my revenue models going to look like i can model that out but i'm just not sure what my cost for it would i'm be able to charge for an ad on netflix uh... they're gonna only air about four minutes an hour of uh... ads versus maybe fifteen minutes an hour in a network show so it is a unknown model to them and it's an unknown model to wall street uh... so it's gonna be a little bit of a uh... i guess here over the next really couple years i would say they developed this advertising business what's interesting is of course what the first company to really be blaming dollar strength on a lot they say it's january will hurt the year revenue by about a billion dollars the dollar strength and really saying that's the sequential decline in revenue for this quarter just gone entirely due to effects overall remain i think it's in the in just to get away from the numbers here i think it's interesting they actually some interesting commentary here about how they release on new titles here and they talk about sort of the bingeable release model and basically defending it saying that according to them this is their words it helps drive sustained substantial engagement especially for newer titles it also talks about how it wants a better a metrics with regards to how they measure of of viewership sort of similar to those new listen ratings basically saying that you use something i guess it's familiar to you in the u-k.k.a.r.a line the broadcasters audience research board and send it they want to see a better accounting for how streaming services uh... viewership on some of these streaming platforms interesting and maybe this gets to polls point to that this isn't now just about subscribers they really want to show the impact of what they're putting out there and maybe that is the story they say squid games would not have become a global momentum if we hadn't binge it and released it all at once that's how they're thinking of building that momentum uh... let's get out of the program into this conversation she's the media analyst for us at down at bloomberg intelligence keep the uh... just tell us what jumped out of the most out of this report i mean few other relief here what seeing these numbers i mean they're for finally back to growth which is really good uh... and their guidance right now again pretty much in line and what's really encouraging to me about that for q guidance is that they say that they've really not baked in any of those ad tier expectations so there is potentially a lot of upside to that guidance as well remember for q is one of their heaviest quarters they have a huge huge line up of uh... big hitting content titles uh... so again there there's a lot of optimism in this report well and so what do you think specifically netflix is trading on right now gita continue to trade ten eleven percent higher the stock is down sixty percent this year is that that everybody was so negative on the company or is there something very specific that you would point to here i think what we were everybody was kind of really worried about was you know has subscriber growth really kind of hit that wall in just the fact that they were you know they did speak to a lot of those seasonal factors in one q and two q just the fact that they've been able to kind of reverse those trends and more than that where they've they've obviously beaten guidance beaten consensus estimates and now you do have a very very viable catalyst in terms of advertising uh... you know some of the engagement metrics that they put out in that letter those are huge engagement metrics those would be uh... you know that's a gold mine for them when they're trying to attract huge ad dollars which is exactly what they're trying to do so any advertiser would want to jump on that opportunity and so this kind of this report really sets them up i think so beautifully for that launch of that at year how is this the read across the industry as we're seeing Walt Disney roco one of brothers all lifted on the back of this enough to ask training as well gita or how much is this idiosyncratic specific to netflix i think a lot of it was specific to netflix because we saw subscriber growth kind of completely stall at netflix we were well where does we were seeing some of the other platforms uh... actually report growth but you have remembered they're all in different stages of their life cycle so obviously netflix is the earliest game in town uh... so they obviously had that huge first move over and back,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4332,2022-10-18 20:09:23
15987," actually report growth, but you have remembered they're all in different stages of their life cycle. So obviously Netflix is the earliest game in town. So they obviously had that huge first mover advantage. I think what it tells us is obviously there still are people who are going to be willing to subscribe to the service. The market opportunity is still pretty much there. These streaming services just kind of have to find ways now, creative ways of monetizing their audiences. They talk about competition. Saying that right now their competition is still losing money is they pivot from linear to streaming. But then they say ultimately we know that our competitors are going to build a sustainable profitable business. What is the competitive landscape that Netflix is really addressing here? Yeah, I mean they are looking at some of their competitors and we can talk about Disney of course. They have huge pieces of content. They have launched in almost all of the big markets. They just have huge global IP brands, but then you look at some of these other competitors and Amazon comes to mind. They've made some huge bets just in the third quarter alone with some of the pieces of content. Whether it was a lot of the rings for which they spent 700 million for just a single season or whether it was Thursday night football. You know, which again cost them over a billion dollars. Some of these big tech giants, especially with deep pockets are unafraid. They are willing to go big. So Netflix has to be able to position itself well against all of these competitors, whether it's the old media companies or some of these newer tech entrants. All right, we're going to leave it there. Geeta, thank you so much. Geeta Ringanatha who follows of course Netflix and the whole space for us. And so we're watching shares of Netflix here up with a 12.5% here in the after hours. All right, that's a wrap for our cross platform coverage on radio TV YouTube following Netflix into the after hours. And we will see you sometime, same place tomorrow. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this busy Tuesday. And so we're going to be doing a full semester along with Paul Swini in for my co host Tim Stenevick. We're going to continue with Netflix because this not holding on to its bump up in a big way in the after our still up about 11 12%. The big key headline jumping after third quarter subscribers beat expectations. And we've got a great guest to talk about it. Yeah, absolutely. It's bringing Dan Morgan, senior portfolio manager, Sonobus Trust Company. $25 billion in assets under management. He joins us on the phone from Atlanta. So, Dan, a pretty solid quarter from Netflix. I know there's a lot of hesitation in the marketplace because this company's, you know, about to embark upon a pivot to away from strictly subscription revenue to one that's not going to include advertising. But pretty good quarter here. Yeah, it looks like a really strong quarter. I mean, obviously the numbers were ahead of expectations in terms of the number of new subscribers at the out of the street was looking for one million. They did 2.41 million. And I think the key number for me guys was, I thought that estimate going into the fourth quarter, which was a little over 4 million was way over the way over the back fence. But they guided on this quarter that they're going to do 4.5 million in terms of number of new subscribers. So, it looks like at least they're getting their mojo back, right? Right. So, there are two consecutive quarters of negative subscriber growth. And of course, they, you know, bid on revenues. Looks like they got a bid on EPS. So, overall top line was only up 5.9%, but it was better than the foreign change that everyone was looking for. So, I think we have to walk away from this number with a sigh of relief. And that is, at least they didn't surprise us like they did last time, Carol. Right. When they came in with negative growth, I think you and I were trying to read the numbers and we didn't, we're not reading this right. I think we're looking at it, right? Say, wait, wait, is that a mistake? Is that a mistake? So, returning to growth, and we still don't even know about the ad supported tier, right? Because we haven't gotten numbers or forecasts on that yet. Yeah, I mean, ad situation is interesting because, you know, Netflix was always reluctant to go that route. Then they got kind of forced to do it because Disney Plus and HBO have both gone that route. My understanding is it's going to between, roughly, $6 to $8 per month. They're only going to do advertising breaks, maybe three to four times during an hour program. So, you know, it's going to be a lot of work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4333,2022-10-18 20:13:46
15988, ending is going to be between the roughly six to eight dollars per month or only going to do advertising breaks maybe three to four times during an hour program so it'll be interesting though because you know my concern is guys are people that are paying twenty five dollars a month gonna just go you know i haven't really ordered any new dvd so last couple weeks i'm just gonna shuttle down to this new six fifty at supported model and i'll just kind of what leave the room when the ads come on so you know it's not a guarantee is gonna work you know crisp almerie uh... from bloomberg news is reporting that uh... netflix bought an ad into nights opening night of nba basketball i think on tb s teasing some of their sports programming you know some documentaries and things do you think that netflix will get ever kind of jump into that big sports rights business and will see nfl on some of this some of the streaming you know it's interesting we've had other people try to do that right twitter tried to do that remember that they're coming from nfl stuff like monday night footballer there's a night football and never really seem to pay off for them right to could get people to stay watching it so i don't know if that's really netflix's game but i guess they're trying to play with it a little bit see if people will bite on it to me it's still guys going out there spent seventeen billion a year getting those those those series that last forever and hooking you to stay on board but we'll see if they get in the sports game to be interesting if they did well you know we talk about law of uh... large numbers here i mean their content slate and i love our live blog in the third quarter specially strong for season of stranger things generated one point thirty five billion hours viewed that was followed in august by the sandman three hundred fifty one million hours viewed uh... they talk about kobra kai two hundred seventy million hours viewed and monster the jeffrey doma story eight hundred twenty four million hours viewed the second largest english language series ever i mean you know dan they have been so much about content we constantly talk about content content content content well they've been given it to us and you're right girl and i think that's really showing up in these uh... subscriber growth numbers right in the fact that they were offering these shows that people are watching i mean boom they doubled the estimate right to point four million uh... compared to a little over a million so i think we're seeing that come into play here in regards to the fact that content is driving that top-line membership you know number and then what's the uh... what's the lay of the land do you think of the competitive environment because we've got disney uh... and pretty much every other media company out there with a streaming service in the else in the to name them a plus i'm not sure why but so there's competition out there you know what's interesting is you look at these companies you put them all together right you look at uh... disney plus you look at the new spin-off right uh... which was one of brothers discovery you got a lot plus amazon apple we put them all together they're spending ten billion dollars in uh... content between all of them just a compete against netflix and i don't know about me but it's almost getting the point where it's like the airline industry right meaning it's so competitive it's so hard there's so much cost up front to getting the content everybody fighting it out i'm just wondering if some of these late entrance are going to be able to find enough space right now for the market is streaming and it's increasing but you know it's just be a thing to see how netflix kind of stacks up in the future against the other if it starts to maybe clear down a little bit where some of these competitors just can't make it hey listen uh... we're also getting uh... heads up at netflix will stop giving a forecast for subscribe subscriber growth starting next quarter it will however continue to provide revenue operating income and net income guidance um... what's up with that how do you feel about that is someone who's got to follow the company that's a key metric well it's really tough care because you know this quarter they did guide right we said four point five million on the fourth quarter that was a book consensus at four that made everybody feel really good about the stock you go into a little bit of a black hole where it's like okay well i appreciate you guys give me guidance on revenues and deluded eps and net income and that's all great but how do i work those numbers out to come up with what's your actual uh... new subscribers is it's kind of like with apple you know when they dropped giving the unit volume forecast on the iphone but we still all know what it is we're all watching it because they back the number out so i guess people have to do that with netflix too and then it looks like this company starting this year but looking at the ff,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4334,2022-10-18 20:18:07
15989, know what it is we're all watching it because they back the number out so I guess people have to do that with Netflix too. And Dan it looks like this company starting this year just looking at the FA function on the Bloomberg terminal and it got some consensus forecast. Gonna put up some free cash flow this year and then really kind of see that grow pretty dramatically the next several years. Is that how important is that for the stock or is this still a company or still a stock that's kind of driven by the top line? Now you hit it on the button there which is before it was growth at all cost right they were taking on a lot of long term debt they were running negative free cash flow just to drive that top line and get new subscribers through their shows but now they're kind of retrenching back and you mentioned before this year the target for free cash flow is about roughly about a billion in positive free cash flow they were running in the red before that content about 17 billion and then as they move forward into 2023 they're looking for about 2.7 billion free cash flow and then 24.4 billion cash flow so I think this sets the stage Paul and Carol for the future for them which is how do you monetize the 222 million subscribers that you have right you want to generate all a cash flow you want to be able to to make as much money as you can offer them in case your subscriber growth starts to go down again so this free cash flow numbers huge because what do you do with free cash flow you buy shares or you can issue a dividend right that's right it certainly gives you some breathing room we got to leave it there Dan Morgan thank you so much senior portfolio manager at Cenovus Trust Company joining us on the phone from Atlanta I love our Lucas Shaw writing Netflix is growing again and Hollywood can breathe a sigh of relief and you're definitely seeing it in terms of investors that's Lucas's beat Hollywood so and he's he lives in Breeze that he really does and talk about sighing you know and having some peace because anybody was trying to be bullish on this name they're getting some happiness here in the after hours because the stock is up more than 14% here as we speak so pretty much and it's highs here in the aftermarket all right let's get back to some of the news after the closing bell those closing numbers on Wall Street here is once again I thank her very much Carol master indeed Netflix certainly the major story the major earnings story after the close of trading but a couple of other big well-known companies also reporting united airlines out with adjusted EPS for the third quarter that also beat the average analyst estimate united chairs taking off after our soaring now by just about 9% so we're keeping an eye on united on the ground trucker JB Hunt reported earnings per share for the for the third quarter that also beat the average analyst estimate but again though Netflix the major story there as we have been reporting an earnings beat from Netflix after our shares up by 14% back to back gains today for the S&P 500 index stocks continued their rebound from nearly oversold levels traders assessed prospects for earnings growth against a backdrop of rising rates 10 year yield 3.99 percent 2 year 4.43 percent the Dow the S&P NASDAQ all higher today with the S&P up 42 again there of 1.1 percent the Dow also up by 1.1 percent today NASDAQ up 96 again there of 9 tenths of 1% spot gold up one tenth of 1% 16 51 the ounce West Texas in immediate crude down 2.6 percent today 83 21 or barrel I'm Charlie Pelton that is a Bloomberg business flash got a mention at Netflix now up more than 15 percent I can just see on the Bloomberg tomorrow the story is going to be like Netflix if it holds on to this how much it's going to add to its market because right now it would be a lot I'm earlier this year Bloomberg news reported on how female founders raise Paul just 2% of venture capital in the U.S. last year that was the smallest share since 2016 and it's really a sign that efforts to really diversify the famously male dominated industry I mean continues to struggle it's an old story unfortunately no it's a frustrating one because there has been lots of efforts over the years yeah financial services to change that narrative around and it just never seems to get that real tracks and particularly in Silicon Valley all right so we have a great guest on this and working on that gap that persists there between men and women especially when it comes to raising VC money Ruth Fox Blader she is partner at Anthemist it's a fintech venture capital firm she's lived and worked around the globe she joins us on the phone from San Francisco Ruth good to have you here with Paul and myself how are you and first of all let's just get to the crux of this why is it still so difficult for women to launch companies and access capital and get some help here yeah I mean I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4335,2022-10-18 20:22:22
15990," Get to the crux of this. Why is it still so difficult for women to launch companies in access capital and get some help here? Yeah, I mean, I think, and first of all, thank you so much for having me today. I think that it's a really simple answer in some ways to somewhat complex question. The answer is really discrimination. And this is kind of systemic discrimination that women face and also kind of bilateral day to day discrimination. I think where I'm really encouraged is that I have a portfolio, which is all of outstanding female founders. I am a partner in the venture capital practice that anthemists so a little bit against all odds myself. And I have a lot of optimism, but you know, also we have a lot of work to do. And Ruth, one of the things when I think about the venture capital firm, you know, you think of places like, you know, Sand Hill Road out in Silicon Valley, it's just it feels, it looks, it sounds very insular. Like if I can't raise my capital from some of those people out in the valley, I know it's getting better with Austin's of the world and think things like that. But boy, if I can't make it there, it's hard to make it anywhere in the VC world. Is that changing at all? Yeah, I think it is particularly for the sector that I look at, which is financial services, London and New York and Singapore and places, you know, where the markets really are, have always been quite vibrant venture capital scenes. I think that the diversification though that you're talking about of venture capital and where it lives, the geographic diversification certainly has a role to play in diversifying the founders that we invest in. There's a sort of sense that venture capital came from a small group of people who are looking to invest in people that look like them. For me, this is just completely counterintuitive. Venture capital is a game of exceptions. You're looking for exceptional companies that are going to beat a lot of odds and really kind of, you know, strange stories, interesting founders. So how would you get those exceptional outcomes if you keep investing in people that, you know, look the same and have the same kind of pedigree? It doesn't really make any sense. You know, somebody once said to me a few years ago that what you need is more women to create a Google or an Apple or so and so forth and then the money will come. Is that what it's about? Is it that simple or difficult? You know, there really are some exceptional female founders that have raised an enormous amount of capital and also run huge companies. So I don't think that we should, you know, it's quite exceptional for anyone to build a company at that scale, right? I think we probably need more women in venture capital. This is something that I've been working on in a lot of different places, both at Anthemist and also in another organization that I've been working on in Europe. I think that female investors tend to back diverse founders. So I think this is one kind of simple band-aid solution, but I think it's also generally just a sense that venture capital and great ideas can come from anywhere and can really stem from any background, any diverse background and probably the more diverse and more likely people are to have outsized impact. So Ruth, I do a lot of work with Duke University's Graduate School of Business and in their venture capital fund, their private equity fund, their alternative investment funds, teams, there's a lot of women represented. What happens? Where do you tend to lose them, if you will. Where does it not translate? Again, I see a lot of demand at the university level. Yeah, it's a tough question for me to answer because I really do invest in a much more diverse way than many of my peers. I think that sometimes women will self-select out. This is something which has been studied and shown not only in venture capital, but in other fields that there are certain demands or expectations of demands around building a startup where women feel like it's incompatible with other choices that they might make. Similarly, I've spoken with a lot of women on their path to partner and venture capital firms who say the same thing. Will this be compatible with having a family? I think it absolutely can be. I think we probably need some more support structures and also kind of deeper understanding amongst the LP and GP world of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4336,2022-10-18 20:26:33
15991," It absolutely can be. I think we probably need some more support structures and also kind of deeper understanding amongst the LP and GP world of what it takes and how we can create support for exceptional people to bring exceptional ideas to life. It's really never the founder alone who does that. So how do we help founders create teams which are more sustainable and allow them to achieve a lot of their different goals and objectives? That's right. You know, one answer. I think, obviously, there's also just a funding gap. Yeah, we certainly see it continue to play out. Ruth Fox Blader, partner at Anthem is joining us on the phone from San Francisco. Continue to watch Netflix. It's up to shy of 14% in the after hours following earnings. This is Blueburg. Here we go. Here you come. So it's really hard to reach, but it's so much of an idea in a fourth- Ian's kitchen. Get ready. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4337,2022-10-18 20:31:32
15992," Let's go home.. Broadcasting live from the Bloomberg interactive broker, studio in New York, Bloomberg 1130 to Washington, D.C. Bloomberg 991, to Boston, Bloomberg 1061, to San Francisco, Bloomberg 960, to the country, Syria 6M, Cheta 119. And around the globe, the Bloomberg and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Tuesday live in our radio studio and of course on YouTube. Coming up, it is among the most red stories on the Bloomberg. We're going to talk about the COVID billionaires and where they are now. We'll get to that in just a moment. First up, back to your top business stories and a lot of earnings after the closed big ones. Indeed, indeed, absolutely right about that. Carol got to begin with Netflix shares surging now by just about 14% after ours. So we've got Netflix rallying. Hollywood breathing a sigh of relief as Wall Street is as well with the streaming leader adding 2.41 million subscribers in the third quarter. Exceeding internal forecasts as well as expectations on Wall Street. Dan Morgan is Senior Portfolio Manager with Sonovus Trust. He was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. It looks like at least they're getting their mojo back after 2 consecutive quarters of negative subscriber growth. And of course they beat on revenues. Looks like they got a beat on EPS. Overall, top line was only up 5.9%, but it was better than the foreign change that everyone was looking for. So I think we'd have to walk away from this number with a sigh of relief. And also sifting through the numbers after ours, Geitha Raganatham, who follows media stocks for Bloomberg Intelligence. They're finally back to growth, which is really good. And their guidance right now again, pretty much in line. And what's really encouraging to me about that 4Q guidance is that they say that they've really not baked in any of those ad tier expectations. So there is potentially a lot of upside to that guidance as well. And again, after our shares now up by about 13% stocks today, regain lost ground with the back-to-back rally, S&P 500 index up 42 points up by 1.1% that out today up 337 up 1.1% and as stack up 96 again, they're of 9.10% of 1%. The 2-year yield 4.42%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4338,2022-10-18 20:35:29
15993, Today up 337 of 1.1% now stack up 96 again there of 9.10 of 1%. The two year yield 4.42% the 10 year 4.00% spot gold up $1.38 the ounce to 16.51 up by 1.10% the 1% West Texas. In the media crude oil today felt 2.4% now at 83.40. A barrel very briefly after ours also keeping an eye on UAL United Airlines reporting adjusted EPS for the third quarter that beat the average annual estimate UAL shares up by roughly 9% after ours. I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flat. Quite a boost in both United and Netflix following their earnings or something will follow certainly into the Wednesday trade. Hey listen I do want to get to the Bloomberg big take and it is a most read on the Bloomberg easily a most read and it is stayed atop the list and you can understand why with a headline like this with more on the extraordinary rise in the fall of the covid billionaires let's get to Brian Chappata his Bloomberg news America's wealth team leader and he's here in our Bloomberg interactive broker studio. The big take by the way you can find it on the Bloomberg and at Bloomberg dot com slash big take incredible story and I feel like we have spent so much time talking about kind of the pandemic economy and those who benefited and the post pandemic economy which has brought a lot of those who benefited the people who run those companies who were made really wealthy. Their wealth looks a lot differently on the other side of the pandemic. Yeah it was really interesting this was a whole collaboration with the wealth team globally. We have our Bloomberg billionaires index of course which tracks all the billionaires out there. We identified 189 of them that well their wealth doubled between December 31st 2019 and you know at some point in 2021 and of those we identified 58 which we did the term called covid billionaires because they were directly based on the pandemic helped their fortunes rise right so it was really interesting you can it's kind of hard to visualize the graph over radio but you can just see the super surge in wealth. It's like a good mountain to ski. Yeah basically. I mean I mean it's more than a black diamond on the way down I mean it's pretty incredible honestly. Their precipitous decline basically since October of November of last year once there was kind of a flip in part because of the federal reserve but also because the delta wave was receding and all of a sudden all these fortunes that were made suddenly evaporated in a hurry. Yeah I feel like Brian we talk about that whether it's a peloton a zoom or the most logical let's talk about like the pharmaceuticals and I think constantly I still find myself talking a lot about Moderna. It's often a big escape or a big as to Cliner depending on the market day. Let's talk about that head of that company because he made a lot of money. Yeah I mean you can look at the peak net worth during covid 15 billion dollars and now the net worth as of September 30th was 3.7 that's a decline of 75%. He was just another scientist. Step on concept. Yes from France he was just another scientist kind of trying to make his way and all of a sudden in Massachusetts obviously the biotech capital of the country and then all of a sudden covid hit and suddenly he had the technology to kind of make a vaccine right so as we've seen there was a huge push into Moderna the stock price sword but ultimately now it's come crashing back down because obviously covid's were seeing a little bit. Yeah it was pretty fascinating I felt like it was a company that really wasn't on anybody's radar and the company as well as their CEO was everywhere and I know we all talk to him a lot. Zoom is another one that was this incredible pandemic play and it's still a big part of people's lives but maybe not as much so. Yeah I think one of the interesting things about Eric Yuan who who run zoom is that he gave away actually a good portion of of his fortune kind of around the peak and that's kind of one of the things that we've been interested in is you know when you look back at these past two or three years the tremendous fortunes that were made I mean they were all on paper right like what did they do with them so you look at Eric Yuan and he gave away actually a good portion of his fortune which is good because his network changes down 84% since the peak another person who is interesting to watch is Ernie Garcia of Carvana he's another one of our covid billionaires obviously if you can't go outside and you need to get a car car vending machines that are delivered straight to you is a really good business model who would have thought that he actually started selling a bunch of shares kind of around the peak in a summer of twenty twenty one so that's another one where he actually cashed in on some of those paper gains,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4339,2022-10-18 20:39:38
15994," She started selling a bunch of shares kind of around the peak in a summer of 2021. So that's another one where he actually cashed in on some of those paper gains. Talked us about maybe some of the not so familiar, maybe to the Bloomberg audience, but I think of whether it's some of the big CEOs over in Asia that actually also just hit it big during the pandemic. Yeah, I mean, I think about bomb Kim of Copang and often dubbed Korea's Amazon, right? I mean, that sticks out, obviously. You saw how Jeff Bezos is fortune surge during the pandemic. If you're trying to order things from home and not go outside, again, it's the perfectly set up company. And it's just the tail of a lot of these companies is just they were in the right place at the right time for an unfortunately really tragic pandemic. Right. And so you've seen the tremendous surge in fortunes. But then I mean, now that things are getting back to something resembling normal, all of a sudden, nobody really, no one wants to zoom anymore. This will still zoom, will still zoom, but it's not necessarily going to be the end all be all of conferencing. This is what you do. You guys track the billionaires in their wealth and it's really pretty dramatic to see what some people had made of the height of the pandemic and then coming down on the other side of it. But you have a stat in the story too that says there are now about 97 million more people living in less than a dollar, 90 a day because of the pandemic. And that's a World Bank report. There's the other side of this just quickly. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of the other thing right is that COVID has been, has been, has been really rough for, for a lot of people and it just exacerbated inequality to a large part, you know, even those stocks have come back down. You know, a lot of the people who, who had a lot of money in the stock market made a ton of money. And whereas other people were a little less fortunate. I do feel like one of the stories that we constantly talk about is the increasing gap between the haven't have nots. It's always there, but it's really gotten a much bigger divide. Brian Jepada, incredible reporting. And as I said, among the most red and it's a Bloomberg big take, Brian is America's well team leader at Bloomberg News here in our interactive broker studio. All right, back to World of National News and Denise Pellegrini, Denise All yours. All right. Thank you, Carol. I've got a question for you. Does it seem more crowded out there if you're in Manhattan today because Castle System says office occupancy in Manhattan has just hit the highest level since the start of the pandemic? Massive white tents opening on Randall's Island today. It is temporary shelter for migrants from Central and South America. President Biden promising American voters. If Democrats keep control of Congress, he will ensure abortion is legal across the country by law. The first bill that I will send to the Congress will be to codify Roe v Wade. And when Congress passes it, I'll sign it in January 50 years after all is first decided to law the land. And by then speaking at an event hosted by the Democratic National Committee, Senate Democrats say if the GOP dominates in the coming midterms, Ukraine's efforts to repel Russia could be hurt. Virginia Senator Mark Warner. I do fear that there is this Trump-led America alone contingent that could have greatly increased power in the House and a Republican House next year could undermine that support. And Warner with us there on balance power and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy says Republicans will pull back on a to Ukraine if they do gain control of the House. McDonald's testing new treats offering crispy cream donuts at some of its stores as handhelds and also in six packs. McDonald's trying to offer cheaper menu items for cash strapped consumers. And United Passengers at Newark Airport reporting a snake on board. No one injured by that non-vetamous snake, but passengers did report hearing some shrieking from business class as the flight from Tampa taxi to the gate. And as we've been talking about, some shrieking at Yankee Stadium in baseball right now. Yankee's beating Cleveland. Three and no. Global news. I'm Denise Peligrini. This is Bloomberg. Yeah, they're shrieking on Madison Avenue. Because the stores are back. Yes, the stores are back. So more stores are filling vacancies on Manhattan's Madison Avenue, a sign that the key shopping corridor is starting to bounce back after they have pandemic Natalie Wong and Christian Richie have that story. That's good. I mean, because boy, you just thought that that was one of the areas that was immune. Immune, exactly, but it was not certainly. Well, I have to say for anybody's not in New York or right, and not familiar. So Madison Avenue is rather posh, it's very high and it's very exclusive and. And depending upon tourism for a big thing. Exactly. And if you have to ask, like you should probably shouldn't be shopping there, but we thought it was pretty immune. Retail tenants apparently have been snapping up spots on Madison Avenue, pushing the air around these products. Don't be late.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4340,2022-10-18 20:44:17
15995," for a big thing. Exactly. And if you have to ask like you should probably shouldn't be shopping there, but we thought it was pretty immune. Retail 10, tenants apparently have been snapping up spots on Madison Avenue, pushing the available space down to roughly 18% in the third quarter. And Paul, that's the lowest since 2018 is according to a report by Jones laying a cell. Okay. And just a little bit closer to home. One couple blocks closer right here at the Bloomberg office were on Lexington Avenue between 58 and 59. And there's lots of retail space on the ground floors of all the buildings and our little block here. And basically I would say 80% left. 90% left. The only thing that stayed was this little Swiss chocolate company that survived. Which I often at the end of the day I buy a little chunk. I think it's arrived. It's always 80 full in there. Even when the pandemic had this kind of shut down people were masking up and social distancing to so they get their chocolate. But everybody else left now. We're starting to get some of those spaces filling up again, which is good news. Even our Bloomberg News team wrote about this area in particular because banana public scone gap is gone Victoria Secrets gone. The container store H&M left. I mean, it's unbelievable. And you know, the other story we did earlier about, you know, the office buildings are only about 50% occupied with workers. And I don't know if that number materially changes in the next few years. I would believe that it maybe it would not. And so the businesses that depend upon that. What do they do? I don't know. I mean, I know your big believer like come in. Just get back to the office at this point. I'm out of it. I'm totally I'm glad I'm not managing anybody. It's not easy because there is definitely some different feelings among different populations about getting to work. I think it's going to be flexible, but we'll see longer term.

From Bloomberg World headquarters, I'm Charlie Pettit, screaming leader Netflix, growing again, and it is getting rave reviews after ours from Wall Street. Shares up now by 13.5% Netflix added 2.41 million customers in the third quarter exceeding internal forecast. Also moving higher United Airlines, it's out with adjusted EPS for the third quarter that beat analyst estimates. UAL after ours up now by about seven and a half percent. Trucker J.B. Hunt reported earnings for per share for the third quarter that also be estimates. Shares of J.B. Hunt right now looking on the Bloomberg up by about 2.9%. The Dow, the S&P, now stack all events today back to back gains for the S&P 500 index stocks. Regaining some lost ground, S&P up 42 up 1.1%. The Dow today up 337, also up 1.1%.

I'm Charlie Peloton, that is a Bloomberg business flash. Bloomberg Business Week is brought to you by S.E.I. Imagine your asset management firms operational infrastructure as a competitive advantage. Let S.E.I. show you how at S.E.I.C.com slash I.M.S. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. Carol Masser along with Paul Sweeney, Tim Stenevek will be back tomorrow. In the meantime, this is something Paul and I've been talking about a lot about use of office space, hybrid working. And our next guest in this company, I found out that an overwhelming majority of CFOs are cost cutting amid rising inflation and recession concern. So does this mean but by corporate offices? Exactly. All right, with us via Zoom from the gorgeous principality of Monica, Mark Dixon, Founder and C.E.I.I.W.G. International Workplace Group. Hey, Mark, good to have you here with Paul and myself. So tell us about the growth that you guys are seeing because I think you're at what, 8 million in growing across more than 120 countries. Tell us about the metrics so we can all understand what's going on in terms of how people are working. Well, look, it's a, this is a change that began pre-the pandemic and companies were already changing, making more use of technology, working more remotely, working in a more distributed fashion. The pandemic accelerated the adoption of this new way of working and it's continued to grow after. As you said, CFOs today are, you know, they're reviewing any cost they can cut. They feel there's a recession coming on in much of the developed world. Workers are asking for a different way to work and, you know, the focus on cost-cutting and then a focus on delivering what workers seem to want has meant that more and more companies are adopting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4342,2022-10-18 20:52:35
15997," focus on cost-cutting and then a focus on delivering what workers seem to want has meant that more and more companies are adopting hybrid working that is allowing people to work closer where they live. I mean the real change here is that people just are reluctant to commute. They're reluctant to spend an hour, two hours, sometimes three hours a day commuting. They're great cost to go into an office to use a laptop or computer which they could have done from an office down the road. So it's a radical change and it's a change that is affecting many, many companies and many people. Hey Mark, I'm in the old school that kind of sees the benefit of coming into the office and building that camaraderie and so on. But I fully understand the other side because boy the productivity of the global workforce and here at Bloomberg we focus a lot on Wall Street. Just the Wall Street industry was able to be so productive while working from home. It just blew me away. I mean that probably as much as anything is an argument for embracing some kind of hybrid work or work from home. Were you surprised by the productivity? Yeah well look I've said this many times, companies didn't fall over during the pandemic. They didn't fall over because their workers didn't come to a central office and productivity for many companies improved. I think look just coming to your comment on camaraderie. Very very important is the psychology of the workers themselves and making sure they're at the most productive. Now modern companies, the most advanced companies are adopting hybrid work but they're not just using as a way to cut costs. Look hybrid work will reduce your cost by at least 50% and reduce your carbon footprint by 70%. That's well rehearsed. The numbers are very clear but companies reinvest some of that money into better workplace workforce management, bringing people together more regularly, investing more in people as opposed to investing less in real estate, more in people. We've talked over the past year about things moving from real estate to HR. The whole emphasis has moved. Mark let me just jump in because we've only got about three minutes or so. You are incredible and I love talking with you. The thing is though you point out that this hybrid model was starting before the pandemic. Pandemic definitely accelerated and I do wonder if coming off the pandemic, it's at the same rate of what we saw in the pandemic, it's back to pre-pandemic levels or is it picking up some momentum? I'm trying to get an idea of if increasingly people are leading into this hybrid model and you see it directly because you guys are continuing to expand. Give me an idea. It's picking up momentum. Look, it's the economics of it that really move it. Companies are extremely focused on the cost base. For obvious reasons, both rising costs and potentially a recession coming up, then workers are asking to work in a different way. It's the economics and the demand from workers and everyone wants to hire the best workers. Those two things are driving rapid change. The adoption is increasing. It's not going down. Mark, how about compensation? If I'm at Tech CEO and I pay my worker in San Francisco a certain wage, then he or she relocates the Iowa. Do I need to pay the same wage? Well, that's a very good question. Look, the whole of this new way of working is developing and developing quickly. The protocols of how you operate a company in this new way are just being developed as we speak, more and more companies are dots. Yes, there is a variation sometimes in salaries. In the end, what it comes down to is productivity. An efficiency in carrying out a task for a company. It's a new world. It's developing quickly. The software is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4343,2022-10-18 20:56:46
15998," and efficiency in actually carrying out a task for a company. So it's a new world, it's developing quickly. The software is there, the backbone of all of this is the internet and the software behind it. But and the protocols as they develop, well, it will adjust things like pay. Hey, we just got about 30, 40 seconds left, here Mark. Mike, the pressures on companies to continue to reduce their carbon footprint might that be another big catalyst over the next few years that forces more companies to do more hybrid. And again, just got about 30, 40 seconds here. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I think the elephant in the room is the environment. I mean, basically costs come first. But the environment and sustainability is also an important driver. You know, moving to hybrid will reduce carbon footprint by about 70%. And it improves the overall ESG scores on many things, including workers' content than happiness. So definitely a driver. Yeah, you definitely feel it with a lot of workers who say, I want more balance. I don't really spend any time commuting for hours. And I want that flexibility. Mark, always welcome. Love to hear from you. Mark Dixon, founder and CEO at IWG Global International Workplace Group, joining SV Zoom from Monica. Right? Like it makes you think. Yes, it certainly does. I mean, it's tough to argue against. It really is. And I'll be interested to see how this really evolves. And whether different industries embrace it differently. Yeah. And workers growing out of the pandemic, just saying it. This is the way I want to do it. Hey, folks, Netflix shares still up to shy of 14% in the after hours shares of United Airlines UAL up about 7% pulse-sweeney. Always love having you. Always love being here. Catch Paul in the morning on surveillance and on Bloomberg markets. Have a great and safe evening, everyone. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4344,2022-10-18 21:01:29
15999," afraid is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Hi, Emily Chang in New York, and this is Bloomberg Technology. Coming up in the next hour, Hollywood breeds a sigh of relief. Netflix is growing again. Expectations were low after the streaming giant lost the subscribers last quarter and suddenly pivoted to ads. What's working? We'll discuss. Plus, women are leaving the top ranks of companies at higher rates than ever before, according to a new report from McKinsey and Lean In. What they're calling the great breakup later this hour. And why has Zuck been so quiet about Facebook these days? The Meta CEO seems to be ignoring his flagship social network to focus on lowering people into a vacant virtual world. We're going to get to all of that in a moment, but first I want to get a look at the markets, tech stocks, climbing for a second day. As we head into a key earning season, Bloomberg's at Ludlow here with the biggest moves. Ed? Yeah, we're backed back to back game for the NASDAQ 100, but it's the first backed back game for tech stocks in around two weeks. And as you say, we've come into this with a pretty high level of anxiety looking ahead to earning season, broadly tech underperformed, the broader S&P 500 while yields creeped higher. A story that we want to get to straight away is that of Apple, really interesting. The information reporting, according to people familiar with the matter, that Apple was cut production of the iPhone 14, which certainly impacted Apple shares, but remember, Apple accounts from a waiting perspective for 7% of the S&P 500. So it had a real sort of jittery effect in markets. So the S&P 500 pair some of its losses. But you can see on the screen, they're pretty sharp drop, pretty big knee-juck. I know Bloomberg's reported as well, some of the difficulty Apple has had in managing its suppliers when it comes to the level of production for the iPhone 14. We are in the thick of earnings season M. Here it is. Get ready, Netflix reporting almost double what it expected in terms of subscriber growth in the third quarter. You see those shares now higher, 14% in after hours. This Tuesday, other names in the world are streaming Disney, Roku, also pushing higher. I know you're going to get into Lucas right now about your favorite show. Mine was the TV series remake of Resident Evil. Make of that what you will. But I think what is also interesting here is Netflix saying that after the current quarter, fourth quarter, it's no longer going to guide us forward or forecast subscriber growth. So like Apple does with its iPhone units, there's going to be an element of guessing game here. Maybe they learned from their mistakes of either being too positive or too conservative in what they've said before. Ed, you really put me on the spot. I'm thinking Bridgeton, but that came out so long ago. They need a new one. They need a new one. OK. And thank you for more on Netflix. I want to bring in Bloomberg's Lucas shot. OK. Lucas, what are the good things you're seeing in this report? Why are we seeing a turnaround? Before a lot of these new changes have even been put into effect. Well, it's growing again. So it added 2.4 million subscribers in the most recent quarter. That's way above. But they forecast way above. But Wall Street forecast, they also estimated 4.5 million additions in the fourth quarter. So Netflix is still going to have its worst year in a really long time. But people had been jittery because it had shrunk for two quarters in a row. The fact that it's growing again is seen as a positive sign. The fact that it has all these hit shows that came out in the most recent quarter, also a positive sign. If you wanted to be a bit of a pass.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4345,2022-10-18 21:05:48
16000," Two quarters in a row, the fact that it's growing again, is seen as a positive sign, the fact that it has all these hit shows that came out in the most recent quarter, also a positive sign. If you wanted to be a bit of a pessimist, you could say why did they only add 2.4 million when it had all those hits? And that's a legitimate question. But I think there was, you know, the response to it slowed on had been so dramatic that a lot of people are just breathing a sigh of relief that it seems to be back on a more stable trajectory. Now, what do we know about the ad supported tier? And how is that impacting your outlook on how much better we can get here? Well, it's going to release the new tier or start selling it in November. It'll cost $7 a month. You'll watch about 4 or 5 minutes of commercials per hour. Most of the programs that people watch or care about will be available, but not all you won't have ads in new movies. You won't have ads and kids programming, although you may have sort of a pre-roll ad, just not ads in the middle of it. And so that means that Netflix's ad tier is cheaper than HBO Max's ad tier, cheaper than Disney Plus's forthcoming ad tier, a little more expensive than some of the smaller rivals. I think people are pretty optimistic that this should boost the company's performance in the years ahead at the very least give people a reason not to cancel. But Netflix is saying it doesn't expect to see any material impact on its business in the fourth quarter, more likely in the coming year. It could, of course, just be trying to manage expectations. What about when it comes to the content strategy? I mentioned Bridgeton is my favorite show, but it, but you know, it's been a while. And they talked about Monster, the Jeffrey Dahmer story. What are you seeing as kind of the next generation of big Netflix hits? Well, I think there's the perception and then there's the reality, right? There's a perception in the marketplace right now that programming on Netflix has gotten a lot worse that their funding lots of bad shows, bad movies, and that people have moved on to HBO Max, to Apple TV Plus, to Disney Plus. And while I think there's some truth to that, that an even Netflix has said that perhaps it's making too much, for the most part, Netflix is still making a lot of shows that people want to watch. It had movies in the gray man and purple hearts that people watched. It had Dahmer, which was one of its biggest tips. It had the new season of Stranger Things. It had this Korean show, Extraordinary Attorney Wu that was hugely popular. And so I think you'll see a lot more of that. Netflix just making a wide range of shows that appealed to people on the coast, so people in the middle of the country, people all over the world. And we'll see over time if they're doing enough to get people to come in. I think there's also a lot of concern about how much Netflix is spending on marketing, and the company is just starting to adjust its approach there. So what are folks saying in Hollywood? Obviously Netflix isn't doing all of this in VACU. We've got all of the competitors out there making their changes as well. Well, I think people are on the one hand relieved because Netflix's problems had impacted the stock price and the strategy for a lot of its competitors. So even though they are rivals to one another, nobody wants to see Netflix collapse because every other company is basically bet their future on streaming. At the same time, you do hear a lot of the whispers and snickers about the quality of programming on Netflix and how it's not as good as it used to be and not as fun as it used to be. Like I said, I think there's some truth to that, but some of that is also just a little bit of lack of understanding about people are actually watching. But we'll also see in the next few weeks what the results are like from Warner Brothers Discovery with HBO Max, from Disney with Disney Plus. Unfortunately, we don't really get numbers for Apple TV and Amazon broken out. But the positive results for Netflix should be a sign that if you can program well, there's still plenty of growth to be had in streaming. So look, obviously, we're in the middle of a major macroeconomic downturn. You have consumers reevaluating the priorities, how many subscriptions do we really want to have? There's been a big reset in the content business. Where do you think this stands? Let's say a year from now, how does this all shake out? Well, the big question is at what point some of these players decide that they be better off consolidating? You talked about people being more sensitive with how much they're spending. I think even the most optimistic person would say that people don't want to have to pay for more than four or five streaming services. And there are a number of services going for that mass scale. So does that mean that a Paramount Plus Warner Brothers Discovery with HBO Max, a peacock from NBC Universal, do some of those companies consolidate in some way? We've already seen Disney and Fox come together. We've already seen Viacom and CBS come together. There's been a lot of speculation that at some point there will be bigger deals. We just don't know when. All right.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4346,2022-10-18 21:10:14
16001," We've already seen Viacom and CBS come together. There's been a lot of speculation that at some point there will be bigger deals. We just don't know when. All right, Lukasha. Thank you, as always, for your analysis and insights here. Appreciate it. Coming up, not a lot of IPOs lately, but some updates on potential public offerings from mobile, I and Instacardomist, massive valuation cuts. We'll tell you more. Next, this is Bloomberg. Intel's self-driving technology company mobilized targeting evaluation far below previous expectations for its IPO. Intel had recently lowered its expected valuation of mobile I from 50 billion to 30 billion due to turbulent market conditions. Now that's closer to 16 billion. We've discussed our Bloomberg deals reporter, Crystal Z. Clearly, the market condition is not helping here, but what's behind another evaluation cut? Yeah, so basically IPO takes a long time to prepare. They probably came up with the idea of listing this unit, mobile I, when market was dobooming. Right now, it's went from 50 to 16. And 16, I would like to say, it's not probably the final valuation. We launched with a range. You think it could go lower? It could go higher. It could go lower. If we're optimistic, we think it could go higher. But it's not the final valuation. And we will know next week when they actually do price deal. And are you expecting them to go ahead with this? I mean, is there any kind of cold feet on the other side? Like, maybe we shouldn't do this right now. So if the market on the pricing day falls on a day like today, where things are doing OK, they could well go ahead. But everything is market dependent. It could just price on a day where everything is in the red. And it would just be a total disaster. And we shall see. But right now, I think they have the intention to go ahead with this listing. And what is the exact timeline? We should expect a listing next week, perhaps middle of the week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4347,2022-10-18 21:14:33
16002," You shall see, but right now I think they have the intention to go ahead with this listing. And what is the exact timeline? We should expect a listing next week, perhaps middle of the week. There's this question of, you know, the unprofitable IPO and whether that era is coming to an end. And obviously, you've covered so many IPOs in boom times and now you're covering the lack thereof. You know, how are companies thinking about strategy in terms of what they want to get out of a public offering? Yeah, so anyone who has raised money in the past year when valuation was still good, when money was still available, will unlikely be looking at an IPO. I think the mentality very much right now is that if you don't have to do it, don't do it. And I'm sure that's what the bankers are advising their clients as well. But if you're a company like mobile eye where you have a parent company that is looking to return some money, then you would go ahead with this listing. But for people who have a choice, they will most likely not. So that also give it an interesting power dynamic. If you're an investor and you know that this company needs to go public, you have more pricing power. So how long does the drought last in your view? Well, a lot of bankers are saying that we should expect the rest of the year to be quiet or even the first quarter of 2023. So we will likely see some deals coming back meaningfully in the second quarter of 23. And it would most likely start with companies that are potentially revenue positive or even profitable, the things that we have covered in the last year where they have no revenue, they have no profit, those who have the weight. All right, Kristallzi, we'll keep checking back in with you and see if the timeline changes. Thank you. I want to move on to another IPO that's been highly anticipated that is Instacart. Let's bring in Adam Burmbham to discuss. He's the executive director at GP Bullhound, a tech advisory and investment firm with a billion dollars under management. So Instacart, Adam, another one that's had massive valuation cuts, I believe it was valued at $39 billion at the height of its popularity in the middle of the pandemic. Now we're down to $13 billion. What's your expectation with this one? I think Instacart's in an interesting position because they don't really need the money right now. They've done a few things that are very, very astute. One, they raised capital in a higher valuation. Secondly, they got their business models such that they became cash flow positive. And number three is they've bought their business models so that they have alternative sources for it. So they have an advertising model, which is doing extremely well. All that adds up to, they don't need to do a offering right now. The reason for doing an offering is just to get some liquidity to a 10-year-old company for some of their employees. But I don't think they need to force to do it. I think there's another dynamic that's out there, Emily. This is interesting. And this is this legislation that's floating around Washington right now, which is the reclassification of gig workers. That's something that would have a material impact on the cost structure for these shoppers going from being independent contractors to being treated as employees. That I think the company is certainly offered. It's a very well-matched company. Fiji does a great, is doing a great job. It's a proven, this is a company that went from 200,000 shoppers to 500,000 shoppers during the height of their pandemic to a well-managed business. But all that's being said is that there's no need right now for them to have to do an IPO in a very, very, or spitious market. So are you saying that you think if they have to classify these workers as employees, it's not going to dramatically negatively impact the company that they're prepared for it? What I'm saying is that I think that they would be able to handle it because it's going to certainly impact the valuation models that institutions are looking at for sure. And I think that, in and of itself, there's a reason you hold off on rushing into an IPO market when you don't need to do it. This is a consumer-facing business. The aura of an IPO is important. There's no reason to rush into a market. When you're in an environment like we're in right now, where there's so much red on the screens of institutional investors from past IPOs, you really need to, you know, to pull off a transaction successfully, what you really need to do is you have to have everything aligned. So you don't need this other variable right now out there which is impacting the cost structure. So I guess what I'm saying is they don't need to do it right now. I think they'll all...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4348,2022-10-18 21:18:50
16003," need to do is you have to have everything aligned. So you don't need this other variable right now out there which is impacting the cost structure. So I guess what I'm saying is they don't need to do it right now. I think they're up for the task if that's where the legislation happens. But that's far from a beta company right now. Well, just talked to Crystal about the era of the unprofitable IPO, which was hugely popular, especially among technology companies, Instacart saying it's turned a corner on profitability. So I imagine that might be one less thing for investors to worry about. You know, is the is the era for unprofitable IPO? Is that over? I think I wouldn't say it's I you never say never. So I wouldn't say it's over forever. But I definitely say it's over for the short term. I'd say that, you know, the there's there's a focus and we're seeing this in our business across the board. We do a lot of M and H transactions. We're doing a lot of capital raising. We just raised $500 million for business. There's a there's a big focus on more mature models that have provided a pathway to profitability or demonstrating that they're that their models are evolved. The days of companies going out with a, you know, someone someone of a pipe tree into the public markets, which frankly, they shouldn't have been in the public markets to begin with. I think that at least for the near term, we're not going to see that for a while. So how are you changing your strategy? And what are you telling your clients amidst these evolving conditions? Well, I think what we're telling people is one, the M and A market continues to be open, particularly from very, very good areas, things like cybersecurity, ESG. We do a lot of work with digital analytic businesses and digital transformation companies. These are companies that have core organic growth within their within their addressable markets which are going to continue. What we are telling people is that for those who are considering the IPO market right now in this environment, that is not something that we would strongly recommend for sure. It's definitely not something that needs to be done. I think that there are, you know, in between all this negative discussion is that still this year, we're going to have a record amount of capital coming in to venture funds. It's just going to be more concentrated. And I just think it's just a general flight to following. So that's what we're advising people that don't rush your head to do something unnecessarily, but there's certainly a market and there's certainly transactions to be done. The transactions to be done are very, very fair valuations for companies that have more mature business models and have the economics to support them. How long do you think the downturn will last? We're hearing, you know, six months for the IPO window to reopen. I'm hearing from some other more skeptical folks, two to three years before we're out of this. Yeah, it's a great question. You look, when you look at what has happened over a period of time, right now, the all these valuation models that institutional buyers look at are predicated on an interest rate. When you don't know what that interest rate is going to be, it's very, very hard to build the models accordingly. So, you know, it becomes very, very challenging when you have a Fed that is focused on breaking the back of inflation. And that's certainly the right thing for them to be doing, but it's hard to do that either. I think that once you get to a stable period of time in interest rate raises, and you start to see that we're entering into, and you start seeing the labor statistics supporting that, I think you're going to see a market that's going to be more receptive. And when markets start opening to the IPO market, the companies that go out in those environments have to be pre-eminent. They have to be the best companies in their environment. And that's really what's traditionally happens in any sort of bad IPO market. The market comes back because the best of the best go out there, they work. The institution start feeling a little bit more comfortable. And then you start, get seeing additional companies come out. I would say, to answer your question, I'm thinking mid-time next year. I would say, Q4, no, Q1 still feels a little early. I would say maybe Q2, Q3, you start seeing it. And again, the equity capital markets are an environment that's a fund runner. So we're going to be honest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4349,2022-10-18 21:22:58
16004," It feels a little early, I would say maybe Q2, Q3s, start seeing it. And again, the equity capital markets are an environment that's fun-runner. So we're going to be out of the form of the economy. You are on the more optimistic side than Adam Burbam, G.P. Bullhound. Thank you. Good to hear your perspective. Right? Coming up, Apple drops after a report about iPhone production plus the company unveils new iPads. For the first time in five years, we're going to talk about how the pandemic has changed the company's approach to tablets. This is Bloomberg. Apple just launched its first fully redesigned entry-level iPad in five years, but shares dropped on a report. The company will cut production of the iPhone 14 plus. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Mark German. Is your assessment about these production cuts? I'm not sure what else Apple or investors or analysts should really expect when the phone comes out through weeks later than the other variations. Bits basically last year's phone but a little bit bigger, really no changes. And it's only $8 per month less than the iPhone 14 promath. There's really not a good reason to buy a $900 iPhone 14 plus. And again, on installments, a much better phone than one you're showing on screen right now, it's only $8 per month. So if you're already spending $900 on a phone, chances are you can spend $1,100, especially if you break up that difference over 24 or 30 months. Interesting. You've also got some new reporting on the iPads, new iPads. Tell us how big a change you're seeing here and why the change in strategy from Apple. So two new iPads. One is the new iPad Pro. With the M2 chip, the second is a new entry-level iPad. I'll start with the iPad Pro that'll be a lot quicker. Smallest update in the history of the iPad Pro, the first one came out. Seven years ago in 2015, they've essentially added just that faster processor. It's about 15% faster. I don't think you're going to see major day-to-day gains from last year's model. There is a new Apple pencil hover feature you're showing, which now if you take the stylus over the screen, it can sense 12 millimeters away that you're there. You don't have to see the rest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4350,2022-10-18 21:27:19
16005," from last year's model. There is a new Apple pencil hover feature you're showing, which now if you take the stylus over the screen, it can sense 12 millimeters away that you're there, so you don't actually have to touch the screen. It's kind of a cool but more of a software-based tweak. Now the entry level iPad, I have no idea what anyone would buy the iPad air. The iPad air with the M1 chip, $600. This iPad entry level has the A14 chip, so a little bit slower, but for over $100 less expensive, so I think it's going to be an incredibly hot seller. I think it's going to do well. The question is, what is Apple thinking right now with its iPad strategy? It's really all over the place. You have five or six distinct models, you have a lot of overlap in both pricing and functionality and capacities and design and colors. The software story is not in good shape. People have been asking for major multitasking improvements for years now. I don't think stage manager, which they're launching with iPad OS 16 and these new iPads next week, is the answer. I think they will do well the holiday season, particularly with the new colorful entry level iPad, but I think they need to give the iPad Pro some serious juice both in terms of hardware and software and really define what the vision in the future of the iPad is. I think it's going to be bigger screens and Mac like multitasking, but we'll see what they have up their sleeves in 23 and 24. Mark, you never sugarcoat anything. That's why we love you. Thank you for giving us, giving it to a straight Bloomberg's Mark German as always. Coming up from the great resignation to the great breakup, why women across corporate America are leaving in droves. That's next.

16006,"..... Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Chang in New York. I want to get to one of our top tech stories today. Twitter shares jumping after a Bloomberg scoop that the company has frozen stock accounts for its employees. It's as the deadline to seal a deal with Elon Musk approaches Bloomberg's as Ludlow helped break that story. So what happened? So this is the equity award center. It's a swap page where employees can go and look at the status of their restricted stock units, the value and also what the trading dates are. The company essentially in the employee FAQs said they've frozen it and the reasoning was that it's pending the acquisition of Elon Musk. It's basically a status update. It's part of them saying that there are shareholders of Twitter stock as a public company. Some of them are employees and for the time being you cannot look out or trade those shares. I think it's important to note that we're in a quiet period window anyway where staff are prohibited from trading. But the timings kind of got the market paying attention to what is largely a procedural development. How does staff feel about this? They're already struggling with a brain drain. We know that sources of told us staff had a number of them with restricted stock units due to vest on November 1st. They were holding off deciding on their own futures. Should they leave the company or not until then? Hey, stock is a big part of compensation. You also saw the market jump on this. Why did the stock jump? I think a big part of it is that it's got a bit quiet in what is an awkward situation where a Delaware judge has said you have until 5pm and October 28th to work this out. So when do it between the two of you? It's a sign, an incremental sign that they're moving towards this deal closing. It's a formality, but it's a positive sign to the market. All right. I expect you to keep us posted. That's right. Thank you. Now I want to turn to what has been dubbed the Great Breaker, which is the phenomenon of women leaders leaving their companies at higher rates than ever before. The gap between women and men leaders quitting. That's the largest it has ever been. This is according to the 2022 Women in the Workplace Study by McKinsey and Leaning.org. I want to talk about why we're seeing all of this with McKinsey Senior Partner Lorraine Ayan, Leaning.org co-founder and CEO Rachel Thomas. I'm always looking forward to this report every year, mostly for a progress update, but this one is not so good. Rachel, explain what you mean by the Great Breakup. It's exactly what you said for the first time that we've been tracking women leaders are highly ambitious. There is ambitious as men, but they're leading their company at the highest rate we've ever seen and at higher rates than men. And we already know women are underrepresented in leadership, so companies cannot afford to lose their precious few women leaders. And to put the scale of this in the perspective for you, Emily, for every woman director who gets promoted, two women directors are choosing to leave their company. That's one up and two out, and that's a problem. Lorraine, you've been working in corporate America for so long. Why is this happening? Well, we see some very persistent headwinds, none of which are going to surprise you. And we see a change in the mindset of women. So some of those headwinds, Emily, we've seen lots of different stabs and cuts every day, but we saw that clearly about 40% of women leaders said that someone took credit for their idea in their meetings this year. We saw that there were two times more likely than men to be mistaken for someone junior, actually kind of undercutting their leadership. And the list goes on. And these are the day-to-day headwinds. They're also...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4352,2022-10-18 21:35:53
16007," for two times more likely than men to be mistaken for someone junior, actually kind of undercutting their leadership. And the list goes on. And these are the day-to-day headwinds. They're also not getting credit for being great people leaders. And so what we see is that when women give more, when they make sure that work works remotely and flexibly, when they actually take care of wellness, when they pay attention to D&I, they rarely receive credit. So those are some of the headwinds which are signals to women. You're not going to advance. And the other thing that I mentioned is women's mindsets are shifting. They're saying, look, I am positive and ambitious. I would like to get promoted. I would like another opportunity. And if that means I need to break up with you and go to another company, go to a competitor, go to a smaller company to get that promotion, to get that raise, I'm willing to bet on myself and do it. And yet far fewer women are being promoted to manager for the eighth year in a row. You're seeing this, Rachel, can you explain this to me? Because I feel like we're getting a lot of conflicting information. I've also heard that more women are being promoted in house or that you are actually seeing that as a potential path to success, perhaps a more accessible path to success than bringing in new women to leadership roles from the outside. Rachel. Emily, you're right. Eighth year in a row that broke in wrong at that first critical step up to manager is still broken. For every 100 women who were promoted to manager last year, I mean, for every 100 men, only 87 women were an 82 women of color. And here's why that matters. At the typical company, when you look at the manager level, 60% of managers are men and 40% of managers are women, which means literally there are fewer women to promote. So that's company's first pipeline problem. And now we're talking about their second pipeline problem, which is on top of that, women leaders are leaving. So our message to organizations this year is we've got a really double triple down on holding on to our women leaders and our up and coming women leaders. The report sides one in four, C-suite leaders is a woman, and only one in 20 is a woman of color. Lorraine, are startups doing at all any better of a job than corporate America at getting these numbers up? I wish we could say yes, Emily, we see pre-consistent lackluster results across any size company in the United States. And so to give you a flavor of this, if you're a black woman, if you're a Latino woman, if you're an Asian woman, as you try and climb up, you just face so many challenges. And one thing that's really important to note is women of color are extremely ambitious. In fact, black and Asian women want to succeed and rise up to leadership roles the most out of all people in your organization. And yet they face these challenges. So just as an example, if you are a black woman, you are more likely, three times more likely. In fact, to be questioned on your credibility. And you know, you received the least amount of support from your manager. And in all of these things add up. And in a world where we have one in 20 women of color at the very top, and given all the emphasis that companies have talked about and are aware in terms of racial reckoning, you would think that we would be making more progress. And the fact of the matter is, is that we're not. Oh, let's talk about the silver linings. You talk about remote work. You mentioned remote work earlier, but given these numbers, Rachel, how is remote work really showing up for women in the workplace? We know before the pandemic, all employees, and particularly women, really valued flexibility. We also know that companies, many of them, are continuing some commitment to at least a level of flexibility. But when you look at remote and hybrid work, what's really interesting is it's not just about flexibility for women. They're actually having a better workplace experience when they're working from home. They're less likely to experience those micro-aggressions we often talk about, getting mistaken for someone or junior, having someone take credit for your ideas. And those obviously have a huge impact on women. So it's just one stat, women with disabilities are half as likely to experience micro-aggressions when they're working at home, at their kitchen table, and then when they're working in...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4353,2022-10-18 21:40:20
16008," At women with disabilities are half as likely to experience microaggressions when they're working at home at their kitchen table then when they're working in the office. So certainly flexibility is not the end all VL answer, but it's important to women because it allows them to fit work into their lives and it's also delivering a better work experience. So let's talk about a plan of action. Lorraine, how can companies and managers and leaders use this information to use this as an opportunity to get better? Exactly. And so what this does is it points a spotlight on what's not working and granted there are a lot of things that are not working but there are solutions out there. When we take a look at better companies companies that are making more progress year over year there are a couple things they do. One, they actually hold themselves and managers accountable. They don't just have dashboards that say that they need to improve but they actually hold leaders accountable for that in their business reviews and their performance evaluations. Another thing that we see is that they empower managers. They give them the tools to do better because certainly the positive intent is there. And the last thing is that we see that they do better in practices. So they really go beyond the basics. It's one thing to have an anti-bias training once a year. It's another thing to say I'm going to have an anti-bias observer and I'm going to really bust that bias in the moments that matter which are performance reviews and evaluations. It's a whole other thing to invest in career development versus just networking on women. Those are just a couple of examples Emily but there are some really concrete things that company can do and I'm extremely optimistic that they can step forward and do these things. So I have to ask you about of course the founder of Lean In who started this movement and that is Cheryl Sandberg who you know now just a few weeks ago left after a very long tenure at Facebook. Rachel what can you tell us about Cheryl's next act and how much more time she's now going to be spending with Lean In and focused on these issues that you know as part of a movement that really she catalyzed. Yes so first of all I love that Cheryl got to appoint in her career where she was ready to lead because we all as women have a right to make choices about her career as you know so well Emily. And as she said publicly she's always been incredibly involved with the foundation and the work we do and fighting to knock down the biases and barriers that get in women's way in the workplace and she's going to continue to do that. And we are thrilled to have more to share with us every day and really speaking up on these issues that are so critically important. So Lorraine a last question there's a lot to be worried about what can we be optimistic about. We should be optimistic about young women so I'm so glad you asked so in the survey this year we found and a lot of people wonder women under 30 Gen X Gen Z what what's their feeling and I have some good news on that. They are so ambitious they want to be senior leaders and that has increased over the last couple of years and they have a very clear view on a workplace that works for them and they're going to step up and live into that. And so when we think about the future of women at work I look at young women and I say look that is our future we have to invest in them develop them and bring them up into the senior ranks. Alright McKinsey's Lorraine a yee leanin dot or it's co founder and CEO Rachel Thomas thank you both and thank you for the work that you do on this report every year we appreciate it. Alright coming up why one crypto venture capitalist is asking the public to public to look at crypto as a technology not a token that's next this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4354,2022-10-18 21:44:54
16009," GEARS Blockchain is a technology which is real deployed in many places. We deploy with Aynx, with some of you were part of, and Link, with some of you were part of, and the JPMORN coin, which is a stable coin back by a US dollar deposit at JPMorgan. And there are a lot of these technologies going to work. They're going to replace ledgers. They're going to make things cheaper. I think banks will be big users of that. And yes, it may disincomiate certain part of banking so be it. That we have that problem, like with technology for the last 50 years. And so my issue has always been with what you guys call a cryptocurrency, which I call a crypto token that doesn't do anything. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dheim and last week doubling down on his disdain for crypto tokens, but backing blockchain technology. Earlier Michael Anderson, co-founder of the crypto venture capital firm Framework Ventures reacted to what Dheiman has had to say on Bloomberg crypto, take a listen. I think, you know, the part about blockchain being real, he's completely right. There are a number of different application categories that are built on blockchain today. Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin just happens to be one of them. NFTs happen to be another. We're starting to see the rapid innovation of what these concepts can bring about, not just from a cost savings perspective for existing businesses, but new types of economic transactions that can exist in a new ecosystem that can connect into the financial aid to a system. And you touched on it in the previous segment, but gaming happens to be one of those segments of the market that's just completely new and a new business model for gaming will bring about a huge amount of economic activity. He makes an interesting point about the coins, Michael, and I've always wondered myself. I mean, even if you see the beauty and the blockchain aside from, you know, faith from the group, what's the reason that these tokens should be worth a lot of money, considering the fact that you don't really need even a full token to get on the blockchain, and they're infinitely divisible. Yeah, well, you know, I think one of the hardest things that we did for ourselves as an industry is called this industry, the cryptocurrency industry, you know, what it should have been, you know, maybe crypto commodities would have been a better moniker for some of these assets, but really it's just a new technology platform. You know, there are reasons why tokens need to exist in these ecosystems to secure networks, you know, one of the ways that the proof of stake ecosystem for Ethereum works is you're taking Ethereum tokens and putting them up as economic security to validate transactions and provide security in that network. You know, there is a core reason for that, and Ethereum in particular has a number of transactions, the amount of transaction revenue that's going through it every single day is tantamount to something that's a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4355,2022-10-18 21:48:50
16010," There is a core reason for that. And Ethereum in particular has a number of transaction, the amount of transaction revenue that's going through it every single day, is tantamount to something that's a massively scalable and profitable company if it were to be traded on the NASDAQ like a Salesforce or a workday. So if we look at them from that perspective, there are assets in this ecosystem that are fundamentally valuable. How, or tell us about some of the businesses you're invested in that are doing actual work with the blockchain, that has nothing to do with the value of the token. For example, smart contracts or recording events. I mean, what can the blockchain do that you're actually seeing it, seeing work in your companies? Yeah, well, one of the companies that we just announced, a large Series A fundraise for, was Stardust. Hannah Miller, hats off to her, broke that story earlier today. They just raised a new round of funding, which we continued on with our existing investment. What they do is they provide an ecosystem for traditional game developers to develop their games and integrate blockchain with the ease of integration of an API and some tooling and some infrastructure. We liken it to being sort of the coin base for Web 3 Daming, where it'll just be the arm ramps for hundreds of developers who are building in this ecosystem who want to integrate NFTs. And frankly, the integration of NFTs just represents a new business model for game developers. It's not a speculative fervor as we've seen with NFC gaming, so far, the tens of developers that are building on top of it are actually building and succeeding today. And we're just going to continue to see that trend continue. Framework Ventures co-founder, Michael Anderson, coming up. What's going on with Facebook? Anyone know? Because Mark Zuckerberg sure isn't talking about it. We're going to talk about why next.

16011," Let's take a look at Facebook now, which some might have think has been abandoned. So to speak, by Mark Zuckerberg in favor of his new child, Meda, that's just one interpretation. Including from our own Max Chaffkin, who wrote this piece for Bloomberg Business Week, focused on what Mark Zuckerberg is talking about now. And it's not Facebook. It's the Metaverse. But is you really ignoring Facebook? I mean, this is a huge platform. And it's not just Facebook, it's Instagram. That's WhatsApp. Okay, so Facebook and WhatsApp and Instagram, this is still the core of Meta's business. And to some extent, they're continuing to make the trains run on time and try to generate revenue and profit. And to be clear, this part of the business generates huge amounts of profit. And if you just looked at that part of the business by itself, you'd say, wow, you know, Mark Zuckerberg is doing a really good job. But then when you sort of look at it in the context of this pivot, which is towards the Metaverse, which happened, you know, a little less than a year ago, company changed its name, of course, away from Facebook to this new thing. And then when you look at just like the comparison of user numbers, right? You know, basically three billion people every single day are coming into Facebook's properties, including Instagram, WhatsApp, and so on. It looks like about 200,000 people are in Horizon Worlds, which is the flagship virtual world that Zuckerberg was touting last week at Connect. And that's the kind of product. That's a product that like, if this happened with some other product that Facebook was offering, they would kill it, you know, instantaneously. This is the kind of thing. Mark Zuckerberg, I don't think, gets up in the morning for, you know, 200,000 uniques. But of course, the company has decided that this is the future and they're pushing towards it. And I would argue pushing towards it, you know, at great risk to the brand and maybe to society in general. Facebook still has a lot of issues. Instagram has issues. We've got an election coming up. If he's not paying so much attention to these platforms, what hope does that give us that these problems are going to be fixed? Right. Well, it's important to say, you know, the company would argue that, yes, of course we're paying attention to these things. It's the core of our business. You know, Nick Clegg has been elevated to this, you know, more important role, you know, overseeing, you know, stuff that includes elections. That said, I think when you go back say two years ago and look at, you know, what the company was talking about, what Mark Zuckerberg was talking about, they were very focused, not just on elections, but on the responsibility that Facebook owes to its users to society. Zuckerberg was talking all the time about, you know, COVID vaccines. And right now we're talking about, you know, getting as many office workers into the metaverse, which, which I don't think has anything to do with those, you know, issues of societal responsibility might in fact work against them. And also, I'm not sure anyone even really wants that. I mean, he's, they're talking about, you know, sending workers to the metaverse at a time when most CEOs are trying to get their CEOs back to the office, back in person. So it feels like they're, they're working against a bunch of trends and maybe even working against their business. So the question is, is this going to work? In hindsight, are we going to, you know, is he going to be able to look, I was right. I mean, is it similar to mobile when Facebook transitioned to mobile and everybody, not everybody, but it seems like a big leap at the time. Is this the same or is this different? It's certainly possible. And if that happens, I think, you know, we will all bow down before, you know, Mark Zuckerberg's prognostication because they'll have done this, you know, amazing pivot two times. Now a couple of things, you know, one is that pivot to mobile, mobile Cheryl Sandberg was, you know, very involved. He had help that maybe he doesn't have today. And just because he executes one pivot correctly, I'm not sure you can sort of say, well, he's going to execute the next pivot correctly. And the sort of leaks and the news that we've seen coming out of Facebook is not super encouraging. I mean, this is, as we learned last week in reports from the Verge and the New York Times, Facebook is having trouble keeping its own employees, you know, interested in its metaverse app, which kind of makes you wonder, how are they going to get other, you know, people who don't actually work for Mark Zuckerberg excited about this? All right. Well, check out Max's latest piece in Bloomberg Business Week. Max Schaffkin. Always good to have you. Good to see you here in person. Thank you.

16013," The Great Sci-fi Art of the mid-20th century teased a vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, put to show reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people out, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy-lisking. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole, another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Von Kerman line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the re-entry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4.com. Free.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4359,2022-10-18 22:06:17
16014," are much greater. By doing that SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now astronauts have had to be physically perfect and this mission is changing that and so I feel incredibly honored to to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H-10 I was diagnosed with bone cancer and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that you know they're capable of doing this as well. Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in 40s and somebody in their 50s and so there can be access in all kinds of way whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time you know people are going up in the space and not sent there by super power like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant and you know you've got to you know be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and you know accessible for everybody so you can have fishing buddies going to space someday but the first is special and so with that we wanted to have you know a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer friendly term. A space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable sort of lighter you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going into space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example the FAA says well we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of. I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4360,2022-10-18 22:10:36
16015," government if you are launching from the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wave. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are so, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom, you see the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well, both you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the way the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and false in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we, before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's kind of all around this and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there for two or three years without coming back to earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news, but at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 to ride into sub-article space when it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rough...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4361,2022-10-18 22:14:56
16016," It may be years, if ever, until Space Tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launched delays and major funders including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards, a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. The vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings traveling to space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and make it all see it for themselves, that will create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast. Or maybe make a pilgrimage to Yosemite. Oh, very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost hound of Bodhi.

And has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. Yeah. But just on a smaller, simple scale. And you drive us around day to day in LA. Yep. And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. This awning. This is phenomenal. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. Let me just pop that out. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special beautiful spots, is that you bustin' out a map and like, looking where it might be cool to go, or is it worth a mouth and just gettin' to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So, a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation room somebody, or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up. It's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So, I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're hooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4363,2022-10-18 22:23:37
16018," It steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette, we made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from yawn and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. It was a beautiful choice. I'd regret having a smoke. Whoa, whoa, okay. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your semity. For the smokey, um, look at it. Strip malls of the central valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across your semity national park. And here to the gorgeous central valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're going to wear here in this near Fresno. This is California farm country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg. So we're right in the central valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20th.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4364,2022-10-18 22:27:52
16019," Yeah, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles. And the farmers here produce about one fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of guys. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinclaw. And he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating. And he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer. And it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business, or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed. And this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, just decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this labor point, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor, I think, eight of these. In order to operate, Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time, while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. So this is kind of like that. This is a test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, so you can see in the background. So every new machine, as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, and it's required to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where are they going? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4365,2022-10-18 22:32:27
16020," 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just, they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard guss, mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. Okay. Vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months she hasn't been alone. L.A.Q. Tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor in what? No. Apparently he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93 year olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. L.A.Q. Who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is L.A.Q. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. It's US offices here in downtown San Francisco. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4366,2022-10-18 22:36:22
16021," The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Like, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q. Is it on sale yet? But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry. Please rephrase your request. She does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories, separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q. From the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. Ellie Q. Yes. Schedule, uh, doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4367,2022-10-18 22:40:54
16022," L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule, uh, doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Ha ha ha. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her foot in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where it'll be like a circle of men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things, that make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine, how are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now the Q, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4368,2022-10-18 22:45:10
16023," By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. Helikue, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that Helikue is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So, don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place.

Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with Baby Shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content, and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat-out strange. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4369,2022-10-18 22:49:22
16024," Change kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows it's Nancy. Here he comes, here he comes, great as tall you ever been and his name is Mr. Machines. Here I go, here I go fighting man for it to go on the land of the C&D air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters as a universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22 minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37 year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore and to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 30 second commercial. Closed it's a mild amount of toolbox. Open it's a micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles. Plains and post to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the real working job. It's highway, passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30 second commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire, movement, Batman! See ya, Batman. Batman's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business. Just grown a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4370,2022-10-18 22:54:04
16025," You think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0 this beginning of sort of like what was the time was commitments you generated content like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos. Lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube was by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which I'm just explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands. Unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this home-new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child to speak unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy. And people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited, seen it piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. He's eating a lobster. And the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were from adults perspective just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. They were just shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they brought these videos and say, we'll look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4371,2022-10-18 22:58:18
16026," Poor play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise! LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is basically the most popular play pattern there is. It was collectible, so within each LOL surprise you get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, in 2016 they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's scene. And I said like what? And they said for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg, children to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. Alright, oh yes, we've got a goal goal. LOL changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over ten billion dollars in retail sales worldwide. LOL is bigger than Star Wars, it's bigger than Marble, it's bigger than Barbie, these brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to figure out when Marble or Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscles and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, except the conflict, we are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4372,2022-10-18 23:02:38
16027," Galodian was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom. Both in LA federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit, Larry and Blaine, the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So, dad by himself forced us to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially. And the rest as they say. So early on MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl Singh. Good morning, Choppel and Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go on to YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million and even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ad spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated. You have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017 big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated the LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, lures the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4373,2022-10-18 23:06:57
16028," And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids' YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars could be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, with voices and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created, basically like a TV show around the toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows create around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform, YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or Not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that, Responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New genres and formats there that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys, in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world, in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4374,2022-10-18 23:11:54
16029," Music Airbnb is huge today. On any given night you could have as many as 2 million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking you know 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong and for Airbnb you know we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape, we're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society, happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially scurrying regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it. An apink night is past August we had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays we're talking you know two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company you know it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging difficult complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities then you also had you know the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image its brand its reputation which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of a hundred highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees at at Airbnb and you know seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds they're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and you know help people who are going through what may be you know the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost they wanted to protect the user in crisis but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand in public image.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4375,2022-10-18 23:15:29
16030," For most, they wanted to protect the user in crisis. But they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of men are civics. Yeah, so I wouldn't be saying about this. They can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into her room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest, the kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys, and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. Both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They wanted to see the policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So if the Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted. And the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4376,2022-10-18 23:20:04
16031," off-membered to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report, it wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. So the Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. So is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. Living away from earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4377,2022-10-18 23:24:19
16032," K from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a space station would be hit quadrace for the final descent to the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Coupula. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about the cysteine chapel, the pyramids, and the Burj Khalifa, or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outposts. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture, and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research. It's educated us about how to live. It's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan, and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter, and in total, they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope, and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-earth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer. And we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4378,2022-10-18 23:28:44
16033," and journey to Mars. Transfrancum world commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one 50th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk, to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that, not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. We won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. That's just one part of the community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4379,2022-10-18 23:33:08
16034," Urging the Lat-Tik and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station. And others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot, which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer, made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4380,2022-10-18 23:37:20
16035," And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, turns the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of Millennial Americans want to buy a home. But this can't afford it. As of 2019, Millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for GenXers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, Millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4381,2022-10-18 23:44:38
16036," And a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older, they're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Uber's and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AME area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Goshen, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like, circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. The houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos. That is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s. And that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media. And they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb in Penteh hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram. And within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying, can I come see it directly with you? And let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quintessential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say, you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. And so, a few years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4382,2022-10-18 23:49:04
16037," 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now, I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media, you post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. That need acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and tick-tock dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. People stay ownership, let's start small, let's don't be scared to start small instead instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer-up or site-on-scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence, they make it look super easy, how we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project, you can do that, you have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say here's a turn key, this can serve our family but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4383,2022-10-18 23:53:11
16038," Here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of a home who are working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience, or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is, do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. And then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged a shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport, but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,4384,2022-10-18 23:57:18
