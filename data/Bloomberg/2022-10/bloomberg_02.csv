So if we're talking about equities just for a moment you got at least two things On. What we're expecting in the higher discount rate affects that. Also, earnings, what are you expecting on earnings? At this stage, we're expecting earnings for 2022 to be $225. I think Stage, you should not expect any growth. Flat in 2023 but every day that goes by with the shocks that we're experiencing higher interest rates the super strong dollar collapses another currencies around the world even oil prices have come down a lot and we're a beginning to see a lot of companies come out and Things are slowing. So, the earnings risk is mounting. What about earnings? So, when we saw FedEx, we saw Apple, we've seen, we a lot of earnings warnings out now. So, we're actually pretty far below consensus. We're at 218 for this year versus 211 last last year and then we're actually at 212 for next year on S and P earnings. So, we think this is gonna be pretty similar to 2015, 20 Where earnings basically go nowhere for a couple of years and I do think companies are much more resilient in terms of managing their business models than they have been in the past. There's a lot more flexibility, a lot more ways to suck out costs, lot more ways to manage through, supply chains are improving, but one thing we've been telling investors is as inflation moderates that takes a bite out of earnings because it takes a Out of revenue. So that's a big headwind we've got next year. So Lori, can companies maybe resilient? What do I consumers? How resilient are they? I'm particularly tie that into unemployment because if we do go this direction, what kind of unemployment are we facing?

So look, we think that the market is set to stage a major battle at 3500 level And the reason for that is if you look back over the course of recessions into the 30s a median recessionary drawdown is about 27% and so we'll get there We're around 3500 on the S and P and I still as I talked to investors I think many are still in the mild kinda quicker shallow camp but do think there's gonna be a sluggish growth backdrop afterwards I think people are not really looking for anything major like what we had in the financial crisis So, I think that at least we've got that at our back.

9511,Become close to or get to know Mike Bloomberg. It's it's actually a funny story So back in 1994 i was sitting in the stands of the world cup semi final game out of the metal lands in New Jersey was Italy versus Bulgaria a friend literally dragged me To the game I didn't wanna go. It's like 100°. We took the bus. It took forever But I walked into the stadium that day and I thought it was the most amazing sporting event I had ever seen. Everyone was painted and Bulgarian and Italian colors You couldn't sit down. So standing there through the match. Thinking to myself You could play this game In New York with any two countries in the world And it would feel exactly the same Then I started thinking about the Olympics which I'd always been a fan of and saying why has the most international city in the world The most international of that And I left the stating that day with this big notion that New York Ottawa host the Olympics and so I built a plan with advisors About how New York could host the Olympics And eventually I showed it to my Bloomberg when he was running the company he wasn't Contemplating running for mayor He gave some money he went on the board And then when he shockingly won To be mayor he asked me to join him in city hall. And what did you do at city hall for Mike Bloomberg and the city? So I was responsible for everything ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,206,2022-10-01 13:17:55

I think people are not really looking for anything major like what we had in the financial crisis. So, I think that at least we've gotten bad at our back. I will tell you, if you About kind of where investors heads are at, something else that makes me feel a little bit better is I'm not sensing a ton of panic, definitely alarm. But the big question of the day is, what do higher rates for longer mean for valuation multiples? And that's a very constructive conversation. And we've done some work suggesting that we're We're getting pretty close if you hit that 3500 The SMP to the same kind of multiple contraction you saw back in the 70s over the course of the entire decade. I wanna come back to earnings but before that, we just heard from Laurie, short and shallow, I think you said, I think she's referring to a recession. Are you projecting recession? And I guess my question really is, normally, if you have a recession, we turn our heads and look at the fed and say, okay, please cut rates. Do we have much To really deal the recession if and when it comes. We're expected a short and shallow recession but we're a bit concerned that the troughs might linger. Well, into 2023. We're not expecting a V shaped recovery after Small recession. I think it's gonna be slow, real growth. Afterward, the trouble here is that the fed can't rescue us because of the inflation problem and they can't attempt to rescue the the equity market or even the economy broadly until they're The inflation battle has been won.

However what's happening in the UK is a shot across our bow one that I hope our policy makers take very seriously and that comes When you're fighting inflation and your economies suffering supply side shocks and other pressures it it is difficult to support the economy it's monetary policy they're hiking rates the BOE and it's difficult to support the Fiscal policy. They also have deficits. So, the United States needs to be a lot more mindful about it. It's deficits whether it's tax cuts or or spending. These deficits need to be watched in this time of rising interest rates. So, Lori, one more attempt to put this in a broader perspective. Yeah. Great financial crisis We're all afraid of. Right. We're in better shape going into this. Whatever this is, then we were that time, right? I think we are. I mean, we we again, go back to our bank sanitist who spend times scrutinizing the balance sheets of the big major banks and we think Mean it is in much much better shape I mean the way I put it is the stress tests do appear to have worked that's one of the reasons why banks haven't really been able to grow in recent years but it is also one thing that I think is going to really be an asset to the financial Markets in coming years.

We can find about a dozen. And the big calf space. So, I think there are things to do but I do think you have to have a strong stomach and I I am mindful of the fact that when these bottoms happen, they tend to be very quick. No one ever pegs the bottom. So, I think kind of moving in slowly and buying things that make sense longer term is what I'd be doing Are supposed to have it in cash. One last one, David, what are all liquidity? Do you wanna be liquid right now? Do you want it? Whatever investment you make, whatever it is, make sure you can get out of it pretty quickly.

Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need. We wanna do 100% clean energy. All electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle All electric with no fossil fuels we wanna do that with our buildings and if we can do it in one building we can do it in all buildings and if we do it all buildings we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,253,2022-10-01 16:43:25

And so the light has been stretching. And so for the most distant galaxies we're looking back back in time almost to the big bank. The hobble was not sensitive to that light. So that the web can see the formation of the first galaxy. It's essentially looking all the way back to very close to the beginning of time. And that's very important because we're not entirely sure Have this first Galaxy's form. The idea of what you just talked about over in terms of how much time this has taken and what it's covering?

We can find about a dozen And the big cap space. So I think there are things to do but I do think you have to have a strong stomach and I I am mindful of the fact that when these bottoms happen they tend to be very quick. No one ever pegs the bottom. So I think kind of moving in slowly and buying things that make sense longer term is what I'd be doing here as opposed to hiding in cash.
