Thanks Anna I'm joined in Birmingham by Mark Littlewood the director general of the Institute for Economic Affairs Mark thank you so much for joining me Busy morning I'm sure the government has just confirmed that it's going to you turn on this policy to scrap the top rate of income tax It's the first big U turn of Liz Truss' premiership. It's boosted the pound. Is it the right Politically I can totally understand why they've done this Lizzy. In fact just yesterday a senior Tory MP came up to me and he said Mark I understand your job. Your job is to be an economics purest but Pretty much within the overall package but I think a lot of people thought it sent the wrong message now I don't need to worry about getting elected I rather think tank but the chance for the prime minister of clearly decided they were Too much political capital on this. They're gonna hope they can kill it, move on, and focus on the rest of the package. So, that's a political judgement. So, Mark, can you see they've had it off the political concern, economically, though, it's alright, but economically markets are still gonna be concern Necessitate is borrowing for growth on this scale really the free market economics that you advoc No absolutely not I mean the I think actually the real reason the market's got spooked was not because of this particular tax rate some people said that was the last straw that broke the camels back I didn't Leave that. The problem the government's got to front up is how are they going to display spending constraint? And of course, at the time of the mini budget, they didn't actually get an OBR report, the office for budget ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,232,2022-10-03 06:55:30

She's given more speeches that you all think Tanka. I think over the past Would she have an acted these policies regardless of the economic contacts the inflation crisis for example is that perhaps what's really gone wrong here? Went wrong here was that she wanted to send a message that that the government was gonna cut taxes across the board and in her words were not that worried about the distributional effects as long as you cut taxes across the board you didn't have to ensure that the poorest two decile cohorts made more cash than the richest She was determined to get away from that and almost abolishing this top rate of tax which is an obscurity really in the British tax system I mean to have a marginal right move from 40% to then 45% is More about performative politics than economics and I think they wanted to signal. We're gonna simplify the tax system. We're going to make it easier to And we're going to encourage higher owners to earn more perhaps paying money and get more revenue by polishing this rate. That was very much a kind of loose trust. Ideological sort of position if you like. That was your first move we don't look so this is all about how it looks really rather than the economics of it politics has Economics in my view as part of this U two. Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute for Economic Affairs. Thank you so much for joining me. It's gonna be a busy day.

Well, it it does mean that when it comes to physical policy needs to be quite a lot more thoughts through, quite a lot more targeted as well as quite a lot more coordinated with the monetary side of things. So Taken the UK as a case in point we had the the government pressing on the accelerator and the bank of England in order to bring down inflation we'll have to engineer a recession to do that so they are pressing on the brakes that's not coordinated policy right so as a result of Fiscal announcement were not expecting higher growth forecast but we're expecting higher rate hike expectations so you can see how when policies are not coordinated and well thought through.

As far as Opec Plus is is is concerned. It seems that on Friday night they decided to push ahead with an in-person meeting on Wednesday. We didn't think we'd see a gathering in person until at least The end of the year that we think that the group is planning quite a big cut in output production and for that to happen it's gonna be easier if the oil ministers or as many of them as possible are in the room together rather than just meeting via video conference and The other thing is we think we could be in for a long meeting because of the complications about Cutting production.

Are they being realistic about the hit to growth from this energy I think this is very uncertain environments. They're trying to think in terms of scenarios.

The other warriors we've seen this build up of disin Scenario momentum in the US underlying there's a wave of disinflation coming eh but a lot of it has drawn on the fact that energy prices have come down if energy prices reverse Of that effect will be delayed and therefore this this the financial tightening will go on for longer than we're currently pricing or even the market's pricing.

Yeah the the way you look at it is we had this big search in demand particularly from the US a big search big issue in terms of supply chain some of it is because of a low Investments for a long time as was a COVID-19 and that's created enormous search and inflation everybody gets excited because it becomes a contensive trade in people very fearful Of it because it's just spectacularly unhealthful. The question happens when demand slows down inflation is very high. One of the reasons is so high is because of markups are insanely high everywhere. People have been doubling prices for any goods like Coca-Cola goodas or Can or something of that nature and it stays too expensive and as demand cools off eventually these markups fall very brulee and another issue is that some of these goods have been overpriced so much that there's actually no demand for it because Oriented towards weaker households.

So now I think it's a general kind of decline in Bonios that we see across across the curve and have to say that we need to see a steep real curve to get more optimistic about the markets in general Look at the 10 year the peak in that Is that dependent on what this fed does or does not do or is this just a world where you think this bond market particularly the long bond starts behaving like a long bond typically does going into a recession ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,325,2022-10-03 13:41:48

I think there are a lot of ministers are keen to do that to reconnect with their colleagues to sit down and have one to one bilaterals. They haven't done this for more than 2 years.

Number fever caught fire in the Philippine Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi Was squirreling away all of the bottle caps and bags you would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps It was a national phenomenon. Perhaps he posted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number five are boosted Pepsi sales every month from 10 1 million dollars to 14 1 million dollars. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria There was even some murders over overwinning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets Over these caps. There was signs that they were going to be problems with number fever very early Pepsihan rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled facts had caused some kind of problem with the winning number They'd announce the wrong one in Chile Riots there were signs that there could be big problems ahead They didn't keep their eye on the ball. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,331,2022-10-03 14:07:42

Next day is always special in Auckland. Everyone is looking forward. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches.

10527,When the next impact is gonna happen and how bad it will be What we know is that an object that's about say a kilometer across is capable causing very very wide devastation across the planet really truly global devastation the object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 km So even bigger than that At a kilometer it's still gonna be very bad and we'll have global effects For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage kind of a large major metropolitan area a city and it's surrounding environments sort of around a hundredish meters it depends on the details of the By the 1980's Nassau was cataloging near earth objects. In 1994 stargazers watched as comet shoe make a levy nine hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the earth. In the event became its turning point in the search for asteroids and comments in our solar system. In 1998 Congress task Nasa with finding 90% of asteroids and comets one km wide or larger. Soon after Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and deep impact brought attention and fear to the masses The great news is that the vast majority more than 90% of all really large one km year of objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are Quite capable causing a lot of damage but they're just harder to spot because they're faintered. They're small. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,337,2022-10-03 14:33:47
10528,"But it does it only means that they look very similar to once We we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? That we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went in the graduative and foreign time they came Quite close to earth. Which we're not detected before or not considered being dangerous before her meeting they are potentially dangerous it's very hard to see Kinda going forward in time and ask for it that's gonna hit her What the earth is really small. And what space is really big and then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from her surface Integrating backwards and time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then, like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what Nasa is doing, Nasa's taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbi And then see what frection sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And then they call it the potential infector. So you calculate a shoulder system forward in time for let's say a 1000 years And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface you calculate them backwards due today And then you get your orbital parameters Of today's astro to which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known infectors. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,338,2022-10-03 14:38:01
10529,"Now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that survey the heavens. But that may not be enough Nasa wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our networking sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our our network of international observers so that we can get follow up Cuz we find these objects when they're distributed all over the night sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data. We can make better prediction If you look at the big impacts we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years Of them. We haven't seen coming. So, the danger, the real danger I think comes from your church. We don't know about and not from your place, we do know about it. This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters in my climate change is a problem with the global comments. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it's sort of then becomes nobody's problem Nobody takes ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with the seconds notice. In the future.

Sally is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it the investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference What are short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are and that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as invest Think it is. If the stock price rises the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back and the more it rises the more costs and that's what's called the short squeeze and the hedge fund melving capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze Lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of his stock The disruption comes in.

So, in our area, we have a small imprint of Comcast but they're not gonna go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to weigh five or cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground and for internet service providers, they're Primarily focused on maximizing their profits and so if you were customers you have you know in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint AT and T released a statement on the matter expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds.

10541," The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that calls water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why cooling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,61,2022-10-03 15:30:13
10542," Well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long-term range. So, ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore, unfortunately, this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today.

As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money and then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people and at the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything so I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and that video got 6 views and then 2 days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about, it really just started building on top of itself and then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks so I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark and then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me so I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like, not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about, it holds a special place to them and third is it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on in order to enter into the marketplace. You either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately, you get the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter. If there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue, like great example, COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,63,2022-10-03 15:39:03
10546,"And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason I love you, your favorite YouTubers, and also TV shows, don't post new videos, in that time of year, cuz at rates are down, why are they gonna make content that? Instead, You're recording in your bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is Crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So, whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get Or on any video you can hit the joint button and that helps support the channel And then the third aspect to that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views. That you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and An automod bands you. To go through that because until you go through that You discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about Oh sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now How do I grow an audience ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,353,2022-10-03 15:43:05
10547," and views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos, and certainly times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to $14. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they gonna make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option, but then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video, you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bans you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have the right to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword and every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back.

One of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Theia and by the products they recommend.

You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing. In China, it started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce.

10551," In the West, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search-of-information, you have recommendation system, and you have a huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influences actually sell good. Here is a perfect choice, nice, neutral, beautiful print, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is I think. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction, whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates the things and say, call this number or something. But live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very, very big difference. It causes different psychology. And live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually, this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner. And you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba? Added a live streaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Over $70 billion worth of goods was sold by a live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys showed that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least ones by live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. When millions of people were in lockdown, and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown, thought there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people dispense that are actually interacting with you. And the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in their sense of like losing control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers, which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming, Villa, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on Taobao platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipsticks, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king was Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like Villa and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany steal and a good income through sales commissions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,66,2022-10-03 15:51:57

It can extend down several 100 metres. I want you to get to the near shore. About 50 m the whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our lands on fossil fuels some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. Hey Of the coast of the united states alone could generate over two 1 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year.

10554," into virtual shopping for good. I'm going to start the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with a live streaming. I'm going to start the store to see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. You could imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore. From about 50 meters the whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady at pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough. So this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Isla Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, Rano, Koivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,68,2022-10-03 16:01:19

10556," The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koei-Vasari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline so the wind blows on the on the surface of the water causing the water particles to rotate and that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long and as they come into the near shore this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research prototyping and testing the company is deployed wave roller a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave roller has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic vacuuming elevators and hydraulic motors and also a generator. The wave roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller. Aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder in a braver man developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded causing the largest in history nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth resuscitation which saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up in a wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized there were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy although it's an immense source of electricity the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success and there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011 the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWavePower. Instead of installing devices offshore the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,69,2022-10-03 16:04:47

Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers under water mooring or cables when Stalin-existent man-made structures and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power Conversion Unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100kW grade-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inu and her team are working on another 100kW project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable brake waters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations, like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas-decommissioning rigs or for powering and the water-autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,70,2022-10-03 16:09:11

I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale of Nissan. I'm making you a real man. I mean, you're a bit small. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared my life. You scared my children. I love these things. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council. The highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gell. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carliscom. And he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Passe. I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gell saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gell was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gell. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. And as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gell was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gell came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,71,2022-10-03 16:13:37
10562," 2018 he was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting and he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gown about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors office and that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto. So after Carlos Gown was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Passe was tasked with investigating Carlos Gown and he was told get to the heart of the matter, find out what Carlos Gown did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gown's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian, and he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very close to Carlos Gown and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gown as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan. He made a decision to go against Carlos Gown and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gown had to go. Harinata was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinata had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing, it just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinata had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gown. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,72,2022-10-03 16:17:41

Hurry Nada is one of the most fascinating figures Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. And he had a meteoric rise through the company Became very very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat and all the major strategic deliberations at the at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Rano and Nissan he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone and he became one of the key figures that decided At Carlos Cohen had to go. Harry Nardo was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So, I have a long standing Relationship with him or did have a long standing relationship with him. For for many many years he was a mentor. I don't support the credibility of the of the process right at the start. Hurry in order how to plea deal With the Tokyo prosecutors. That suggests ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,361,2022-10-03 16:19:08
10564," That could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts, because at that point we reported into him. At the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested, a representative director has been arrested, they both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He sends a letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail backed up by evidence, backed up by memos, of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happens then, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out, and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,73,2022-10-03 16:22:03

I was very concerned as to what they were doing. And who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information The authorities you do think why What's going on there? I mean this is just not normal. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people? Nissan had hired A legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the district court in Oklahoma to basically do AA search and and of of his home and seizure of his you know corporate laptop And other and other documents. If you don't let us in now, So it's a pretty extreme Treat someone who spent 16 years at the company These people have all come in we don't really know who they are apart from the fact that Shown a badge that says the Oklahoma Court And they're here to to recover a laptop ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,363,2022-10-03 16:27:50
10567," I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this is a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nott is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. If a confidential company email, right, you should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company, so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean, people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. You've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age, with your own grandchild. Yeah. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking.

10570," It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day it's seem to sort of rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the shot and steam family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Shot and Steen. In this case that she had against JP Morgan. And it was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So I started just, you know, assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. That included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the shot and steam kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences. It was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements and she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. It was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. And I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan letterhead. And just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. And it's a diary and she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018, the package had arrived, a FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. And so Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,76,2022-10-03 16:36:37
10571," And some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account. She had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place. The granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Don is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating them. And he's furious. Takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an X-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authority. He's usually known as Finra. He took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. You know, the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect. Sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan. They were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that, they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his son's worn criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,77,2022-10-03 16:40:45

10574," Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter, said his sons were criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry, and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own personal tales of financial advisors gone bad, or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really important to me to say that I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person. I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person. I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person. I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person, but I'm not a bad person. I've worked on jewelry, and abused those within. It seems that it's really resonating with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to ri't an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. But at the end of the day, they did wrong. them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus forty dollars. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero but the oil price went to minus thirty-eight. It went far lower than anyone had expected and so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts of play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to sort of push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,78,2022-10-03 16:44:42

10576," Grawling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working-class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle-roads suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. A lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions, pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and they're, you know, drinking buddies sun or their own kids friends from football. They're young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent. Let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to get into it. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a guy which he's starting accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and has done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, doesn't it? But you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Fade and voice is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to tube right away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glencores, but it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,79,2022-10-03 16:48:21
10577,Yeah let I'll let Liam do with Essex I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to you know to cancel this. Sweet as they say. If you want to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine AA kind of essence person. They would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with AA cockney ac Guy Richie Star Accent.

But you know these guys they drove around Places like Mar Bay Area on holiday Fading boys is very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live. And it's 20 minutes to cheap ride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history you know anyone that covers markets cuz it's gonna be surprised about that you know you're thinking BPs of the world. Your Glen course but is this tiny firm? And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious at first we had absolutely no idea If you go to the vega capital website it's so just under construction if you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,368,2022-10-03 16:49:35
10578," This was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. They are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very big deal. It was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks. And you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't. And they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making a one hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero sum game. Any time you're making money as an oil trader someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada. They sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37. Men if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega capital traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable they would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made in the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set. They were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market which is an incredible thing to think about when you consider that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,80,2022-10-03 16:52:36
10579,Briefly hit minus $37 a barrel for one group of traders From a small office. It was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this this had never happened before in the history of all trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter trade and you get paid on both side. You get paid both to sell One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and it it you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a All trade is doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when they're kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made 660 1 million dollars or thereabouts between them I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made inaccessive 100 1 million each Wanna be astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than 100 1 million dollars in a single day were in their 20s one of them was 22 years old you know only a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is Years later making a 100 1 million dollars in a single days trading. When me and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,369,2022-10-03 16:54:14
10580," In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, oil majors, BP and Shell, and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made $7 million or $10 million, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to $700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day, and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately, and they basically all made up their own minds that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion, and some people will look at what happened and think, that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. It's shocking, but lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world, and when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys, you know, potential punishments. If there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it, it might be, you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And you know, in most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlements and misconduct related to trade at settlement. There are other outcomes too, you know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,81,2022-10-03 16:56:53

10582," The reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties so to speak of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases. When you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions. Then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. The business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We could achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out. But others would say and those at the nature conservancy would say these companies have deep...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,82,2022-10-03 17:01:12

10584," to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out but others would say and those at the Nature Conservancy would say these companies have deep pockets they can help fund important preservation work and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years and yeah definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here are 20 NERI's and this is the Disney World this year! If you look at for instance Disney that's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel they have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity so these companies are trying to make major major reductions in their carbon footprints but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges and that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly this land, 3,000 of these acres was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened there was a pending logging contract on this land so they do what they they have done so well for all of these years which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website they when they were proudly announcing this deal they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project and if you look through it this land is a key part of that carbon project and what they're now saying is this land is now once again eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy they do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However in this situation it just appears their their drive which they've had for decades to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say look our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that look we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange it's called the American Carbon...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,83,2022-10-03 17:05:29

10586," and registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects. But they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policymakers. But the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing. Or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them. Because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic. Change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change, it's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. What's happening right now? Can one of you be safe with your company? But that's all we have to do. Unfortunately, I had a question that I wanted to emit, because my recently updated crashes and drive masks, that might be appropriate to settle by the road. What if it's not? And then we have to move it into a safe place. Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes.

10588," The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from L.A. to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was so real to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Instead, electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about 500 tests that we've done in that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sarulucian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces, and there we are, and just like normal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,85,2022-10-03 17:14:21

10590," Right, what her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a hybrid. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces and there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah, we got to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline jumpies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubs will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who were like the Vanderbiltz of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, that the fortitude to stick it out, to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisioning the ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev, and 1,000 kmh hyperloop.

10592," It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hypolute range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester leads. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds. While the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Hard Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. The track is diverged from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections and in that sense you can create a complete Hyperloop network that in the end will make it possible to travel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,87,2022-10-03 17:22:54

10594," Two that makes it possible to eventually split up the I-PLU track in two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete I-PLU network, but in the end we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a high pool because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, heart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have, and we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems, already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects, we're talking about integration into the environment, we're talking about the social aspects, do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects, and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant, and that they need to contribute to bring this to market, to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important, because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam.

10596," get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hart's next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperloop. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea.

10598,"Ú This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it. Yeah. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossard coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility companies Svam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,90,2022-10-03 17:35:57

10600," H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels, but that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries in heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments, and his exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Francing Lockwa caught up with Twiggy Forest. I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. Transition line is complete rubbish. The lie got put to it. Two days ago when JCB really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Fortescue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything super well from Fortescue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at $79 billion USD on Greenwood, per atom. That's a real wake up call to say hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. Every other form of fossil fuel hydrogen, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know is it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even phasing out coal if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. We're more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects, ever wish we'd wind them down as quickly as possible. Because they are cooking the planet just like grey and greenhagen is cooking the planet. You know, hydrogen should not make renewable electricity, it's releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. But let one of methane, which is worse, then it is hydrogen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,91,2022-10-03 17:40:09

And you know anyone else who produces any other rubbers any other I could just look in there and say Why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? Yeah but there's a lot of green washing because I keep on being told it's a transition we can't just you know make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? The personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that.

10602," I think to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green motion. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on green hydrogen. That actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If they had known that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra seriously, that green hydrogen is never here to stay. It's broken through. History has been made. It will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidizing, you stop using money into possibly. Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting asht, while we asked the planet on fossil fuel subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down. It's also some excuses. It's never been commercial, it never be supplied to the quantities we needed. Blah blah blah. Now we know, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. OK, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition? Just going from 8 to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. 8 to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. OK, it's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now is. OK, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now is cheaper. And it's getting more check. But it's the only fuel you know. Mr. Forson. It's declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. I, yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Yeah. Now, we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now. OK, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here at the state that spread it everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years.

10604," treeقتles from Bloomberg's World had quarters in New York. I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Sam, that vision of the future could be your reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Sam Senarios team was studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Sam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Our Maria today spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Cossar coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down. Where do you see prices moving? There's a lot of the reticence of times that has to do with the pricing. That some margual is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000,000, $1,600. Today, $100.00. And we see it going down to $50,000 and $5,000 time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is the future. We want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the States of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25.00 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,93,2022-10-03 17:49:13

10606," Keen, so the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 kilo, which is $25.00 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships and pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years. And then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50% renewable. Where is the price? Buy it? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam, they're speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn out to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and its under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050.

10608," Proud with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. Vice is Bloomberg Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source and in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen, but even in places with less good resources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,95,2022-10-03 17:57:34

So where are ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,384,2022-10-03 17:58:45
10610," that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electrons struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside, though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon captioned storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap.

10614," eight worst months for breath by that measure since 1990. These types of breath washouts, like what we had in September generally only come at the worst of the worst of the bear market. So, you know, you go back to things like the end of 2020s sort of sell off the end of 2018 sell off for the only months that look anything like September in the last five years. Is it a sign of capitulation? It is. It's at least a sign of capitulation. At the same time, the economic data is continually weakening enough to let investors hope that the Fed will turn. And this is the more dangerous component of it. It's how much of this rally is just a bounce off of extreme sentiment, extreme sentiment washout, which usually is one condition for a bottom-forming inequities. And how much of it is based on hope that the Fed's going to turn because the Fed turn is the other condition that is yet to be met. Which means we have a lot of question as to whether or not that's going to happen. It should turn to. It took the word out of our mouth. That's your mouth. That's your mouth. That's a GUI. That's a GUI, exactly. The Fed is going to turn. The question is when is the Fed going to turn? Is it going to be in the next couple of months or in the next couple of years? And that's the question for Wall Street that nobody really has an answer to. I think part of the problem is definitional. What is a turn? Does the market consider a 50 basis point move instead of a 75 basis point move a turn? Or do they actually have to have the Fed say we're going to cut rates? Because they're not going to say that for quite some time. They're not going to have the evidence that inflation is going down fast enough. They've basically said we will put up with a bit of recession and we aren't going to have a lot of details on recession for some time. So at this point you've got to, if I were smart enough to be an equity trader, I would be not counting on the Fed getting involved anytime soon. But like we did get a little bit of software economic data this morning that seems to indicate that okay the higher rates are working and we're seeing inflation just back off a little bit, right? Yeah it's going to be very interesting. I worry that this month's September CPI report that we get isn't going to be definitive enough. But there are a lot of categories that in theory should start coming down. They don't come down as quickly as they went up but they should start coming down and give people hope. I mean then you can sort of try to construct a timeline for when you think the Fed would be done. I want to get to Gina in a moment bring your back in because I know I'm starting to think Timmy and I talk a lot about earnings in JP Morgan October 14th but Mike before we do so did Charlie Evans did Lil Brainard are we starting to though to get these cracks kind of in Fed think in that I feel like Evans in that conversation to CNBC last week maybe hinted about the Fed peaking when it comes to rates early next year is that a new door being opened in terms of fencing? This is something they've been saying for quite some time. There's the strategy of taking rates up to a restrictive level and then there's the tactic of what is that level you go to 4.50, 4.75, do you have to go to 5 and that's the difference in thinking among them is where they think they have to go but remember they're changing their views on that as the economy develops as well. I mean they're data dependent something. All right Gina all yours I'm thinking about earnings what do we need to be thinking about? Yeah so there are a couple of themes that are definitely going to be highlights during earnings season. First is expectations are extraordinarily low actually for earnings season and our guidance model says very easy to beat which I think is interesting considering how many companies have come out recently and sort of missed expectations or even FedEx pulled guidance altogether. So certainly expectations are low but our fair value model actually says the market is prepared for earnings to fall somewhere between 5 and 15% over the next 12 months whereas the current rate is still at 8. Yeah so we're still the market is now expecting an earnings decline to emerge over the next 12 months so if companies can do anything but decline then we're going to see earnings season turn out pretty well. The other issue that I think you want to watch for is the combination of inflation and currency and the second quarter earnings season our transcript analysis suggested that we were finally reaching peak inflation commentary because second quarter mentions of inflation were actually less than first quarter mentions of inflation by companies so companies are suggesting the inflationary backdrop is actually",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,98,2022-10-03 18:10:46

10616," inflation commentary because second quarter mentions of inflation were actually less than first quarter mentions of inflation by companies. So companies or succession is suggesting the inflationary backdrop is actually improving and they were as of a quarter ago. Interesting. It could be fixed getting that or not as a huge question. I think it fits to with we were talking a little bit about supply chains. It feels like people are backing off and we're talking to CEOs are saying that's getting a little bit easier. Yep. And what's replacing that as currency, sort of the dollar surge is a huge topic of concern among corporates was in the second quarter. I can't imagine that's going to change in the third quarter. And the interplay between the two is another thing to consider. You know, this dollar surge is actually pretty helpful with containing the inflationary input on corporates, US corporates anyway. Seventy percent of the S&P 500 is actually domestically oriented. They don't sell any product overseas. So they love a strong dollar. But it is becoming difficult for those multinationals. Another assist though, maybe for the Fed perhaps in regards to inflation. We got to run, but I know we got the jobs report come on Fridays, right? Yeah, Friday. Friday. All right, we got to go.

Is he in first lady Jill Biden, our in Puerto Rico to survey hurricane damage? President Biden will announce more than $60 million in funding to strengthen Puerto Rico's resilience to flooding as he visits the island to observe recovery efforts after devastation left by Hurricane Fiona. The funds come from the infrastructure law that Biden signed last year to help bolster levees, reinforce flood walls and establish a flood warning system. Hurricane Fiona caused catastrophic flooding and knocked out much of the power on the island in September. In Washington, I may be more as Bloomberg radio. Five days after Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida, crews still say they're finding victims of that store. The death toll is now up to 68 with all but seven of those in Florida. And the state's emergency management director Kevin Guthrie says crews are working to restore power for those that can receive power. The estimates are that they will have restoration done by Sunday. Guthrie says more than 600,000 Floridaians are still without any electricity. Insurance appraisers say insured losses have risen to as much as 57 billion. President Biden will be traveling to Florida Wednesday. The Supreme Court is back in session and refusing to expand gun rights.

So top of mind, and the most red story on the Bloomberg, it's back credit Swiss Group plunging into fresh market turmoil after the company CEO made some attempts to reassure employees and investors backfired adding to uncertainty surrounding the bank. Tim, it's the second time in as many weeks that the CEO sought to calm employees and the markets with a memo. This one was late Friday stressing the banks liquidity and capital strength, but it's always like when the CEO comes, hey, we're okay. We're okay. Yeah. And I don't know if you spent, I hope you didn't, Carol, spend any time on Twitter over the week. And unfortunately, I did. There was no shortage of takes as to what this could mean in like some comparisons back to 2008, which a lot of people threw water on very quickly. All right. So let's get to it with our Allison Williams. She's Bloomberg Intelligence, Senior Global Banks, analyst. She joins us on the phone from our bureau in Princeton, New Jersey. So Allison, I mean, this is a bank with I feel like a laundry list of things that continue to give it a hard time. So tell us what we need to know front and center here. So the key issue is uncertainty in a tough market. I would say the bank is facing some issues. They said they want to do a strategy. They said they're going to announce it late October. And I think it's just tough while investors are waiting that. Meanwhile, you know, the market presents two challenges. One is that their revenue and profits are tied to the markets, especially businesses such as leverage lending where they have a particular strength and that there's going to be some weakness or that quarter, as well as, you know, some of the other businesses that they're stronger in IPOs and the like. So the revenue and profitability challenge gets tougher with the market, which sort of increases the pressure on them to act. And then the second is that if they need to raise capital and that will depend on, you know, what strategy they move forward with the delutiveness of that capital raise, obviously gets worse as the stock goes lower. And so in a way, it sort of pushes the bank potentially more towards asset sales and asset distributions that would not be relying on the capital raise. I wonder, Alison, what it means for potential clients of the bank? Do they say, do they see what's going on and they say, wait a second, we're going to reconsider our business with Credit Suisse and then it turns into this sort of vicious cycle? I think the one thing that helps Credit Suisse is that the business that's the most sensitive to market sentiment is Prime Brokage and that is a business that they have largely exited. So that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,101,2022-10-03 18:23:39
10621,"Bloomberg business flash. Alright, Charlie. Thank you so much. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on Bloomberg Radio. So, top of mind and most red story on the Bloomberg.

She's Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Global Banks analyst. She joins us on the phone from our bureau in Princeton, New Continue to give it a hard time. So, tell us what we need to know front and center here. So the the key issue is uncertainty and a test market I would say they you know the the bank is facing some issues they said they wanna do a strategy they said they're gonna announce it late October and I think it's just While investors are waiting that. Meanwhile, you know, the market presents two challenges. One is that they're revenue and profits are tied to the markets especially Businesses such as leverage lensing where they have AA particular strength and that there's gonna be some weakness or that order ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,390,2022-10-03 18:25:03
10622," Credit Suisse is that the business that's the most sensitive to market settlement is Prime Brokage and that is a business that they have largely exited. So that business among all the investment banking and banking businesses broadly are most sensitive to, you know, we're worried about this bank and we don't want to trade with this bank and business moves away and that can happen very quickly. You know, we saw that with Joy to Bank some years ago. One of the areas that they've had some trouble in and so they've moved away from that business so that makes them less vulnerable to market sentiment. Obviously, clients do worry across a broad range of issues and that's part of the reason why they've had, you know, at least something you can sort of attribute some of the weakness to over the past year they had the risk issues with archigos and some other things and so that may have led to some client attrition but I think, you know, the bottom line is I think the sooner the better that they come out with their strategy, unfortunately they're trying to, or I guess fortunately you want them to take their time and do it thoughtfully but with the tougher market it's tougher investors to have patience. Allison, is this Deutsche Bank 2.0 or no? There's similarities and there's differences. I think Credit Suisse is fine for the moment in terms of their capital buffer and their liquidity. We know that sometimes those things can change rather quickly but it's in a solid position on that front. They also do have the international wealth businesses and the Asia businesses which are under some cyclical pressure and again some of their other businesses like the Securitized Product Trading Business is a great business over the long term but under cyclical pressure. So I think they do have some good pieces and businesses that do have good returns in a better environment. You know, the similarity is that they're having to go under a restructuring which is never a good thing but in a time when the market's not cooperating with them that's similar to Deutsche Bank in the sense that they were very focused on fixed income trading and at a time when that was very out of favor. That the environment has really turned around for Deutsche Bank and they've also made some tougher decisions. So that's the other similarity is eventually Deutsche had to make tough decisions and so Credit Suisse is likely to face that same challenge. Allison, we'll have a minute left and I just want to end with a very basic question here. How big of a deal is this? Because it seemed like a very big deal that over the weekend and it's now it's not seeming as big of a deal. And just got 30 seconds, yeah. I think to your point, CDS is something that meant something in the prior crisis and in this particular market there are several reasons why the CDS could be reacting. It's not necessarily the same signal it used to be. There could be other factors applied in terms of just people wanting to short any bank. All right, bottom line. I'm going to give you 20 seconds. What's more interesting to you right now? It's going on with Credit Suisse or you're looking ahead to JP Morgan earning. Well, that's an easy one. Credit Suisse, that's an answer that I think we need to get JP Morgan more important for the broader market. But Credit Suisse, I think, more important among the companies. All right, so great to get you to weigh in on all of this. Allison Williams, Senior Global Bank to Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence on the phone from our Bloomberg Bureau in Princeton, New Jersey.

10628," The market is clearly concerned about something. I would say most cell-side analysts in response to the deliveries are sanguine, that this is an issue of logistics like Tesla said. So deliveries came in at 343,830. The street was looking for 358,000 and what Tesla said was there's always a mad scrambled at the end of each quarter to get vehicles to customers. But this time, they have four factories and three continents around the world. And what happened was these are cars that have been ordered, but they're in transit. You can't book a car as being delivered. You can't book it as revenue into it's actually delivered to a customer. So even though 343 was low, below expectations, it seems like there's a lot of cars out there that were making their way from the factories to the customers and those don't count, but they will count next quarter. So shortage of component and is it a global thing? Is it certain facilities? It's not really a shortage of components. It's Tesla's ability to put these EVs on a semi truck and move them from A to B to put them on a boat. You know, we have to remember. How come they can't do it? Well partly, can't they put them on a rocket ship? I mean, this is Elon Musk talking about it. This is what you forget. You know, Tesla's a fantastic company, but if you go on the 101 in California, for example, and drive through the middle of that state, you just count dozens, hundreds of trucks carrying five or six Tesla's on each one. That's still how you deliver a vehicle from the factory to the end customer. It's not an issue of part shortage. It's an issue of expedite costs that because of this mad scramble, Tesla's trying to work out how it can get these vehicles to the customers at the last minute without paying painfully high costs and you know, freight has come down from some of the pandemic error highs, but it's still high. Are we hearing this from Ford from General Motors, from Volkswagen? Well, I mean, in Ford and GM's case, they had a slightly different problem, which is they had tens of thousands of vehicles which were missing components, probably semi-conductors. And so they were parked on a piece of tarmac somewhere waiting for those missing components to come in. I think there's a real key piece of data that I point to. The production number for the quarter actually exceeded expectations for Tesla, but the percentage of those produced cars that were delivered was really low, about 94%. Often, Tesla will deliver more vehicles than it's produced. And you know, I think one read on that data is that this, we do take Tesla at face value. This was their ability to move the vehicles from A to B, not that demand is waned. So help me out. Like, are they reaching out to Tesla customers and saying, listen, we can get this to you, but it's going to cost X. Well, is that a solution to this problem? And I'm wondering like, Tesla, I would think buyers can maybe afford to pay a little bit more. Yes, especially given that the average selling price is high, you know, for any Tesla model. There's definitely some cases on Twitter where people that have ordered Tesla said, oh, actually, Tesla reached out to me and asked if I could take delivery in the first week of October, last week of September. And when I said, no, I'm away on vacation, you know, that's the reality of it. And as I said, just remember, you cannot book or mark a vehicle as delivered until it's actually delivered. And then being in transit's big problem, I go back to a bigger issue, which is four factories, three continents. You know, Tesla is still new to this in the sense that Berlin just came online, Austin just came online. Previously, if you were in the UK, for example, you'd probably received a Tesla that was built in Fremont, California, completely illogical to build it and then ship it. So what they're trying to do is even out that regional production and then move the vehicles from where they're produced in those markets. So give us an update on the factories here. You mentioned Austin, you mentioned Berlin. We have Shanghai as well that is certainly up and running. It's kind of a unique market if we can call China that. A lot of those stayed domestic, right? So a lot of the Chinese production does stay domestic, but there is export to other markets as well. The China production vehicles are kind of higher margin, which is interesting. We find out about that during earnings. Production in Berlin is still relatively modest. You know, it hasn't been online for that long. But it's ramping up at a clinic. And as has always been the logic, why build cars in Berlin? Because then you can deliver them to customers within the European Union. It's just that they're ramping up now. What ends up happening to what what's happening at Austin right now and what ends up happening at the Gigafactory versus what's happening in Fremont? Yeah. So, you know, Austin is principally building model wise, the kind of small-ish SUV type vehicle. And this is a relatively new facility as well. And it's a relatively new facility in Fremont, California. They build multiple lines, the Y, the three, and then these...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,105,2022-10-03 18:41:20

10630," The kind of small-ish SUV type vehicle. And this is a relatively new facility as well. And it's a relatively new facility in Fremont, California. They build multiple lines, the Y, the three, and then these smaller volume productions of X and S. And it's exactly, as I said, Austin, they will if build them and send them around the country here in North America and into other markets. And this is part of the problem, right? Like my dad, for example, has a Model 3. He's very proud that it was built in Fremont, California. If you're a Brit or you're European, you don't want to order a vehicle that's shipped to you from China or from the US. You probably want it built from the European Union. That's the change that Tesla's going through. So I'm just interested in his dad's car. So he had it shipped from California to the UK. Yeah. And he was one of the early adopters in the UK. So if he were to buy that car now, would it have come from Berlin? It very likely would come from Berlin. But while they were bridging that gap, it may well have come from Shanghai, for example. So that's what's interesting. Can't choose where your Model 3 is made up. I don't think you can. No, I think that's... But this is what the little wording that was in the Tesla press release. This is what we're latching on, evening out of global production. Well, so, OK. So from what we got today, what do you focus on? And what should everybody as investors just say? It's not just an evening out of production, but something else. There are cynics on the street. The stock ultimately is down by the most since mid-June. This is a demand issue. But those cynics would also say, well, if these cars were in transit, they'll show up in the December data. The December quarter could be astonishingly good. We also have earnings later this month in October 29th, I believe. I checked the Bloomberg terminal. But Tesla is actually pretty transparent. Over 19th. Yes, you're right, 19th. So Zach Kirk on the CFO often does give granularity about the supply chain issues that they're experiencing. He often does explain the specific bottlenecks. And also, the higher input costs, they talked... Actually, I say they must tweet about it, about them battling these expedite costs. The cost of scrambling at the last week of the quarter. What are those costs? We don't actually know if they were freight in terms of semi-trips, ocean freight. We'd love to hear more about that. Right, some more color on this. And we'd love to hear more about, how does Dad like the Tesla? He loves his Tesla. OK. Is there some conflict of interest here? Are your other EVs available in all markets around the world? OK, there we go. Full disclosure. Full disclosure. All right, Ed Lovelow, thank you so much. Weska is corresponding on the East Coast for us.

You go in that house. You're going to be carried out. I want to be very clear about that. We have Lauren Order. Lee County Sheriff Carmine Marceano. It is the first Monday of October, and that means a new term for the Supreme Court. And it's already out with some big decisions. The justices have left the federal ban on bump stocks intact. Those are the attachments that make semi-automatic rifles fire like machine guns. They rejected two challenges to the ban, including one from the National Rifle Association. The high court also agreed to take up a case that could decide whether social media companies can be sued for content recommendations linked to terrorist attacks. It's a challenge to section 230 protections for social media.

Thank you so much. Carol Maser along with Tim Stenevich live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio streaming on YouTube. In the upcoming issue, Bloomberg Business Week out later this week, a story about the millions in cryptocurrency that vanished as agents watched helplessly. We got Joel Weber with us. He's the editor of Bloomberg Business Week. He's right down the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. You can follow him at Joel Weber Show on Twitter. Also with us is Pat Rignere. He's markets and finance editor for Bloomberg Business Week. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. So Joel, when we talk about crypto, we often think about it being used for, I mean in the early days, right, the early, early, early days. Was that eight Bitcoin or something like that? Yeah. Worth a lot more than pizza now or people or people storing their Bitcoin and forgetting their password. What about watching the Bitcoin just get stolen from you right in front of your very own eye? Yeah, that kind of good segue into this current story by David Voryakis and my colleague, Pat Rignere, who's the finance editor of Business Week. Also, Jonas, to talk about this. So yeah, remotely swiping Bitcoin that's been seized by the government. Do you sort of, that doesn't like totally make sense? You would think that you couldn't do such a thing, but it turns out maybe you could, Pat. So what happened? Yeah. So the first thing I asked David when I read an early draft of the story was, so the feds had basically seized these things that kind of look like a small hard drive or actually they kind of look like an MP3 player and put it in a storage. It's not that simple and the feds knew it isn't that simple. But it's actually on one of these storage devices is really just a series of cryptographic private keys. Bitcoin, of course, crypto, lives on the blockchain. And if you have the rights that of passwords, you can reconstruct all those keys somewhere else. So when the feds basically seized this cache of Bitcoin as evidence in a money laundering case, they knew from the get go that this money was very vulnerable to being taken so they were kind of like watching on the blockchain, what was happening with these wallets and they very quickly saw those coins going away. So what's also interesting here, so this arrest, let's talk about Larry because there are people in the story and in crypto are memorable Larry might be one of them. Something of a milestone. So we can laugh, right? That gets it? No. Just kidding. My dad's name. Except for your dad. But you referred to it by David's word, something of a milestone in crypto enforcement. Why? Well, so the first character in the story, Larry, basically ran a what's called a tumbler or a mixer. So basically this is a thing that you can use to if you want to sort of make your cryptocurrency transaction truly private, right? Because you can always see addresses on the blockchain and if you can kind of stitch together and that information, you can kind of figure out where a bit of Bitcoin came from. There are these services called mixers and tumblers where you sort of like, it's what it sounds like, right? You just sort of mix together a lot of cryptocurrency and then spit them out in different ways so that you can't find it. I'm visualizing Pat like a rock tumbler that you had when you're a kid and I think that's, I don't know, is perhaps that's where the name comes from, right? You put a bunch of rocks in, you let it set for a month and the rocks that come from to come out looking completely different. Yeah, I think that's basically right or you're just sort of, you're stirring everything together so that you can't figure out sort of where they came from. And that's not per se illegal but as with a lot of things in money laundering, you know, running a secret car wash isn't necessarily illegal either but if you're doing it to hide where the money is coming from, then that's what's happening. So the feds went after our first character, Larry, for basically money laundering. And then while he was, I'm sorry, not while he was being held, he was out on bail. Suddenly the money began to disappear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,107,2022-10-03 18:49:58
10633,"I asked David when I read a early draft of the story it was so the feds had basically seized these things that kinda look like a small hard drive or actually they kinda look like an MPthree player and put it in a storage locker and I asked the Dumb question so why didn't they just unplug it You know what's actually on one of these storage devices is really just Of cryptographic private keys Bitcoin of course crypto was on the block chain and if you have the right set of passwords you can reconstruct all those keys somewhere else so when the feds basically seized this cash of bitcoin as evidence and a money They knew from the get go that this money was very vulnerable to being taken so they were kind of like watching on the blockchain what was happening with these wallets and they very quickly saw those cranes going away So what what's what's also interesting here?

10634, uh... i've started not well as being held he was out on bail suddenly the money began to disappear and they started asking okay so who's actually taking the money out of it and um... ultimately uh... they decided they've actually accused not larry but his brother garrie of doing this and so uh... can't make this up right larry and garrie so uh... garrie is still awaiting trial we should say so this is not this is an allegation but they're looking at uh... sort of they've been following the money well speaking of following the money i cannot uh... do an interview with you pat without talking about this picture of gary harman that's featured in i don't know if we can get it up on youtube uh... we don't have it on youtube so you can have to check it out in the magazine but it's gary harman in a tub full of money uh... this is a picture that the u.s. district court for the district of columbia has uh... what's going on here well so that's a picture that uh... prosecutors found on his phone uh... and uh... basically they were collecting evidence that he had come into money so they're sort of looking at that saying it's like it looks like this guy uh... suddenly you know had had a fair had a fair amount of money it's that's nothing he's been he's bathing in cash now it's bathing in fair it does look if you look closely mostly one dollar bills one dollar maybe a couple two dollar bills in there that grandma yeah yeah six hundred bucks at the most year it might it's a little bit less than that but yeah this is what you want to do for your birthday i mean it's something seems like a good idea that's a fair don't take a photo of it so how did this all kind of unfold i mean how it all came to be so uh... you know our reporter david voreak is being he's always sort of like watching court cases and so he's been you know sort of looking at how these cases have been moving through court but what this is this is really a case of like in the early it you know there are people who want to use bitcoin to make transactions that maybe you shouldn't be making now and uh... there's a place called the dark net where people do that sort of a part of the internet that's not easily accessible on google and so first of all you're connecting in buyers and sellers but then the question is so how do the buyers and sellers pay for the things that you're not supposed to be paying for bitcoin is one way but as we've just discussed it's not perfectly anonymous there are services that are actually very good at following the breadcrums so uh... layering her ms innovation was uh... finding a way to uh... obscure those transactions and it was very successful and it got the government's attention and as as you know it's not this is not the only service that's got the government's attention since then right you know there's another one called tornado cash and i think a lot of people who are in this uh... are asking like how how long will these mixers uh... be be around okay so just bring it back to the the the swipe of this uh... so they we've got some interesting people and there's uh... hard drive full of bitcoin bitcoin now worse more than it was then what what did law enforcement observe like how did it what did it look like from a law enforcement perspective so i what is it what does it look like when you're bitcoin or disappear basically yes so they've got they've got the devices in a locker but what they what you really want to watch where the action is is on the blockchain and so you're looking at wallets so they had a list of like sixteen wallets what does it look like i mean you're just looking at an address number a bunch of numbers and then there's just a certain number of bitcoin assigned to it and then they could begin to see like those bitcoin were just going away they're getting transacted away and and we know and uh... so you know should unplug the hard drive yeah should have unplugged hard drive as we said it doesn't really matter whether you unplug that that's what i was wondering if the if you if you do have one of these usb like or old school you know mp3 player type things and that's what you store your bitcoin on does that mean it's not safe like it can still be accessed because it's well what everyone in crypto will tell you is the most important thing is to never give away your seed phrase so uh... seed phrase is a thing that can be used to basically reconstruct the raven lands at midnight so yeah that's not mine so is that what you mean yeah do you it's it's it's something literally like a bunch of random numbers you know or i'm sorry not a bunch of random numbers a string of random words usually twelve sometimes twenty four and i'm not an expert on how the cryptography works but it's cryptographically related to i believe the private keys that you're using and so if you enter that seed phrase and this this this is not just with the hardware while this is a,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,108,2022-10-03 18:54:25

So, you know, our reporter David Voriak has been he's always sort of like watching court cases and so he's been, you know, sort of looking at how these cases have been moving through court but what this is, this is really a case of like in the early, you know, there are people who wanna use Bitcoin to make transactions that maybe you shouldn't be No. And there's a place called the dark net where people do that sort of a part of the internet that's not easily accessible on Google and so first of all you're connecting in buyers and sellers within the question so how did the buyers and sellers pay for the things that you're not supposed to be paying for bitcoin is one way but as we've just discussed it's not Anonymous. There are services that are actually very good at following the breadcrumbs. So, Larry Herman's innovation was finding a way to obscure those transactions and it was very successful and it got the government's attention and as as you know it's not this is not the only service that's gotten the government's attention since then. Right? Exactly. You know there's there's another one called tornado cash and I think a lot of people Are in this. Are asking like how how long will these mixers be be around? Okay. So, just bring it back to the the The swipe Of this. So, they we've got some interesting people There's a hard drive full of bitcoin, bitcoin, now worth more than it was than what what did law enforcement observe?

10636," expert on how the cryptography works, but it's cryptographically related to, I believe, the private keys that you're using. And so if you enter that seed phrase, and this is not just with the hardware while, this is with a software while, that seed phrase is the thing that's, it's the key to everything. Every time I look at crypto, because I work for Bloomberg, I can't really own crypto, but every time I do, I think I would have a nervous breakdown if I ever had to do anything with crypto. The first thing you have to do is you have to, you know, safely store it and you have to then write down your seed phrase. And now you've got two problems. You're either going to lose that seed phrase or somebody will find that seed phrase. That would make me so anxious. That would make me unbelievably anxious and I would like to talk to some point people who have learned Bitcoin investments and ask them how they handle that emotionally, because it's quite a wild thing. I mean, I think people even come up with objects that they engrave seed phrases into and they bury them in secret places and things like that. Wow. But yet, you know, to get out on bail, David Storrie sort of brings us back to July 2021. After his arrest and he's been accused of money laundering, Gary was, he requests bail, right? And then prosecutors said to secure bail, Gary should have to turn over seed phrases to the stolen Bitcoin. And his lawyer said that condition would force him to mint crimes, which violates his fifth amendment, right, against self-incomination, which I thought was a very fitting way to kind of like, you know, wrap this story was with, you know, the government asking for those same seed phrases. That's right. You know, I mean, that's quite a catch 22 to be. And I think probably his lawyer had a point. Hence, why you have counsel. Okay. I have one more question for Pat. I just want to dig in deep on this. So does that mean if you buy Bitcoin or Ether from PayPal or something that's, you're not, you don't really own it because you can use these, you know, traditional, trad-fi services to actually do that? Sure. I mean, there's so many ways to own Bitcoin. I mean, if you talk to like hardcore crypto people, there's a phrase called, not your keys, not your coins, right? Oh, yeah. You know, and there are big believers that you've got to have the keys and you have to have ultimate control. But like, you know, a simpler way to buy Bitcoin is the way that you buy a share of Apple stock, which is like you just go on to some brokerage site that's selling crypto and you, you tell them that you would like to buy some and then they buy them or maybe they're working with a middleman who buys them and they're just remembering that you have it, right? And they're just keeping a ledger. So it's, it's this funny case where, you know, the idea of crypto is there's this big public lecture ledger and you don't use a middleman to go on the ledger. But a lot of people, it's like, well, you just want to be invested in the thing that you think is either going up or going down. And so you do a lot of not very like crypto-ish things to do that and just ask somebody else to hold your crypto for you. Is the government getting better on figuring all this out? They, they seem to be. Okay. I mean, I think, you know, they've, we actually ran a story a few weeks ago about a company called Chain Analysis that is sort of, you know, one of the, one of the companies that the government works with, uh, to figure this out and they trace these breadcrumbs. Uh, deep teas for our crypto show, crypto IRL. It airs now Thursday nights on a Bloomberg quick take and then Fridays on Bloomberg TV. We are going to have a good episode with Chain Analysis coming up in just a few weeks. Great. Well, I hope that wasn't a spoiler. No, it wasn't. It wasn't. Don't worry. We haven't filmed it yet. So we can choose, we can choose if it's a spoiler or not. It's so funny because I thought this was going to be the way for, to kind of evade government oversight. And yet we're finding out. No. I mean, you know, the thing is, is that in the end, it's like there's, uh, what happens on the blockchain, but there's also still what happens in the real world. And like one of these, what this story will tell you is like, you know, they may not be able to keep your crypto in jail, but they can put you in jail. Yeah. That's a really good point. That's the thing to remember. That's the power that the state has. It's a great story and it's going to be in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business week on NewStans later this week already on the Bloomberg terminal and can also find it at at bloomberg.com slash business week. Pat Ragnier, thank you so much.

It's in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business Week Magazine. In the meantime, I do want to get a quick check of the markets because we are seeing a three right now in the S&P 500. More than three tons of 1% to dial up, three tons of 1% the NASDAQ up more than 2.7%. We're going to head over to our TV colleagues. Check about the markets and this rally in just a moment. This is Count Under the Close, just 60 minutes left in your trading session. Caroline Hain remains in Boston. Join us by colleagues. Tim Stenevich. We go cross-platform as we always do. TV radio, YouTube, we shout out Taylor Riggs who is running another marathon successfully. And today, well, she's risk on and her legs. We're risk on in the market. She's 24th. It's the last time we rose this much. Yeah, it's pretty significant and we're continuing to see the equity side of the universe trend even higher. Here we are at our highs of the session. But you know what's not partaking in this kind of enthusiasm in the market is the commodity space. Continuing to be under pressure, I took a look at the Bloomberg commodity spot index. It's down just about 1%. But if you look at things like lumber or copper, container freight, all of this has come down and you're saying, yeah, but I'm saying, yeah, Romaine, because what does this say about the economy more broadly, how much is global recession, how much is a pandemic reset? Yeah, I mean, we saw, I mean, I think we're starting to see a little bit of green on the day. But yeah, definitely the longer term trend, particularly when it comes to a lot of the base metals, I like cop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,110,2022-10-03 19:03:00

10640," that's in how much is a pandemic reset? Yeah, I mean, we saw, I mean, I think we're starting to see a little bit of green on the day, but yeah, definitely the longer term trend, particularly when it comes to a lot of the base metals, like copper, aluminum, things that basically go into manufacturing. Yeah, I mean, Mike McLean over at Bloomberg Intelligence loves to look at copper as an indicator and he sees warning signs there. I was looking for some outperformance though and I see that with KBW bank index. The banks are higher today. Goldman Sachs upgrading Wells Fargo, we're seeing that lead bank stocks higher. On the other end, we did see Citigroup downgraded from buy to neutral, though not weighing too much on the entire index. I mean, it is phenomenal how much we see a correlation in stock stand in bonds today. We see banks go higher even as yields go lower. We're looking overall at the S&P 500 currently up. 3% as I said the best day since June 24th, volumes actually being elevated as well a little bit on the S&P, we're seeing some commitment to this trade. We're up 30% in terms of volumes. Dow is up more than 3% is two seeing volumes on the upside. NASDAQ up 2.66%. So actually a vague lagged and actually volumes on the downside for your big tech. But Russell 2000 small caps up more than 50 points. That's more than 3% on the higher side remain. Well, all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 are in the green energy stocks out in front in a big way up about 6% to the bottom of that list is consumer discretionary, which is only up, well, it's easily 1% here. But you can see once again, this is kind of that everything a rally that we're seeing. When you look at the S&P group, so the 24 groups there is one group out of the 24 that is down. That is the auto and component index. And the big part of the reason is because of the big down draft that we're seeing from Tesla, Tesla shares are down about 7% here on the day here. Having one of their worst days that we've seen going back to the middle of this year, after they had a miss on those deliveries here, it wasn't a huge miss. And we know that in the past, when they've missed in a particular quarter or particular month, they tend to make that back up in the months and quarters ahead. But at least for right now, some folks are a little bit concerned as to what they saw out of those numbers. And they're going to be a little bit more complex on mobile rallying hard on the day, up about 5%. And here's a tale of two companies, Pete Deeteris, who helps run a lot of our markets coverage here, said this to me this morning. He said, between Blue Apron and Peloton, which one of these companies is still going to be in business 10 years from now. Blue Apron right now, down about 42% here on the day. Peloton, meanwhile, up about 6% here on the day. A lot of concerns for both companies about their long-term trajectory. But at least Peloton, they got that big deal with Hilton. They're going to put all these Peloton, and all the hotels. Well, I remember when we were in LA, we were both using the peloton and app for the hotel. Are you serious? Yeah, it's a nice way to get it. And I have to say, I think it is perhaps a gateway into deciding actually peloton something you want to try on along the term. Although I would say the peloton app is very good in your hotel room if you don't want to be getting on a bike. Meanwhile. But then you have to have the bike. Don't you have to have the bike in your room? No, they, you could do pilates. I could do bar if I weren't here. Yeah. Or manner of things you could do. Can you get Blue Apron delivered to your room? That seems to be the picker issue. I think you'd lack a gas ring or something there would be an issue. But let's have a quick look at what's happening in terms of your assets. Because this is another one for Pete Deeteris. Positive stock bond correlation. Look, the problem here is that it stocks the rising. Bonds are also rising. Well, if we start to flip that around again, it might mean that we're back to losing on your 6040. Where's the diversification, Carol? Where is the diversification? What's interesting is we continue to track all of the Fed speak. And Dr. Yardani, Ed Yardani, Renzo's own research firm. Really someone who's watched so many different market cycles. And of course, coined the bond vigilante term about when the bond market really is opposed and protesting what's going on in terms of monetary policy. Well, he reined in a little bit earlier about watching financial market conditions. He's definitely concerned. And he pointed out to the Fed, vice chairman, Lil Brandard, also talking about her concerns. The idea of the operas came to me on Friday when Fed Chair, Lil Brenner, gave a speech in which she basically indicated the Fed is between a rock and a hard place. I think it's actually between Volker 2.0 and Bernanke 2.0. And so it is kind of a bearish opera. And the conclusion is that they operate over until the Fed, ladies things, a more optimistic tune. She was very concerned about financial stability. It's really the first time that Fed official talking about financial stability. And you said on the show that the financial stability is, in fact, one of the mandates. And the question is, how important is it? And I think it's number one. All right. Of course, Ed, your Danny of your Danny Reese.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,111,2022-10-03 19:07:38

10642," on the show that the financial stability is in fact one of the mandates. And the question is, how important is it? And I think it's number one. All right. That, of course, Edgar Danny of your Danny research. And he does think that there's one more rate hike coming in November. He says that will be it because the financial stability issue will pop up as a primary concern and something we have increasingly been talking about. Well, the thing is, is Mike McKee brought up earlier, is the question about, you know, how many more Fed Hikes is that important or is it more important to think about how long it's going to be until the Fed actually cuts interest rates. And I think, you know, he was making the argument that well, it's a lot more important for us to think about how long the Fed is going to keep rates high even though we're starting to see some talk of a pivot here. Well, and I thought too, like one of the interesting comments that he made too is this idea that the sort of the laser focus on the Fed's funds rate. And this was actually something that Taylor really brought up last week. The idea as to whether they should be paying more attention to the balance sheet and using that as a mechanism and that that actually might further their aims by limit, and at the same time limit some of the pain to the economy and to financial markets. And the financial markets is all the issue of liquidity concerns about, of course, the conditions, financial conditions, which are contracting. We had that note of course, Mike Wilson really shining a light on the fact that monetary and to the money supply really dialing back when you're suddenly to look at something in the US but globally, Japan and Asia and Europe, suddenly there that speaks perhaps at a better reserve that can release and ease that pain. But what does that mean for earnings in the longer term? Well, that's the big question and that's something that we brought up earlier with Gina Martin Adams who joined us on the program. Talking about what to expect from companies as they start to report earnings just a couple of weeks away from JP Morgan. That's a big one. She did say expectations are really, really low. So the bar is kind of low for companies to beat it. But we will certainly see when they start to report. All right, guys, we're going to be back in less than an hour's time across the last week. Can we talk him Kardashian then? What? Yeah. I said we buried the lead earlier at the top of our broadcast. We are going to talk about Kim K and the SEC. So that's what we should we take financial advice from? She's doing pretty well. I don't know about her bank account, but it's definitely looking better than mine. I'm just going to say, I don't know. All right, somber. No, okay. We'll be back. Hey, yeah. Don't take financial advice from any of us. From all over the country. Yeah, the $1.3 million fine is really going to hurt her. Yeah, exactly. Where should you get to find the money for that? Yeah, we're going to. Probably easy to write a check. All right. Probably not in crypto though. But too soon. Too soon. Yeah, I appreciate it. I know. So we'll be back in less than an hour's time. Our cross-platform radio TV YouTube.

You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Monday. Carol Maser along with Tim Stenevek and we are waiting some comments from President Biden. He is in Florida getting ready. Puerto Rico. Oh, Puerto Rico for the gift. Yeah, for his first stuff. That's right. Puerto Lida this week. Yeah, exactly. And he's expected to announce a big packet in terms of funding to strengthen Puerto Rico's resilience to flooding. Again, obviously, we know devastated. Once again, by another storm this time around, the Hurricane Ian, of course. But they were just still dealing with the previous hurricane and trying to get back on track. Yeah. And as I mentioned, he does later this week plan to head to Florida. And there's also Carol. I mean, I think it's important to talk about the optics and politics of this too because there is a midterm election coming up. And especially when it comes to Florida and Ron DeSantis, the question of what it means for the federal government to help out the state and what we see from other Republicans in terms of aid packages and supporting the state because they haven't always been supportive of helping out in the wake of natural disasters regardless of the state. If we're talking New York, California, or Florida. Yeah, well, it's interesting. And there are times where many would say, you know, it's time for, you know, put politics aside and figure out what U.S. citizens need. Easy for you to say, right? It's certainly easy for me to say, but politicians certainly see it often very differently. President Biden has vowed to commit the full strength of the federal government and recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. And of course, also the U.S. mainland in response to the two hurricanes. Remember, it's Ian and Hurricane Fiona. And that's what really Puerto Rico is dealing with.

10644," Let's get an update on world and national news as we continue to wait for the President live from Puerto Rico for that. We turn to Nancy Lyons and DC. Hey, Nets. Thanks, Tim. Well, the U.S. Supreme Court says it will take up cases against Google and Twitter on the grounds that algorithms fed Islamic State propaganda so broadly they bore some responsibility for terrorists to tax around the world. Social media have been protected by a section of communications law that absolves them of responsibility for what users upload. Carter Phillips, a leading Supreme Court lawyer noted in a Bloomberg interview. The basic allegation is that YouTube and Twitter and Facebook, using their algorithms, were able to promote these terrorist acts because they allowed ISIS to communicate not only with its immediate membership but also to effectively recruit more broadly. The Supreme Court could reinterpret the platform's ability to edit content, which conservatives say has often been used against them in Washington or Chapman, Luba Gradyo. There are no specific threats to U.S. voting systems for the upcoming midterm elections, but the FBI said today the message that the results cannot be trusted is being amplified online. The messaging is being pushed in states across the country by political candidates and others in the U.S. and it's also being spread by Russia and to some degree China. It former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been testifying today as a government witness at the trial of Donald Trump ally Tom Barrick. Tillerson recounted for jurors in a Brooklyn courtroom how he was hired after meeting Trump for an hour in December of 2016. Trump then fired Tillerson in March of 2018. Barrick, founder of Colony Capital and a longtime Trump friend, is accused of trying to influence U.S. policy on behalf of the United Arab Emirates.

Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons, Inter 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. We are keeping an eye on Puerto Rico as we are expecting to hear from President Biden, and he is expected to announce funding to help Puerto Rico following the devastation left by Hurricane Fiona. So we are watching and monitoring that situation. As soon as the President begins to speak, we will take you there live. In the meantime, we continue to assess the costs and the toll as a result of a couple of hurricane that ran ever hit Puerto Rico and also the United States. Yeah. We're talking about the mainland, of course. Five years after, five days, excuse me, after Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida, bringing it with deadly storm surge. We're seeing catastrophic flooding and powerful winds. The destruction it caused is now becoming clear. The death toll, Carol, from Ian, is now at 58. That's according to officials adding to fatalities in Cuba and North Carolina. Insured losses have risen to as much as $57 billion. That's according to the modular verisq. President Biden, as you mentioned, scheduled to come to Florida this Wednesday. There, he'll survey the damage from what he described as one of the worst storms to ever hit the U.S. Biden right now in Puerto Rico, where the U.S. government has pledged more than $60 million in funding, tell the island rebuild after Hurricane Fiona. And what's interesting, if we just take it, go back to Florida. And of course, those cities looking to rebuild from the devastation of Hurricane Ian will be financing their efforts during the worst environment for municipal barring in more than a decade. I mean, there's so many different macro stories that are underway at this, at this time, and you look at the devastation and what it will take in terms of time, cost, effort to rebuild the impact, particularly along that Florida coast, so that is certainly something. And I would say for Puerto Rico, I feel like it's been one devastation after another in terms of trying to rebuild as a result of storms. I think there are also important conversations that will be had in the coming weeks and months about where exactly should be rebuilt and where shouldn't be rebuilt. If you do have storms like this hit so frequently, are these areas where people should live? Yeah, I was talking about these coastal areas. And I think in terms of flood insurance policies, I don't think they were able to get federal. They weren't able to get federal? I thought they weren't, and I thought there was a state agency that actually did it. But you do wonder, we've talked about it here even on the East Coast, where there are a lot of homes along the coast and the beetle community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,113,2022-10-03 19:15:51

10646," that actually did it, but you do wonder we've talked about it here even on the East Coast where there are a lot of homes along the coast and the beach communities I should say and then there's the questions about rebuild and who covers those costs specifically. So it's a big question. In terms of the cost of the effort to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Fiona, it will run into the billions that's the head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency right now to Puerto Rico and the President. The headline to read, Biden rings storm to Puerto Rico. So I'm going to maybe have to cut this little short. Let me start off by saying that Jill and I, and thank you very much for that lovely introduction. Jill and I are more anxious to be here. You know, we, I come from a little state, the little state of Delaware. It's not like the Congress from New York. She's in the big state, but we have a very in relative terms, large Puerto Rican population in Delaware relative to our population. We have the eighth largest black population in the country and between all minorities, we have 20% of our state is minority. And so I was sort of raised in the Puerto Rican community at home politically. And so we came here for a long time, both for business and pleasure since you're part of the third circuit court of appeals and Delaware as well. And I was chairman of the judiciary committee spent a lot of time in the northern part of the state. But look, it's people like you who do so much for your community and they're going to make such a big difference as Puerto Rico rebuilds. Thank you governor for your partnership as we work together to help rebuild Puerto Rico. And I mean rebuild it all and rebuild it in a resilient way. So you don't want storms come again, which they will. They're not having the damage they caused before. I want to thank the members of Congress and local officials, community leaders of join us today ever since the hurricane struck Jill and I have had people in Puerto Rico on our minds and in our prayers. We came here in person to show that we're with you. All of America is with you as you receive and recover and rebuild. I'm confident to confident we're going to be able to do all you want governor and I'm committed to this island. Puerto Rico has been through so much in recent years. Hurricane Maria five years ago is 6.4.4. And magnitude earthquake two years ago, the folks slept outside for days worried about their homes and collapse on them. If they went in, then COVID-19 and then Fiona. And yes, Puerto Rico is a strong place. And Puerto Rico is our strong people. But even so, you have had to bear so much and more than need be and you haven't gotten the help on a timely way. And this latest storm, Delta series, blow to all, all the hard work that have been done since Maria. Rose and Bridges, build up to Maria have been washed away again. Families who spent their savings to build new homes after losing their last ones have seen them flooded away. Crops decimated, farms destroyed. Here in Ponce and communities nearby have been hit the hardest and in days for days people, people live without power, without water, some still that's the so-called meant no idea when to be back again. And for everyone, everyone who survived Maria, Fiona must have been an all too familiar nightmare. You know better than anyone that over time these losses add up. And so Puerto Ricans have lost loved ones in this storm and in the perilous disasters. And the number, the number can't feel abstract sometimes. You hear a number. But every number is a person. Every life lived. And they read the obituary as their remembrances and they all feel like people we knew, doting grandparents, devoted parents, Christian children, long time neighbors, people who cared about their community and made a difference. And they will not be forgotten. And then through these disasters so many people have been displaced from their homes, lost their jobs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,114,2022-10-03 19:19:59

10648," and made a difference. And they will not be forgotten. And then through these disasters, so many people have been displaced from their homes, lost their jobs and savings, their suffered injuries, often unseen, but many times seen. Yet somehow, the people of Puerto Rico keep getting back up with resilience and determination. Quite frankly, it's pretty extraordinary when you look at it from afar. And you deserve every bit of help your country can give you. That's what I'm determined to do, and that's what I promise. You're after Maria, Congress approved billions of dollars for Puerto Rico, much of it not having gotten here initially. We're going to make sure you get every single dollar promise. And I'm determined how Puerto Rico will build faster than in the past and stronger and better prepared for the future. That's why I approved emergency declaration of Puerto Rico before the hurricane. Governor, remember, I'm calling you. Before the hurricane made landfall, to deliver immediate federal funding to shelter people and provide a sense of support. Just a few days later, I approved an ex-plated Major's disaster declaration. That means federal government will cover 100% of the cost to clear degree and debris and carry out search and rescue and continue to shelter people. It also means homeowners, renters, business owners, are eligible to apply for federal help to recover damaged losses caused by Hurricane Fiona. Federal governments can provide individual assistance from the $37,900 for a central home repair. And another $37,900 for lost property is the law calls for, like a car or a refrigerator. Additionally, we've deployed more than 1,200 personnel from FEMA. The Army Corps of Engineers, the US Coast Guard, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, they include search and rescue teams to assist survivors and power restoration experts. Power is now back as you pointed out, government of 90% at 90% of the island, and water is back at 95% of the island. Thanks in part to the dedicated IBW workers and federal support staff. Now we have to get to 100%. And here at this facility, you can see some of the generators from FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers that were transporting the places that still don't have power. Here, here are the loaded on the trucks and brought to locations and hospitals and shelters, paired with fuel trucks so generators can be gassed up on site. My administration is also providing financial assistance to help families and individuals right away. Many families are scrambling to pay their bills right now to fill up their gas tank to put food on the table. They can register at FEMA, cash assistance for $700 to help cover the essentials for just a little while. So far, nearly 200,000 households across Puerto Rico have received this cash assistance. $700 won't replace what you lost, not even close. But it can help take care of some of the little basics while you catch your breath and get back on your feet. And FEMA has made crisis counselors available when you're a survivor or a first responder. If you need help, or just someone to talk to, people are here for you. The hotline number is 800-800-981-0023. I'll say it again, 800-981-0023. Don't be embarrassed to call whether a Spanish-ringly speaking counselors will be standing by to help you. Now, times like these, Americans come together. And I'm grateful for our personnel of FEMA and other agencies for the hard work these past few weeks. Many of our FEMA staff has been pointed out. All right, folks. She's been listening to President Biden there in Puerto Rico with the first lady. And he is expected to announce more than $60 million in funding to strengthen Puerto Rico's resilience to flooding this in terms of recovery efforts from the devastation left by Hurricane Fieno. So it's just one of the big stories, obviously, that we are following here in the United States. Yeah, again, the president in Puerto Rico today, but on Wednesday, he is scheduled to visit a storm ravaged parts of Florida where the death toll from Hurricane and right now is at 58. All right, so we've talked about a lot of things. Certainly, we've been very big macro. I feel like over the last couple of weeks, we've talked about the global dollar problem, the global race to hike rates, and the impact that's having in the global recession, that and more are just some of the stories.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,115,2022-10-03 19:24:32

10650," A, we've been very big macro. I feel like over the last couple of weeks, we've talked about the global dollar problem, the global race to hike rates, and the impact that's having in the global recession. That and more are just some of the stories that are top of mind for the editorial director of Bloomberg New Economy, Eric Schatzker, who's joining us here in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. I feel like when we think about the new economy for the world, there's just so much coming at it right now. There is, but as you correctly pointed out, Carol, few issues rise as high on the agenda as some of these macroeconomic challenges, specifically the higher dollar. I think this is something that escapes the attention of many Americans. And for that matter, many people and develop parts of the world, the impact that a strong dollar has on emerging markets is really, really hard to overstate, especially at a time like this when the entire globe is struggling with inflation. Is it all about repayment of debt, Eric, or is that only part of the story? Now, I would say there's a trifecta of headaches that emerging markets have to confront when faced with a dollar as strong as it is now. And by some measures, as you know, the dollar is stronger than it's ever been. It may not look that way on some charts, but if you make certain adjustments, it does look that way. On the one hand, imports become more expensive in local currency terms, right? And so that fans the inflationary fire. Secondly, your own currency, that is, if you're living in an emerging market, becomes weaker, and that can serve to stimulate exports, which stimulates growth, which is also inflationary. And then finally, to your point, Tim, yes, in dollar terms, and let's face it, most of these countries have historically and currently borrow in dollars, debt service payments become more expensive, onerous to the point where a number of these countries may face the risk of default in the coming months. If they can't find more local currency, the translates into dollars to make these payments. Right, it's just a reminder that these moves that we were seeing by central banks, in particular, the US central bank, like there are implications that are really broad. I love the story that has been around by Liz McCormick, and this was the cover of Bloomberg Business Week, that the US is like, we don't care, because this is actually helpful over the Fed, right, and it's fight against inflation potentially. It's hard to say, you don't want to put those words in J-Powell's mouth, we don't care. But to a degree, they don't. They have a job, right? They have two mandates, right? One is quote unquote, full employment, and the other is price stability. And price stability is paramount at the moment when you've got inflation running close to 9%, you have to get it back down to 2%, come what may, and come what may includes all kinds of instability in the emerging markets. I do want to point out that this is on the Fed's radar screen, Lail Brainer, one of the Fed's governors, vice chair, in fact, I said at a conference last week that it's important to consider how cross-border spillover, excuse me, spillovers and spill backs might interact with financial vulnerability. She's clearly pointing there to a worst-case scenario. So Eric, how does this story end? And how do we look at it? It doesn't end well. Well, right, it does. We have examples from the 1980s, from the 1990s. Can we look to those, or is this time different? Well, of course, the world will move on eventually. It's different in the sense that we're living with inflation right now. The last time the developed economies got together and struck what was known in 1985, excuse me, as the Plaza Accord, because it was reached just blocks from here, the Plaza Hotel, the Southeast corner of Central Park, Paul Volcker, the then-fed chair, had already succeeded in taming the inflationary beast. It's very difficult for these economies to get together. And of course, we're living in a very different world and depreciate the dollar when that runs counter to the Fed's needs. It feels like this has a ways to play out. We haven't yet seen inflation begin to moderate in the United States. We haven't seen the labor market start to weaken. We haven't seen inflationary expectations become re-anchored to something in the neighborhood of 2%. And the general consensus seems to be that some of those things are going to start to have to happen. The data dependency that the Fed is looking for before you can begin-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,116,2022-10-03 19:28:59

I love the story that has been around by Liz McCormick and this was the cover of Bloover Business Week that the US is like, we don't care cuz this is actually helpful over the fed, right? It's fight against inflation. Yeah. Potentially. It's it's hard to say you don't wanna put those words in J Powell's mouth. We don't care. But 2° they don't. They have a job, right? They have two mandates, right? One is quote unquote full employment and the other is price stability and price stability is paramount at the moment when you got inflation running close to nine%. You have to get it back down to two%. On what may and come what may includes all kinds of instability in the emerging markets I do wanna point out that this is on the feds radar screen lail brandered one of the Fed's governor's advice chair in fact a set it a conference last week that it's important to consider how cross border spill over excuse me spill overs and spill back My interact with financial vulnerability. She's clearly pointing there to a A worst case scenario. So, Eric, ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,405,2022-10-03 19:30:08
10652," And the general consensus seems to be that some of those things are going to start to have to happen. The data dependency that the Fed is looking for before you can begin to see the end of this movie. It doesn't appear as though a 1985 style Plaza Accord is on the table, Brian Deese. You know, in the White House recently said that he didn't see it happening. Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary indicated that she didn't envision anything like that in the short run. Yeah, and I mean, this is the tricky part. And we were talking about this with Mike McKee earlier that this whole idea of, you know, this Fed ultimately they will turn in terms of policy. The problem is we don't know exactly when. And at this point, whether it's inflation or whether the Fed keeps rates higher for longer, maybe they don't keep raising rates. These numbers are going to stick around for a while. And one of the worst parts for the emerging markets is that those economies themselves have to fight back by raising rates themselves or intervening in the currency market. We've seen Japan intervene South Korea and Indonesia in the Taiwanese, the Chinese have started to impose controls on their currency regimes. You know, many of those things, particularly higher interest rates, serve to crush those domestic economies, making it yet again that much harder to find the money to make the interest payments on their dollar-genominated debt. You did mention that for the most part, it seems that this is off the radar of many and who are in developed countries. I'm wondering Eric, if you argue that they should be paying more attention to the strength of the dollar and what it does to emerging markets. It's one of the reasons that we have the new economy form coming up in Singapore mid-November because we need to focus the world's attention on these kinds of problems. So of course, it's not the only problem. As you discuss on a daily basis here, there's the problem of climate change and finding a transition to new forms of energy and sustainability and resilience for that matter to point to what the president was talking about in Puerto Rico a huge editorial pillar for us at the new economy. But it's really hard to take your eyes off the screens at the moment because the charts tell the story. Yeah, and you do wonder, right, the new economy form right coming up at about a month or so and you do. Six weeks. Forty-one days, I believe. No pressure there, Eric. You know, Eric. But you do wonder in a market environment that is so volatile, you do wonder what the conversation will people will it have changed dramatically or will it be just more of the same at this point? Oh, boy. I mean, it's hard to know. It's hard to make that kind of a prediction. Sure. One thing is clear, again, if we're comparing today's situation to the one that this world faced in 1985, in spite of what happened during COVID, in spite of what has taken place in supply chains, in spite of the talk of de-globalization, this is a much more globalized world than it was, right, almost 40 years ago. And as a result, whether people want to pay attention to it or don't, the reality is policy makers at the very least. And the people making decisions at the highest levels of government have to be aware of what's going on in emerging markets. There are unanticipated spillover effects, the kinds of which, Lail Brainerd, the vice chair, the Fed was referring to. I don't know whether she had things like migration on her mind, but that's something that the Europeans have been wrestling with. It's not just because of war in Ukraine, it's because of war in other countries like Syria, for example. It's because of climate disaster, but it can also be because of economic hardship, right, which is a whole other level with this. Well, looking forward to more conversations to come. There are some really big issues. And I know you guys are covering it at the new economy forum. Eric Schatzker, he is, of course, the editorial director for Bloomberg, new economy, well known to our Bloomberg audiences joining us here in our interactive broker studio. Let's get to Charlie Pellet now who's standing by with a look at the markets because Charlie Pellet, we got less than a half hour ago. Indeed.

Kim Kardashian's going to pay $1.26 million to settle SEC allegations that she broke rules by touting a crypto token without disclosing she was paid for the promotion. Deborah Cunningham is a senior portfolio manager at federated investment management and this morning on Bloomberg surveillance she weighed in with our Tom Keane on that settlement. Well first of all let me tell you I was completely entertained by the discussion you just had on Kim Kardashian and celebrities advertising and promoting products especially financial products. Unlike dealing with the national inquire dealing with the SEC is a completely different ballgame and I think they need to learn that so thank you for that. The SEC said Kardashian was paid $250,000 to post on her Instagram account. Blue apron shares plunging suffering its biggest interday drop on record after the meal kit company stuck a struck a deal with canaccord genuity to sell up to 15 million of stock and reported third quarter revenue that missed wall street estimates.

I mean there are other people living like it depends on if you add up all the Kardashians together. I mean but other like her some of her sisters are worth more than a billion dollars. Yeah I mean they figure she's got her own plane. It's like a very expensive new plane. It's got a business that doubled its valuation earlier this year. Yeah. She's getting into private equity. Did you see that a few weeks ago? She's figuring it out I would say. Former guy from Carlyle. Is it? Yeah. What's running it? Yeah with with Kim Kardashian. All right the story that keeps on giving. All right right now though it's speaking of the story that keeps on giving. We have heard from so many Fed speakers we just talked about it deep dive into what's going on with the dollar as a result of a Fed policy monetary policy here in the United States the implications of so we wanted to talk a little bit more about a story that's on the Bloomberg and how we are beginning to maybe see cracks are early splintering when it comes to the Fed message. So let's get to it. We got Craig Torres with a federal reserve in US economy reporter for Bloomberg News. Craig this afternoon joining us on the phone from Washington DC. Craig how far do we have to squint to read between the lines of what all of these Fed speakers have been saying over the last week to actually find any sort of difference when it comes to the speed to peak rates. Not very far if you know what to look for. I would say it's best represented by two people right now on the one hand Cleveland Fed president Loretta master. Loretta thinks this is a very unusual and different environment where we've been above targets for months and months there's no sign of inflation re-lending and sort of shifting down to the gradualism that we offer many years in Fed policy would be a huge mistake. In her own words policies have to be asymmetric in other words being too tight is less costly than being too loose. On the other side we heard from vice chair I want to underscore that vice chair Lil Brainerd and she said well let's not forget about lags we've been running pretty hard here maybe it's time to start to be more data dependent and look around that's kind of where the debate is right now. All right so who's more important mom or dad no I'm just kidding but who's more important is it I'm assuming Lil Brainerd right she's the number two at the Fed.

It's running it? Yeah, with with Kim Kardashian. Alright, the story that keeps on giving. Alright, right now though, speaking of the story that keeps on giving, we have heard from so many fed speakers. We just talked about it. Deep dive into what's going on with the dollars a result of fed policy, monetary policy In the United States the implications of so we wanted to talk a little bit more about a story that's on the Bloomberg and how we are beginning to maybe see cracks or early splintering when it comes to the Fed message so let's get to it we got Craig Torrez with us federal reserve in US News. Craig this afternoon joining us on the phone from Washington DC. Craig, how far do we have to squint to read between the lines of what all of these fed speakers have been saying over the last week to actually Any sort of difference when it comes to the speed to peak rates. Not very far if you know what to look So I would say It's best represented by two people right now. On the one hand, Cleveland said President Loretta Master. Loretta thanks this is a very unusual and different environment where we've been above targets for months and months There's no sign of inflation relenting And sort of shifting down to the gradualism that we ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,407,2022-10-03 19:38:55
10656," giving more credence to one or the other, which I think is good. And second, remember that 2022 dots, we have eight and nine in terms of people wanting, how many hikes they want for the rest of the year, not eight or nine hikes, but there's one group that wants a quarter point more than the first group. So, you know, it's a healthy debate. It's interesting. The debate could shift to, based on the economic data, we get this week, namely the change non-farm payrolls that we see at the end of the week. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg are still expecting a 265,000 person gain when it comes to those jobs. That's less than last month, fewer than last month, 315K. Does any of this matter, Craig, if we get a blowout number in the jobs report? I think it matters. How resilient the U.S. economy is, right? It's held up pretty well. The job market, I think, is being driven by the fact that we're going to be short on a secular basis with regard to labor for a long time. And that story is about long COVID. It's about retirement and reduced immigration flows. Yeah. Right. Like, in terms of the longer growth impact, right? What happens on the other side of this and how we recover after this fed rate cycle, right? That's kind of what you're getting to. Glad you mentioned that. Because we're just, I think everybody listening to us should pay attention to this. Tom Barkin at the Richmond Fed is out with a beach today. We're seeing it in other fed officials. They're starting to talk about the new secular order, not cyclical. What is the world we're going to have post COVID? And it may be a world where inflation courses are a bit higher because we don't have abundant energy. Globalization is disrupted and labor supply is more limited. This? Okay. You just, Carol just put her hands up. I don't know if you saw on YouTube. She just like put her hands up like she's like, I've been saying this people. No, no, no, no. People much smarter than me. But the story that we did on Friday about the Cambridge professor, it was by. Yeah, it was the Bloomberg opinion piece. The Bloomberg opinion piece. And basically that the earth does not have an endless amount of resources. So if we think growth is just going to kind of constantly come from tapping earth, you can and was our guest. Mark Buchanan. Like we're crazy and we need to rethink. And I agree that it's, I love what you said, this new secular order. Life has got to be different with these big right crag macro issues, the shift of a fossil fuel. Yeah. And it's because of the impact of climate change. We're talking about food shortages. I agree, like these higher costs that maybe are staying with us. It's different post pandemic. Yeah, no, I don't want to be. Sorry, I'm like a little. No, I don't want to be malphousian and say, okay, everybody. Stop having children because the planet's resources are limited. What state does is technology and innovation. And so I'm, you know, but it takes years. That'll take like 15 years before we figure out how to get away from carbon maybe longer. I don't know. But in the near term, I think the big issue for the Fed is labor supply. It just doesn't look like it's coming back. All that. You look at labor force participation. Low, slow climb. Right. And I don't know what it is. You know, what do you guys think? Let's not say these are lazy people. Okay, I don't like that. No, I'm not sure why they're not coming back, but something's going on.

Let's stay in Washington, D.C. and it's a world of national news with Nancy Liance. Thanks, Tim. President Biden is in Puerto Rico where he's committing millions to strengthen the island's resilience to flooding. We have to ensure that when the next hurricane strikes, Puerto Rico is ready. Today, I'm announcing more than $60 million in funding to help coastal areas in Puerto Rico become better prepared for the storm. The money which comes from the infrastructure law Biden side last year. In Florida, more than 600,000 homes remain without power following Hurricane EN, but Kevin Guthrie that had a Florida division of emergency management says they hope most will have their power within just a few days. That is a goal that they are trying to hit to have all customers that can receive power by Sunday of this week. This does not include those areas catastrophically hit where there is absolutely no infrastructure, no homes and so on. Guthrie says debris removal will be taking place all week. President Biden is expected to visit Florida to see the devastation on Wednesday.

Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons, and our 991 newsroom in Washington, DC. Hey, we do want to talk a little bit about Peloton watching this stock in today's trade because this stock is actually up about 7 percent staying near the size of the session. Sounds like a gainer for you, Carol. It is. You want to know the funny part of this? It actually hit a 52 week low earlier in the session. Really? In today's session, even though that tells a story, given that it's a 7 percent gain, right? Yeah, and it's still down 79 percent. Here's why it's higher. We turn to Mark German's story from early this morning. Peloton is linked to deal with Hilton to put bikes in 5400 hotels here in the US. There are two companies announcing today that Hilton will be the first chain to offer Peloton bikes across all of its US branded hotels. The company's also said that members of the Hilton Honors Rewards program will get a 90 day free trial to the digital Peloton app and $100 off a bike, bike plus, or a tread purchase through January 1st. The standard Peloton app free trial is 30 days. You know what? I wonder if we could get a Peloton for the communal gym in my building because a little over a year ago, we tried to get one. Yeah. And Peloton wouldn't sell one to us. They said we don't do communal shared Peloton's anymore. And this was at the height of the pandemic when Peloton was struggling to actually fulfill orders. Right. And I'm thinking, wait a second, it's the tables have certainly turned. The companies now struggling to get users and to get those users to keep using these bikes. I wonder if they've shifted their sales strategy. That's an interesting question because you think about, I don't know how many people in your building you can have. I don't know how many users on a different bike. I think multiple, you do wonder, do each of you then pay? No, I think the building pays a fee and then everyone shares it and then maybe... And it just taps into it. I think so. I don't know what I'm talking about. Well, it's just in here. It's worth a phone call. You do wonder if they'll move into residential units as a way of boosting up their user base. But it would be shared just like it's shared in these hotel gyms. Yeah, exactly. And if you have people kind of just tapping and using more of the platform, that's a way of expanding its base. In the meantime, it's definitely getting the stock moving. Companies didn't disclose financial terms. Did say the deal will include at least one standard peloton bike for a hotel fitness center and the rollout will start in the coming weeks. So we'll keep an eye on it.

That's according to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. By the way, here's a pro tip if you wanna fill up with gas. Yeah. Try not to do it in Manhattan. It's been very expensive. Do I have the cabbage used to go to like New Jersey? I think they still do or just like within. No, not anymore The taxes are so are high there again. New Jersey used to be the place to fill up with gas for everyone. We'd always stop in New Jersey but then a few years ago, the gas tax went went higher. So, it's still. It's still, it's still, it's still, it's like just as expensive as it is in Brooklyn Interesting. Alright. So, going back to the EV charging sites versus gas station. So, Manhattan's EV charging sites now outnumber its gas stations more than 10 to one. Gas stations still dominate citywide 697 across all five birds versus about 520 charging sites but there too, the charges are catching up. You know, This is the thing we talk about. The most immediate reason for Manhattan's gas station scarcity has nothing to do with EVs land on the island is just too valuable to waste on a business that's minimally profitable and needs a convenient store a car wash to survive one by one though the broadcast stations have been bulldozed to make way for condos and offices so used to be on the west side highway you would say yeah.

How much is being maybe pulled off the cloud and rather keeping you know being kept more close to home. What do you see between that mix of up in the cloud versus you know on home territory in your own kinda hardware? Yeah you know it's it's such an important question and it's actually relates to this this pool that we just put out this transformation and ducks because over 70% of participants and respondents to this school said that hybrid cloud which is actually a little bit different than how you just maybe accidentally describe cloud a lot of people think of cloud is this place that you have to Things too. And that can sometimes be scary. We need to really seriously think about the security, the compliance, the data privacy, data protection, in that place when you're moving things to a cloud.

We see also with public cloud. That data protection isn't increasing topic. Even though you might say, oh cloud is about elasticity, your optionality, your global expansion The data protection factor here is is really important because every enterprise has a responsibility to steward their data you know you and I as as consumers as customers of of a bank or a retail organization we want our data protected and in in many jurisdictions Have an obligation legally to protect our clients data not just the reputation with the clients but also legal and from a regulatory perspective and when we look at this done in in the cloud conversation it's important both to have hybrid cloud where you can choose to continue to consume cloud technology while the data remains on premises as well as what Refer to his industry clouds were in the public cloud like with IDM's cloud for financial services you can have industry leading data protection and data privacy policies even when deploying in the public clouds so then you really have optionality you can have cloud on ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,425,2022-10-03 20:58:24

10703,Idiot and mean peg apps and contractor pay to the state starting March 2023. Hmm so The new report that shows employers they're not ready It's not ready are they Be released this report today so it's pretty fresh and what we found is two thirds of companies are saying that they are completely unprepared to post salary ranges and I think a big part of that is because companies don't yet understand why they pay what they pay and if you don't know that that's The first question and employees going to come to you asking once they see those ranges public Why is that so tricky for companies to know why they pay what they pay? And even when they pay and where there are gaps. Yeah it's tricky because of the old way of doing paquity analysis. So obviously this is what we do. We're innovating this with tech but the old ways to outsource it to a law firm. You Back a report once a year that just tells you your remediation or what you need to pay people to get out of the woods and you learn nothing about the underlying policies or programs that are driving pay so companies really need to start using Analytics to figure out are there pay policies and programs actually working as intended if they say they pay for performance for example which a lot of companies say that but You actually do So let's take alphabet and and Matta for example what would this mean for a company's like them which you know compete with each other for talent historically you know are known for paying folks quite well but like all most companies probably have pretty big pay gaps. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,143,2022-10-03 21:27:17

So let's take alphabet and and Matta for example what would this mean for a company's like them which you know compete with each other for talent historically you know are known for paying folks quite well but like all most companies probably have pretty big pay gaps. Yeah so the first thing they're gonna have to do is is get on top of their pay gaps because starting pay is the biggest factor in any pay equity analysis So, if you have issues or as a company, if you have a philosophy of start low, stay low, or pay top dollar to the best negotiator, that's going to very quickly Up with you from a pay equity and meeting pay gap perspective you're gonna start to have disparities that you can't rule out our because of something like gender eraser ethnicity so the way that we address As a google or a meta or an apple is to make sure you're not doing analysis just once a year but you're looking at this constantly as you hire As you you know god forbid have to lay people off. Are you having adverse impact? Are you letting bias creep in because bias requires discretion. It's oxygen and there's so much discretion in these decisions and the only way to avoid that is to really use data analytics to make sure Informing those and guiding those decisions well. Do you think this is gonna impact the labor market and if so how especially given that we are you know potentially heading into a recession I think the interesting thing will be to see how this impacts competitiveness in tech talent.

The first time, you know, people are going up into space and not sent there by superpower like the United States or Russia or China. Well, that's like really significant. And you know, you've you've gotta, you know, be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and you know, accessible for everybody. So, you can have fishing buddies going to space someday but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have, you know, a cruise selection process that could make space available to everyday people Hey ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,153,2022-10-03 22:10:48

And so with that, we wanted to have, you know, a cruise selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Hey Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024 there are two 1 billion dollars project called Axe Station will become the first free flying private international space station Or to use a more consumer friendly term. Space hotel. Axim is the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable igloo aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology like their B 330 Inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. Space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well this is likely to be the first kind of tourist Hotel that you're gonna see up in space. First of all, it's easier to carry instead of this giant tin can with with all of that. You play the wolver You know half the list and half the weight probably But even a space missions become accessible to civilians. But risks are going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a 1000 ways that we can think of and a 1000 other ways that we can't ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,442,2022-10-03 22:12:02
10725,As we cross this threshold from having astronauts and space to having real people like me in space And when we're able to make it to space reliably enough there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off There are so many gaps in space law that we are gonna have to put in a lot of certain basement ideas and so for example the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities Are So slip and falls. You step on something in the bathroom. You see the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. The bakeries of international law if something happens in space while boy you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft you can sue the company that brought you there you can see the hotel you can sue the individual you can sue every government related to that The way and the outer space treating the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about sewing and a court of law and so every single slip and fall in ace in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare And so we really need to figure that out before we before we start sending a lot of people there. Human rights and space here we don't think about a human right oxygen because it's Kind of all around us some free. In a space hotel. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,154,2022-10-03 22:15:04

Here we don't think about a human right oxygen because it's Kind of all around us some free. It's not in a space hotel. So, what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel Where that person it may be there 2 or 3 years without coming back To earth. So, a lot of things to think about Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Our space hotels I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news but at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're Pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or Some type of filament or fiber optic cables and and other things that you can do at micro The things that are actually You know, I high value Finished good when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having AA real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by Space Hotel. Really interesting and it will probably happen but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner Don't get too excited about booking a trip in one ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,443,2022-10-03 22:16:21

So, the founder of our company is Dave Crenklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his basically with his Was commercial spring of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating, and he had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer, Finally got to the point where he said, you know what? I either gotta get out of this business or I'm gonna innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed in this process has to take place a few times a year this means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure and so just like the tech bros to the north gust decided to solve all of its problem With robots. Sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer so that person is basically just watching all the vehicles On the screen they can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard and so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job so it tells them what speed they're driving the engine RPM the amount of Gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time.

So, if anyone in the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, lightar, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them They also rely on prebuilt maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here And then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command. This so this is the kind like the this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah so this is our our test orchard right here. It's right by our building and so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line. It's put through a Test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine. Autonomous computer, Safety systems make sure it's doing what is doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now, he's doing a test spray.

It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated. You have to really take a deep dive into each platform and my promoting on Twitter, my promoting on Instagram, my promoting on TikTok, what am I doing on YouTube You have to look at every possible social channel by 2017 big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising brands would help seed videos of their toys and if they were lucky Kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product.

Every Nasa achievement has been the collaborative achievement of Nasa and industry.
