They pulled off a multipronged strategy that was quite successful.

Hey The Belton Road initiative is China's president Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative Launched in 2013 it comprises an overland belt stretching through China Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past east Africa So a benign way of characterising China's belt and road initiative would be infrastructure for influence Shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as it showcase flagship project so the China Pakistan economic quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belton Road. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,479,2022-10-04 00:52:28

The release of cyber punk 2077 december of 2020 we'll go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history Instantly reroke the narrative of it celebrated developer CD project red. Largest studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of cyber punk depicts a process marked by unchecked ambition unrealistic timelines and a focus on marketing at the expensive development Project stock was at its high it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020 this was a game that was starting Keana Reeves this is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher three this was supposed to be the big temple release of last year and for it to become such a disaster for so many people I think we'll have pretty far reaching consequences City projects origins are somewhat unique in the games industry.

The witcher is a huge huge series huge fantasy series in Poland and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The witch of book series is a source of national pride in Poland And a city project released the Witcher two the video game series will become an important economic symbol for pollen as well CD project grad had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland and they were really big in the polish technologies scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most companies do and making a lot of money and in 2011 And Barack Obama came to visit Poland the prime minister actually gave him a copy of the Richard Tooth. I'm not very good at video games. But I've been told that Is Place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the witcher three in 2015 that would elevate CD project red from representing the best poland. To representing the best of the games industry.

Estimates put the sales of which are three at around 28 1 million copies in 2019. A huge step up concerning by 2014 the witcher and the which are two had only combined to sell eight 1 million copies and with two large expansions for the City project also helps separate themselves from other triple A publishers at the time. Ghost. Stupid that this has to hold on. Other games and the most notorious you know one to do this was EA's Star Wars battle front two they got really aggressive on microtrans actions in a game that already cost at least $60 you could have paid more if you bought the premium editions but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,482,2022-10-04 01:07:22

They first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer. A beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman. And there was also some cool cyber punk stuff. Flying cars. Lots of stuff but it wasn't really until after the witcher three that said everyone began Really like building up this feverish level of hype.

They touted how each of these NPCs, there are thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system To create the most believable city in any open world game today. So, yeah. So, people were certainly blown away by the stem away 183 awards and just people left the theater just in in what they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake.

I I don't think I sing all person who worked on that game. Actually, thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020 So, in April of 2019, I probably should article for Kataku about the making of a game called Anthem which is a game from buyer where that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said Down in a whole lot like anthems. The deadline is unrealistic. The direction keeps changing. Things are flowing. We're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about anthem.

Over the course of reporting Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD project staff most of whom requested anonymity so it's not to risk their careers Decline the comment on the process or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times first pushing from an April 2020 release to September then November and once again December 2020 Meet the deadline. The studio would scale down the size of cyber punks main city. As well as cancelling some features and while those measures helped developers still said they were under significant crunch. Including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day 5 days a week and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this This was not a big secret in the office that a game was not going to be ready but A similar sort of thing happened with the witcher three and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks some of the best games ever made like we're created through this process I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games but it's it's one a lot of people too I think that management there has genuinely Change it early said they wanted to change it but it is proven very difficult ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,484,2022-10-04 01:16:00

Show me pictures entertainment is reeling from what maybe the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in a Hollywood history. Hackers attacked in waves. First crippling Sony's internal systems then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures On the interview saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Tony pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the Free world.

North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The justice department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt to death of billions of dollars from multiple Companies. That was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks In my aim was Operations are like. And on what your dreams and fierce war. Man, man, man, My name is Sam Kim I'm a reporter for Bloomberg News. And I wrote a story for business week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime 70s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, And even use Germany to learn coding it was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home But in some time in the 1980's and 1990's the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a An army of people who could have for North Korea's military.

Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. Doesn't cost them much money But if you have the right people And if you have the right training You're able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's why North Korea is after But if you consider the fact that there are only about a 1000 IP addresses in North Korea available. And many of them are basically From Chinese communications companies You kinda tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well First of all.

It took me at least half a year to track down these people it felt like a water goose chase in the beginning. Because See a lot of the people like these Protective by the government in South Korea But at the end i was able to find a person who had pretty expensive ties to the North And then i was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking for North Korea before coming to South Korea. Hey John is one of them John actually is not a real name I knew before meeting John that he was in his late 30s.

So, if you're thinking about Macy's or Years or JCPenney those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food but you really had to have you know reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bringing all those people they tend to pay very little rent around 80% of income from all owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s the malls were beginning to compete with each other We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada we have on seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe Retail spending across the board malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Started to suffer in the early 2000's with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall, and then see a bunch of other people. You could just do it from the Of your own.

Greenbrier Mall in Southwest Atlanta Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So, for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta. That's predominantly black Also is middle class neighborhood It started with anger stories that were department stores so we had JCPenney and then Riches which was later bought by Macy's so you had these To national chains The first Chick fil A in a mall like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls like Greenbrier had like the perfect template. But now Macy's will be exiting the mall meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into What's there next strategy ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,489,2022-10-04 01:37:31

You like to hang out, see your friends, and also kinda be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic about 95% of gen Z.

But thanks to lockdowns across the country most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020 That means no one using the multibillion dollar American dream malls indoor skislo. No one going to the king of pressure malls indoor skydiving attraction Basically the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need another problem What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So, our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period.

Out of a 1000 malls in the country. There are roughly 250 mi. We grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls which is the vast majority of the malls by count. We think we're on a negative trajectory and it's gonna depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership Decisions around how much money to invest in the property.

And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. A lot of community think this is an opportunity you know to read about To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for The number one reuse of an existing mall is as work space. It's actually pretty easy. It just Got a few more windows and turn it into office space. Great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls Then the third strategy that I still I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and regret it Reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the Or providing community parks and gardens While most analysts say post pandemic retail shopping could breed some life back into the American mall many are not long for this world depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit grab some food ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,202,2022-10-04 01:44:44

Oh, I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is, how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans a company that prided itself from taking care of its own laid off 120 people roughly 20% of its workforce When we decided that we're gonna start doing things differently.

It started with the costly move to recycled an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion And Patagoni's influence was growing. What was intended a shoe and a philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in 10 languages What's interesting to me is that all this I hate the term on brand but it's very on brand it really works for the kind of company he's created it works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain it all it's very seamless in terms of the identity Of him and the company and and what it means In the marketplace. It's over time the company's mission Marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011 Black friday Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times That said don't buy this jacket And it sort of Got into the nitty gritty on You know, the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into, you know, a peaceful peril like a parka. And at the time shown art said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it need to address the issue consumerism which coming from a for profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less it's annual sales increased by almost 40%. Talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it.

By the environment, by your employees, by your community, and that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people. Consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So, what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia and the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company Quadruple it's private but estimates are it does about a one 1 billion dollars in annual sales which is sizable And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortune cycle as it's ramped up it's activism and become more vocal on these things it's resonated with the market As the company brunched out into other areas including adventure capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food revenue reached a new peak of over one 1 billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavy weights like Nike who made 37 1 billion dollars that same year Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized bests have become the go to corporate uniform. Expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagucci.

I think the the narrative was written before I got here. Yeah. And what I find most interesting about that is I Believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long term growth. If you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline and I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing Industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition everything can't succeed and so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not because if everything's Or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough. You're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're gonna get there. So, to me, Natural part you know kind of a sister Redeploy those resources to the top. They go together actually and so I find the narrative.

What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So, the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so, you know, there was, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about Liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy 6 to 12 months prior to build in durable equity you couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate you need to do that ahead of time it needs to be all of the work That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. To me. You have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. Think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume, you know, we can keep investing in everything.

More in the the smaller ones in the add ons to be fair But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do think that there's there's still upside in a lot of different areas. So, would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions Be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them at the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar and everything we're doing address what is most helpful for our us Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies How are those conversations with regulators going are they frustrating At this point. Well, there's certain elements that that are frustrating because I listen to Outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy.

Why shouldn't we view google as a monopoly? So, you know, I go back to the earliest days when Google, In 1998. There's like eight search engine. The questions, why do you actually need it? And back at work and Stanley, it's working with our research channel. It's very unique. She actually had her team put up a white pages all around the conference room Was doing this comparison?

They're also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employer?

And I learned a couple of really important things Given breakthroughs in medical technology I learned to love the word manageable. These, this journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about. It is manageable, get the best care, Just plow through it. I was just very grateful and grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years. But for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer other than themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gust. So, that's what I did.

I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. You know, we had a cubicle. There was a there was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room.

So, we're giving people choice to move anywhere in the world. 4 weeks taken work from anywhere.

It's a moonshot to be 24/7/ carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% 19. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030 and to do it globally that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies including carbon capture etcetera over time. So, that's what excites me. We are technology company at heart. So, There are many answers to this problem.

Things journey of humanities, harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus.

New AWS CEO Adam Solipski You work for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tablo software 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well I was having a one on one at at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else has did and to Jeff Bezos has taken on a new role and Andy Jassie's On the the CEO role of of Amazon Of course Sandy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years so of course I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking and you know the conversation turned to to some of the possibilities and next thing I know little while later here I am back at Amazon absolutely delighted and honored to CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? I knew of course was you know knew the IWS business best and of course it's taking on the CEO role but yeah there was you know contact as you might expect with small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me not that I need a reminder but that it has really still day one ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,221,2022-10-04 03:07:15

You're into the job. While you were gone that surprised you. Why I think that's so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're they're going all in. So, I mean it was a pretty decent size business when I left but it's really grown and the the customer base is really expanded and so now we have a very deep relationships at the CEO level, the Oh level across every country Industry every use case and we're regularly interacting with The most senior people at their client organizations. So, you were working at Real Networks. Yes. In the early 2000's and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So, it was it was it That you know the company didn't wanna talk too much about it but of course you know we had to talk a certain amount about it so the call I got when something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,510,2022-10-04 03:08:45

We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more Layers into your company it's it's all too frequent that you start managing math you start managing ratios and percentages and growth and I think it's it's real disease if you if you stay away from really folks singing at a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you and so we try and organize a Both with our work structure as well as just with with our culture and what we choose to focus on. I'm really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things. Product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged that level ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,222,2022-10-04 03:11:33

Now, Think the cloud keeps getting bigger and that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever expanding pie or at some point doesn't become a oh some game and that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody. Well, this is a very large market segment and if you look at global IT spend, it's it's in the trillions of I've seen estimates like three 1 trillion dollars. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very very large and we've always believed that this was too good. A market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough if you've seen robust competition emerge and and we all compete vigorously but it is the second is just growing so rapid That I think really for us we believe that you know the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to folks not on the competitors but to focus maniaically on customers and wake up everyday understanding exactly what it is that they need to build next and then Work backwards from there back internally to how can we build those things and if we if we do the best job at building the most quickly the things that are most important for our customers then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do.

I think commodity similarly have been thought of as a way to hedge against inflation. There are challenges over the long term equities have been a hedge against inflation. We will continue to do what we have done in the past which is build a diversified portfolio where there are many Opportunities that have the the possibility of heading against inflation because different types of inflation have to be hedged in different ways. So, if it's a very quick increase in inflation as opposed to a slow rise of inflation. Is it temporary? Is it it long in a persistent type of inflation? So, for us, I never model myself in economists that can predict where inflation is going. And so what I need to do is build a diverse portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation and to pay close attention to it.

Yes Anna the move was a surprise ah even though Governor Philip Law had signals a potential ends to outside interest rate hikes up and he had repeatedly said that ah as interest rates go up the you know we will not be increasing You know 50 basis points he hadn't said it in so many words but he was kind of signaling that you know 25 basis points was coming the one of the biggest reasons is that they have already raised by a lot in a very short span of time and the second biggest factor is that inflation is As high in Australia as it is in the US and UK ah the wage price spiral that we are seeing in elsewhere in the world is also not you know we are not saying that in Australia wage growth is ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,551,2022-10-04 06:08:18
10943,So yes I I don't think there's there's quite a read through there because of this different signals that we are getting from from Fed BOU or even AC That's why I say thank you very much. 20 lb day joining us there from Sydney with the latest on the RBA and to some extent the global tightening cycle. Let us bring in another voice. Yo Han Yarvis join Did a cheap strategy at SEB and Yohan we've seen the combination of the ISM data and this moved by the RBA adding up to quite a lot of risk appetite I wonder if you think that's misplaced or if we're onto something new here. I think it's still too early to say but I definitely wouldn't rule out that this is actually the start of something that that is a bit more positive for markets and I think the ISM numbers that we got yesterday they were Really good for markets and really good for risk appetite. We're now just shy one index point from going down into contract contractionary levels for the ISM. When you look at the the components making up this index that employment is still Very well below the 50 mark. This is something that the fed which is as we know preoccupied with labor market strength. This is something that the Fed is bound to pick up on and I I think it it was really good number and Perhaps that's the wrong way Pricing it but hopefully we will see more of the same in terms of US micro numbers going forward. It does put us in a difficult position doesn't it when we're actively looking for bad data to be positive for risk assets Yohan but that does seem to be you know if you're long of risk assets that is going to be what you're looking for and we're gonna see plenty of opportunities to to to ask those questions later this week or today in fact we get the dots numbers then Thursday claims and Friday non-fam payrolls do it ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,263,2022-10-04 06:11:10
10944,"The snack for numbers going forward. Yeah, it does put us in a difficult position, doesn't it? When we're actively looking for bad data to be positive for risk assets, Johan, but that does seem to be, you know, if you're long of risk assets, that is going to be what you're looking for. And we're gonna see plenty of opportunities to to to ask those questions later this week or today in fact, we get the jolts numbers, then Thursday, claims Payrolls. Of weakness do you think we need to see in the US labor story to to trigger thoughts substantial thoughts or even commentary around a pivot from the fed? Well I think that normally the labor market this is one of those lagging indicators that are quite late to turn in the cycle so I think that the market is still going to focus on these these early early indic Status of labor market weakness going forward The more of those we see the better and and we need to remember that it it will be harder and harder for Central Banks for the fed to convince markets that rates will We'll Go very much higher and also of course that race will stay high for a long time which is of course the story that the fed is is pushing right now Two things will be more difficult as the economy continues to slow. Okay and I wonder what you make of the latest Fed commentary we've had certainly Some voices at least not giving any signs of any pivots and suggesting that we're not necessarily there yet when it comes to hikes so the feds Williams talking about how fed policy is still not restrictive You know, is that something of a warning for these surging markets? A warning not to get ahead of ourselves. Well it's been definitely a very a very strong message from the Fed in that directions from a lot of different fed members and and that unity within the Central Bank is something ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,552,2022-10-04 06:12:35
10945,"Levels of cash that they would associate with a full capitulation. What would you make of those sorts of comments? It's it's very difficult to evaluate where we are in this in this in this downturn and when you often investors and I tend to do that when I when I meet them Get very different answers some say we are still very early and in in this decline while while some say that we're already in this situation but there's basically blood on the streets and and it's the buying opportunity of a life Or less but but I mean I think that stocks are are not about to turn decisively higher in in the near term and Providing that we see a continuation of this positive trend that we saw Today for some time I think it's more likely to be a bear market rally than down the sort of a more sustainable turnaround for stocks.

Er let us turn to your UK politics though where we have seen volatility of late some members of Liz Ross's Say the UK Prime Minister will struggle to drive through key economic policies Is already so damaged. This according to some senior conservatives talking to us here at Bloomberg. Let's bring in Bloombag's Lizzy Burton who is at the conservative party conference in Birmingham. Lizzy, we just showed live images. Of course, still very early at the Conservative Party Conference We too much into the fact that it's pretty empty at 715. But it appears we've had a lot of they've been very busy over the last 24 hours. Er the lady as we established was returning it would seem and certainly on the politics yesterday and today on some of the things that are spooked markets. What do we know? Well I know we've had this reversal in the top rate of income tax cut that was a political measure it had become political Toxic. It was clear that it was not going to get past Tory MPs in the House of Commons and so Liz Trust has pulled it back before she suffered Humiliation. There's also The chancellor is going to bring forward his medium term fiscal plan and the office for budget responsibility forecast that would come Side it. It was meant to come on November the 23rd. It didn't come when the announcement was first given. Er and that essentially knocked the credibility of In the eyes of the market so that measure is for the market but we still don't know exactly when it's going to happen the chancellor says shortly and the concern remains fundamentally that aside from the energy ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,554,2022-10-04 06:21:16

Otherwise I think that UK is probably facing the same kinds of challenges that we see in the rest of Europe and in in that sense of course all European assets look as being perhaps a little bit more under stress than what we see in Parts of the world especially in the US. And I mean in terms of the UK story Johan The commitment from the chancellor continues to be a relentless focus on growth. See a conflict between a relentless focus on growth at a at a at a time when inflation is running at just under 10%. Are those two things in conflic For you. They are and especially this is of course what has been at the heart of this of the problems basically that the government is doing one thing and the central bank is trying to do or achieve the exact opposite thing but but it's policy and that is of course an interest of Interest and and something that markets never like to see and when you're talking about these these growth effects that are typically long term I think that we are not in that kind of an environment now where markets have much patience for those things. Now you want to see actions that take care Of the problems here and now and obviously the UK fiscal policy at this point in time is not addressing those those concerns that markets have.

And in terms of the European equity space credit sweeps making headlines Johan. Away from the specifics around credits we use although this is quite specific At the moment. We've seen a European bank with record low share price, record high, cost of ensuring against default. Does that send warning signals for you around European Or is this just too specific? Well it's certainly something that After then that's just Whenever we talked about this recession that most people now expect will come. It's been The consensus of the market I would say that this recession would be a lighter one because it would not intail this problems for the financial sector and usually you need The financial sector combined with a recession in the real economy to have this really harsh, painful, very, very long and deep processions And that didn't look to be a risk Now with this thing happening to create a switch I think a lot of investors are thinking okay is this a new leman which I don't think it is but I just want to stress that but nevertheless those concerns Emerge in a way that was not the case just a few weeks ago.

10953,"Of what you need to know ahead of those meetings in Luxembourg coming up we talk to the UK treasury committee chair Mel Stride he was calling for some of the moves we're hearing about around the OBR that conversation next this has been back. When the price of anything goes up the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices help spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again food prices are rising and fast Energy cost, broken supply chains, and surging demand. We're just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring.

Once again food prices are rising and fast Energy cost, broken supply chains, and surging demand. We're just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global weed trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds and oil nearly 20% of the barley. Now, throw in rising energy prices and Testing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crap field and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals for example, food goes bad. Take months to grow in a vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And is all these factors compound the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with bass consequence.

Now, returning to the UK politics story, the prime minister Liz Strass is under pressure following her. You turn on tax announced yesterday. Let's go to Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton who's out the conservative party conference Birmingham. You can take this the story forward for us to think about which parts of the of the of the of the trust quatting plan remain intact Lizzy. Thank you, Anna. Well, I'm joined now by Mel Stride, chairman of the treasury select committee. He's also a conservative MP Mel. Thank you very much for being with us this morning. It's been a victory for you because the chancellor is We understand bring forward his publication of the medium term fiscal plan and the office for budget But is it enough to restore credibility? Well I think he'll certainly help as a provided that of course this plan on the OBR forecast that abroad forward Incredible and therefore calm those markets put less pressure on interest rates going out which of course will be very important for those who have mortgages up and down the country but it really depends on the detail within that forecast but the fact that it's being brought forward is very significant ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,269,2022-10-04 06:37:07

So a positive move all round So we've had a U turn on the top rate of income tax. This seems to be a U turn on the OBR forecast. Where do you stand on uprating benefits in line with inflation? Could that be the Text you turn. It's conceivable. I there will be tough choices to be made and they will be broadly fleshed out in that forecast that we've just discussed. You've gotta remember that Will, the welfare upgrade, locked April, was relatively low because it's paid to the previous September's inflation rate That was quite low. So all the already starting on benefits upgrades from my friendly low bases it were and I think within the parliamentary conservative party it's gonna be quite difficult I think to go for an earnings based increase this time around rather than inflation.

Well I I think we we've got to sort of take a step back and understand that a lot of these kind of issues were not in a scent come to a head until further down the line so some of these measures will be brought through for example in a finance bill next year in the spring so there is a bit of Really just trying to study the markets. I think they've made 200 Move one on the 45 P rate and the other on the OBR forecast coming forward and to the extent those can really sort of calm markets and settle things down demonstrate that there's a clear plan that is fiscally credible and that's the important point then I think the government has an opportunity to build from there but On the current economic circumstances and given all the spending issues we're in play I'm doubtedly it's gonna be quite AA bumpy road but I think we need to not put the car before the hall so I think we need to just settle things down now and take a measured view going forward as these issues arise But having to make a massive view turn like this is of course really humiliating for Liz Trust at the start of her premiership now you've got Nadeen Doris of course a big Boris Johnson I calling for a general election is that What we really need.

So it was equal thanks says that his plan is going to be fiscally sustainable analysis by Bloomberg economics suggests that in To balance the books he'd have to cut spending more deeply than under austerity with George Osborne You see the spending cuts coming. It seems they couldn't touch hell for defense. If it's not going to be benefits where could these spending cuts come? Hey government row back on some of these tax cuts that it's And in terms of where well that's really difficult because what we know is inflation is much higher than was expected at the time that those Departmental spending budgets were set in 2021 and what that means is that those budgets have bought in real terms of already gone backwards and to give you an idea of the the level of the challenge here if we were to upgrade say welfare benefits by earnings rather than inflation which would be politically very difficult to ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,559,2022-10-04 06:42:51

Now, it's gonna be interesting. If others underbites, follow Terminal rate pricing for the fit a little bit lower this week than Were last week and of course we're seeing something similar from the UK after the UK governments a U turn on its fiscal policy so in a way it is quite interesting to see Australia sending the example here How vulnerable our bonds actually if we don't see a pivot from the fed to what the RBA did. You know I think we are starting to hear scatterings of slightly more devish from the fed acknowledging that they have to see a little bit of an impact of all the hikes that they've already done Liquidity concerns, globally, volatility, of course, that that rose a lot. I don't think we're gonna get any kind of pivo Do we get closer to a shift downwards in the rate hikes and maybe closer to a pause at this higher for longer I think that is becoming a bit more like They can acknowledge that it might cause they really don't wanna take their foot off the pedal and risk inflation expectations ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,565,2022-10-04 07:08:49

I think SE is correct Lights the earning seasons that are upcoming cuz that would be crucial to kind of gauging where sentiment really is. One of the things of course that we've been watching for is really that downgrade and future earnings expectations because Kind of the front line sentiment and equities are really getting downgraded but not necessarily being followed by that downgrade and future earnings expectations.

So trying to get from the 20 tens level of yields to a pre global financial crisis level of yields which is where we think we ultimately will be ending up over the 20s. I'm trying to do that in one mini cycle which is the the COVID cycle is is just too much for the real economy and for and for financial markets. So I think what we start to see now is the QE comes back in in a very different guys How it did in the 20 tens. It's much more of the sort of the budget response to try to provide liquidity where necessary in order to prevent yields from rising more rapidly rather than to try to keep yields from from shifting lower And I think the underlying forces here are much much wider than than the kind of the the the narrative at least around the the UK suggests what's what's happening here is that there's been a redirection of ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,324,2022-10-04 10:37:21

And then that process you're dragging yields higher. There's a lot there and I wanna just hone in a one You said the quantitative easing this time around is gonna look very different does that mean that you think the quantitative tightening is over and they were entering a new quantitative easing cycle of trying to reduce the pace of bond he'll yield Reese's. I think in as far as the UK goes yes I would say that that one state of easing is is sort of dead before it gets off the off the ground Yeah the the yeah one state of tightening thank you the Quan State of Titan just doesn't doesn't really get off the ground that you get this kind of queue that is is not the the same flavour as the as the 20 tens and it's there to to prevent yields from rising to to rapidly and that that is is probably the case for for Europe as well where If anything more worried than we are about about the UK with Germany already having suggested that they're gonna go out alone on the on the fiscal front where does that leave countries like like Italy where we'd be much more Read about those structural issues starting to to to rearise in the euro area therefore you get the move back to the to the TPI which ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,613,2022-10-04 10:38:54

These are all factors that I can have nasty costume inflation fact Speak to the need for higher returns and that the likelihood of higher returns in the in the 2020 that we just seen the fast forwarding of that in the In the short term but I think it does lead to to capitulation from central banks first in the form of pushing back against the the financial accel As we've seen in the in the UK in the pension funds fiasco but then in the case of Europe as a result of the the the slow down in in growth yes governments are are supporting the their economies Fiscal spending but that the cost of doing that there's no free lunch the cost of doing that is that yields are much higher so you're getting the spending on energy but it's happening at the higher higher yields and therefore the the property market in the UK and and the and yields more broadly are starting to tighten financial conditions and and Down on growth in in that math and that fashion. So central banks turn from worrying about inflation in Europe to worrying about to worrying about the financial accelerators and then growth and and therefore you get the capitulation in that sense I think in the US we are in a very different position here because inflation is more embedded and therefore the the policy response has to be still On inflation.

There's also this change of in the relationship in global labor markets and credit as well but the suggests that China is no longer a cap on on wage growth in in development markets. Therefore you have passed the wage growth. You also have faster faster credit growth than both of those things are inflationary.

So, they both feed into both portions of your equity evaluation. Earnings in multiples. One piece of feedback I've had across the Bloomberg today and I've seen this from multiple people. Reliable is this bond market right now we're really struggling it seems to price the risk free rate and if I can't price the risk free asset how on earth am I meant to price the risk I set have reliable this well the more volatile the tenure treasure is the more reliable it is that's what I would say why is that well because Are not meant to be static. The period that we had not just the last decade but the decade before was unusually stable yields even in the early 2000's you saw yields more or less muted versus what they were in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. That's not normal. When you get back to a more volatile tenure part of the curve where any given year, you can lose five% or make 10%. That's when the financial markets become for like better term vetted. They become properly priced. And Because 10 year olds themselves start to build in a risk premium for duration that's what we're starting to see it just so happens that a lot of folks don't like that and they haven't seen that in a long time.

It doesn't mean that you, it's it's it's reliable if you want to price risk assets. It's a distinction, right? Yes. And so, You draw the distinction of how much of a pricing it means for the global financial system to see a range that is true price discovery for the first time in decades. Yeah. So, the way to think about it is it makes it much harder to be a leveraged investor.

Yeah that's that's very fair these these monthly job figures that we get are are some of the last usually to turn on there are more lagging indicators but I think if you look at all the labor market data you know as a whole something like initial jobless claims which are still very low those tend to be a more leading indicator and it's still also pointing towards a really tight strong What is the the undershoot the blink by the royal the reserve bank of Australia what does that signal to city group Yeah I mean I'm not an Australian economist of course at all but yeah I think markets in general are looking for for this sign that maybe Central Banks are no reaching the the highest level of rates so they can get maybe we're at peak pricing but for the They would really caution that you know we've been here before. We've been looking for this peak before and it really hasn't happened. The fed is just gonna stay focused on domestic data and labor market data inflation and we really have to see any Away from labor market data what data matters to determine Peak. I mean definitely inflation inflation of course is still the most important and really since the September meeting we've had really just one data point for that that was PC inflation last week and if anything it looks like the Fed's forecast in September for four.

They said they're not going to get the I've take their foot off the accelerator until they see jobs really Less prevalent until they see the loosening in that market and you're not seeing it certainly in the initial jobless claim.

Er and now it's about 75%. And if you look at Lehman Brothers you know totally all the way around. Short term funding You know, trading liability, security is financing, all of that stuff. That was about 76% of their balance sheets at the time.

Like we still have a few more weeks of more shoes to drop. We really need to see the data crack. Joining us now to discuss his exotic Peter Chikini camera Dawson of New Edge Wild Cameron straight to you peak everything how many times have we done this and been wrong through 2022 Yeah we just did that back in June where we saw near term peak and yields we saw near term peak in the dollar that led to a big rally in stocks and also the pricing in of rate cuts in 2023 and then what ended up happening is that as the yields and the dollar got back to their trend lines what we saw That they started rising again and I think that is the risk here as we think about how long this rally in markets could continue from a stock basis is that we would likely see yields go back to their trend after we had that kind of big blow off rally but we don't see any signs of a trend break yet. 10 year can go as Three. Two% and still being an opt. In the last week is pretty clear. The 10 year yield is four% last week has gone down to 360, a 2 year older, just north of four%. It was 435 last Monday. Pete I get it.

That's what we're starting to see with J. P. Morgan. What does that mean to you of anything at all? Well I think that there is just a growing appreciation of what the real earnings risk is of course from a contrarian perspective it's good to see bulls crack and you start to see them throw in the towel I think from capitulation we still haven't seen that retail investor crack we still have about 65% allocation to equities It usually goes down to 40 45% during major bear market lows but I think that when we when we look at what the real economic reality is it is one we're earnings estimates remain too high we have lower the bar for three queue earnings we're going into earning season and expecting just three% growth compared to Earlier in the summer but if we look to 2023 it's still seven% growth for next year and we heard from Fed Williams yesterday talking about a pretty significant increase in unemployment that is not ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,359,2022-10-04 13:09:15

The threats of an asteroid hitting earth is very real If it's big enough it's also very final These are very very infrequent events. The probability is not oh though.

11173,"Amy let's get this one out of the way it's probably the question you get asked the most but how scared should we be? Australians and comments are a natural That's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events. These collision events where Object actually impacts the earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is, you know, when the next impact is gonna happen and how bad it will be What we know is that an object that's about say a kilometer across is capable causing very very wide devastation across the planet. Really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 km So, even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still gonna be very bad and we'll have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city, and it's surrounding environments, sort of around a hundredish meters. It depends on the details of the proposition and so for By the 1980's Nasa was cataloging near earth objects. In 1994 stargazers watched as comet shoemaker levy nine hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the earth. In the event became its turning point in the search for asteroids and comics in our solar system. In 1998 Congress task Nasa with finding 90% of asteroids and comets one km wide or larger. Soon after Hollywood blockbusters armageddon and deep impact for tension and fear to the masses ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,378,2022-10-04 14:33:19
11174,"Solar system. 1998. Congress task Nasa with binding 90% of asteroids and comets one km wide or larger. Soon after Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and deep impact for tension and fear to the masses The great news is that the vast majority more than 90% of all really large one km near earth objects have been found the challenge now is working down to the smaller sizes that are Quite capable causing a lot of damage but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. The number in the billions, most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter and what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the afternoons in the inner part of our solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There's another Somewhat close to the earth. These near earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 2025, 1000 something like that. When we first spot an object, we we really know very little about We just see something moving across the sky. So, all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about it Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle.

11175,"By training the network in this way you you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planets. And once it strains you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then, you can make a selection and saying, hey, this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planets. That doesn't mean that they do but it does it only means that they look very similar to once we we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? That we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went in in the gradient time they came Quite close to earth. Which we're not detected before or not considered being dangerous before him. He think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to send you a And they're going forward in time and ask for it that's gonna hit earth because What the earth is really small And what space is really big and then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that's goes and hits exactly earth. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from her surface Backwards in time. It's very hard to make a hit. So, you need a lot of Asians which all end up in nothing And the idea was then, like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what Nasa's doing. Now, she's taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbi And then see what fraction sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And then they call it a potential impactor So you calculate your shoulder system forwards in time for let's say a 1000 years ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,379,2022-10-04 14:37:38

Now, it's taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbi And I see what frection sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And then they call it the potential impacter. So you calculate a shoulder system forward in time for let's say a 1000 years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface You calculate them backwards to today And then you get your orbital parameters Of today's asteroid to which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known infectors. Simulations and and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex and is the physics to get more complex than mathematics becomes more complex And at some point you can't solve your problems and analytically anymore. And then this where the computer comes in. Now we have this train here on network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds. Whether not an estero. This potentially dangerous or not and therefore More attention Or more time to spend on for for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter We'd really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to to move an object aside. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,668,2022-10-04 14:39:09

In a departure from the lab and computer simulations Nasa has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection In 2021 the agency will launch dart the double asteroid redirection test mission which will intersect a 160 m asteroid in 2022 Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that survey the heavens. But that may not be enough Nasa wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our networking sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our our network of international observers so that we can get follow up As we find these objects when they're distributed all over the night sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data. We can make better predictions If you look at the big impacts we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years 50 years We don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters in my climate change is a problem with the global comments.

It uses a large central plant that cause water and then pipes it into banks residential towers and exhibition center shopping malls and the cities iconic marina bay sands hotel and casino complex So one of the biggest pugs of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage Compare to your traditional air conditioners. I'm with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power. This new system needs emission savings equivalent to removing 10 1000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter gets warmer there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance and the more people are buying these household appliances the more energy usage they they use and they release heat more and Accessive bits It's a vicious circle ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,391,2022-10-04 15:29:42
11200,Hey Ben access a bits Climate change. It's a vicious circle And so since 2017 research is at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of education that's a very important measure to mitigate heat because of the shading effect of course and deep psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the Possible Operative Effect of the vegetation. Can be of course on the ground floor Of trees and trops and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up to facades of buildings. And it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them prime minister Lee Quan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Campun Admiralty the community center that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,680,2022-10-04 15:31:07
11201,"Mitigate heat and effect You are in any building in a village as well. The first place to start is by shading The windows you have to keep Clear so that the wind can move through it water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade Less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration you have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range so ideally the electricity production is outside of the And you bring just a clean Into the city you cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs the facades of the city into Areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 2025 percent of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that With so many different ideas cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out it's called a digital urban climate twin or ducked there will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also be modeled the transportation The insulation ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,392,2022-10-04 15:34:20

With so many different ideas cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out it's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also be modeled the transportation The insulation The radiation coming from the sun. The weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very very microclimate of the city. Water. Movement of people in the city We can invent scenarios we can design scenarios test them before we actually built them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them Put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy slow climate change and improve our quality of life.

Intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complimentary source of power. Compared to other renewables on the grid if it Scaled up to commercial scale. For decades engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015 there were as late as bankruptcy in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous Proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity.

Today engineer is an entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few 100 kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave and energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago but in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive Diesel power or out at sea on gasty commissioning rigs or for parring underwater autonomous vehicles.

Close to the family and ask whether or not I would be interested in About Beverly Shottenstein and this case that she had against JP Morgan. Was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. So, I started just, you know, assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me that included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Sean Steen had a retail empire that has AX included big lots value city American Eagle Outfitters DSW shoes Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them enormous amount of wealth and around 1990 Estimates of her wealth were around 90 1 million dollars she for many years had that full of money being managed by outside advisors her grandsons in the late 2000's had both graduated were becoming financial advisors she gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,406,2022-10-04 16:34:58

In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kinda how you get your start. It's kinda the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business but Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably and around 2016 Well there were suspicious Things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own Says it was hard to really put it together Had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced so she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account Your credit card account. So we went to the bank and ask for the statements. Got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about Coming very very suspicious I will start to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender.

But the simultaneously sailing lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20 the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're gonna be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day.

So they're profit was the difference between Minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel for one group of traders operating from a small office. It was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this this had never happened before in the history of all trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where Interest rate you get paid on both side you get paid both to sell One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and it it you know you have to be clear this was a large risk yeah we spoke to oil traders both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a All trade is doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were.

11241,Regardless of what the facts are and so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud They they sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing but at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no My name is Ben Elgin I wrote the story about how the one 1 billion dollars market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who who been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Krexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project In 1988 In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties so to speak of greenhouse gases sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases When you put up a molecule of COtwo into the atmosphere it can be anywhere in the planet in 7 days. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,412,2022-10-04 17:00:56

And therefore, you know, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory for example, then, why not pay On the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions Then you are in a sense of setting your emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements such as the Keoto protocol which mandated the weal Countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. A business community it in general saw a carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effective We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or oh in out all of their carbon emission We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net oh.

If you look at for instance Disney that's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up Diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity So these companies are trying to make major major reductions in their carbon footprints but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Ridges and that's a plot of land most of the land is actually about 3 hour drive outside of Philadelphia Interestingly this land 3000 of these acres was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990's. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So, they they do what they they've done so well for all of these years which is they go They raise money from local phantopists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers.

They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits When it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits well that won't be incredible or truthful claim by Disney.

They've been around since 1996 What these offset registries do is they set up rules Carbon offset project has to follow those rules But there's this tension that's always there if the Carbon offset project to get up and running. So, there's this this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will Disincentivize projects from getting listed One of the the challenges with with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent, you have policy makers but but you know, the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the with the To really participate hard make a lot of things happen And the the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost, offsets, and a lot of them because that works for their business model.

New form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash 29 minutes from New York to DC 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogram But lately the hyperloop is becoming much more real. Yes. Real to be in sitting inside a hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea 6 years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1000 km per hour. But for many speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation We just sort of take for granted in the hyperloop world.

In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Mosque released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A hyperloop pod has been suspended in the tube. Usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air res Or rolling friction that would push back against the pod the hyperloop is able to move it incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently Despite its futuristic name however the general concept behind hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in 1870's was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived however only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 mph. Well Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow of a 21st century name. He wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. Like to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper. Digging the ruck was at tunnels via his boring company ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,704,2022-10-04 17:15:09

Yes. It's a short run it's about 500 yards or so Came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter per mile at just over 100 mph. Is a long way away from a true functioning hyperloop? But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors are from project proponents or just people in general Better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology there's no easy task First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because you know, it's faster than driving and most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before they've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show the hyper loop could be safe with two normal people not astronauts not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that too normal people getting on a hyper lube and then most importantly those two people getting off ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,416,2022-10-04 17:18:23

But Beyonce concerns constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 1 million US dollars per kilometer of track so a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles for example is likely to come with a price tag over 10 1 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in in front Costs investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because your developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technology, right? So, this idea that because the smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So, who were like the Vanderbilts of this century and that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses.

11251,"They want to go when they want to make those journeys and doing it in much smaller numbers so pod designs for hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats typically Why are they small It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. I'm a great example of that is the east west strategic route across the north of England from Liverpool to Manchester to leads. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to By train is just short of 2 hours today. It'll probably take you 2 hours driving as well in in average traffic condition That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds. There's very little commuting traffic Between those urban areas Hyperloop Changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is 5 or 6 minute journey Manchester to leads is also a 5 or 6 minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision the hyperloop acts a little more like a highway where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a hyperloop network from say Liverpool to leads while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop.

And if that metro hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop. For passengers For business For leisure that is utterly transformational For high value freight and logistics it's equally transformation Book critically If you do a high pollute network at scale. You begin to deliver Massively significant carbon savings to A multi-regional hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation both of which are significant carbo One hyperloop connected distribution hub Perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight. Replacing maybe 10, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck horizon off the roads. That it's so means roads gay next to a capacity. Hyperloops will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube So the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the hyperloop itself.

11253,And it does things you can create a complete high group network To travel for example over I think Europe for example with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city The nice thing about this magnetic lavitation system that we have developed Is that there's absolutely oh moving components in the track I'm so for example if you have to do a lane switch All you do is that's the two basically splits up. And statically the tracks also split up And whenever the vehicle enters a switch it either pulls itself to the right with this Or pools itself to the left with magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even moderate magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. Very crucial elements because this is the thing that limits the capacity In the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching that means that a dead moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it so you need a lot of space between trains Because you have no moving components in the track. All the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have a vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though Heart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube Because the test track is only 30 m long they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 km per hour however the company is working to build a new test site ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,418,2022-10-04 17:27:00

We're not gonna face where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network If you'll look at all the top systems that it consists of most of those are proven systems. Already demonstrated in lap conditions. So we don't really believe that's the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all hyperloop companies out there actually building a hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects we're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects. Do people feel comfortable travelling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant. Needs to contribute to bring this to market.

11255,Create the first commercial hyperloop tracks between individual cities. 1 day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperloop is a future transport system. Also realises that there is a need to have this network because that's where a hyperloop Hey Use project it's definitely not something that that you can do in your own or as a single company So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have to governments. I think that sends the biggest challenge that we can count it. It's a really get all the required parties together. To take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Heart's next plan is to build the European hyperloop center an open testing facility which will include a two. Six km test track and the company hopes to test travel speeds there and up to 700 kg Forever. Virgin hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route with projects and various states of development in India Saudi Arabia in the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a hyperloop certification center in West Virginia To six mi long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make the idea there's multiple hyperloop companies I think is a redeeming aspect in the business People really want to see something happen so having multiple people move forward Is is good for that I was struck When Sarah rode the pod. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,419,2022-10-04 17:31:21

It's a new year so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change and one of those is as old as the universe itself hydrogen it's the simplest element around but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels Hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize but it has far more uses as well from powering cars to heating our homes and Bloomberg new energy finances a Shift in the sector in the next 10 years as green hydrogen Dirty alternatives. Hydrogen dominates today but as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible so will green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change we'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron or two hydrogen and we'll also With the CEO of Italian utility companies spam about his book Hydrogen revolution But first what are we using hydrogen for and why does it actually matter Christine Lee Edwards explains.

It's certainly does. It it helps with that. I mean, I I'm not sure anybody thinks we're gonna be totally independent.

So this is really more than blockbuster status. This is literally half their business this given year. And it's a major success but the question is are they a victim of their own success and at what After you ride the roller coaster all the way up. Alright, also join the conversation, the editor of Blueberry Business Week Joel Webber here in studio with us So Riley if you've got this blockbuster success it it starts to actually sound like Hollywood a little bit you know you just roll it become a blockbuster factory You gotta be kinda like seeing around the corner. We're like, what kind of, what kind of bets don't we know about yet? Yeah Pfizer is hoping that they can take the Messenger RNA technology behind its COVID-19 vaccine and apply that to other disease areas to continue to turn out blockbusters next year we should expect to see data from its mRNA flu vaccine and after that they're working on shingles they're Tackle cancer and rare diseases through Messenger RNA but there are a lot of questions as to whether or not any of those products can reap the same kind of success we've seen from the COVID-19 vaccine and couple that with some major generic competition that Pfizer is facing before the end of Decade.

I know that you know we spent the last 2 years talking about mRNA but what does an mRNA flu shot do that's better than a traditional flu shot which by the way it's flu shot season everyone in case you do it is flu shot season so the hope that Pfizer and it's competitor Maderna have here That they can really compress the production timeline for a shot. Part of the issue that flu shots aren't as good as we'd really like them to be is that ultimately scientists around the world they convene twice a year once for the Hemisphere once for the Southern Hemisphere. They have to give quite a bit of lead time to be able to produce those And as we now know with COVID viruses mutate to survive influenza is pretty good at doing that too and so ultimately over that long period the virus tends to change and the vaccine is often less effective than we would hope so Pfizer is hoping it can take that same model that we saw with COVID and apply that to flu and ultimate Get a more effective flu shot. Okay, so even if they do that though, I mean, COVID, the ease numbers were insane. Like, what? There's a reality here, you know, maybe a bullish projection and then, something, something a little smaller than that, like, what are the, what are the analysts have to say about what the bottom line ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,727,2022-10-04 18:56:29

We would think right and like there is that version of this where your booster and your flu shot like all magically become one and we use a marine You got it Joel. Gonna wait. It won't be happening this year after eight 2 weeks from getting my COVID booster to get my flu booster. So, just you know, arms full of my calendar. Are they is there a conversation about keeping these things separate and maybe that's more lucrative than if they're one. So ultimately Pfizer has said that it wants to do a flu and and COVID combo but I think we're still a couple years away from that. We need that that flu shot that Messenger and a flu shot to come to market And the earliest state is next or earliest time frame is next year for them to be able to do that but look at uptake of boosters now I mean Bloomberg Intelligence put out a memo today showing that only two.

I do wonder too. It comes just before the midterm. So, how does that? Oh, but these are not politicians, Carol. Really? I don't know. I mean, there are pointed by politicians. They're not voted in. I Every tower that you. Did you, do you like how my I'm so not cynical? No, I do love it.

I mean, first of all, energy is a big macro story of our time but as an equity play, it is the top performer in the equity universe this year. Yeah, what is Quarter though look like a specifically for those midstream firms in this inflationary environment we turn to store glickman head of energy research at CFRA research he joins us and once again on the phone from New Jersey Stuart how are you? Good. Thanks for having me, Tim. Yeah, it's good to have you back with us. Hey, talk about a little bit about the the news that we're seeing from Opec Plus over the last 48 hours. Know that we've seen oil rally. Because it's not actually, it's rallying because of, you know, production cuts. So, so talk a little bit about how you're interpreting that. We're potential cuts I should say. Yes potential cuz there's a lot of intrigue as to how much Opa Going to be cutting but further their first in person meeting in in more than 2 years I think people are expecting something of import is going to happen and I I think what's going on here is that the Opec Plus Consortium got quite accustomed to oil being north of $100 a barrel and they've watched it dissipate pretty quickly pretty dramatically Down from you know 120 or so per barrel down to below 80 I think they're trying to ratchet back up again. So Talk to us cuz I do think what's really important to the energy equity trade right now is the macro story I was listening to i think it might have been Bill Smith earlier on with her surveillance team this morning on radio and TV or radio And just that with this pivot that we're seeing in the energies space Means that there's going to be you know On exploration and so on and so forth but that does ultimately mean higher prices which is gonna benefit ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,445,2022-10-04 19:25:37

So it's it's certainly part of the carol yes long return there's gonna be a transition away from fossil fuels towards renewables But the supply tension that we're seeing the fact that spare capacity is thin this is a problem that's been brewing for about 7 years now the industry has been kinda systematically under investing in new supplies Partly because oil prices didn't merit it with oil prices for the better part of the last 7 years were pretty pretty mediocre or worse. And then also Some of it is is quite honestly coming from institutional investors Which toll the industry repeatedly That they would much rather see them focus on Returning cash to shareholders in the forms of dividends and buybacks and less about growing the number of barrels they're producing and so those companies To what their institutional vessels are telling them and and here we are. Stuart I wanna talk big picture here and help us understand where we are when it comes to the energy transition here because I I think that a lot of people this year might have learned kind of the hard way that we're not as far along when it comes to the energy transition as many people thought.

It's gonna be a lot harder to get debt investors interested in this deal than it was at that time. Does that give him an out? Technically I don't hear it does give him out technically or ignore some headlines crossing the Bloomberg sources have told me that that Sean Edgett who's chief legal council in Twitter is basically sent a memo star saying we are gonna move forward at $54. 20 a share please pair with us while we work out the legally as of all of this Generally council. As a newsroom on the tumultuous time at Twitter as a company ad and I'm wondering what you can bring us about what this means for you know employees there now that they're actually a certainty it's kind of a you know simple set 17 some sense mosque was Staff unhappy about some of the things he said in his behavior as we know in the exchange of text messages disclosed as part of discovery in the court filings paragraph the current Twitter CEO did not appreciate the negative things that must were saying about Twitter on Twitter Is a company they've been frozen Literally frozen hiring they've restructured to move resources to teams that they fought would fare better and they've not been able to enact real change other than the keen eye if you may have noticed that an edit button is in trial in markets like Canada Australia and New Zealand so you know A lot of them have been braced for this.

I mean, is it, is there a bottom line that at this point, Twitter is a bruised asset? Is that the expectations or not the expectations with the perception out there? Among bankers, among the street. I mean, how do they see this asset? So, ultimately, it's kinda academic at this point. It's to take private deal and if You'll go through $54. 20 to share existing shareholders got a pretty nice premium yeah and they must be bitely bite your hand off of that wouldn't they let's be honest what a great deal for shareholders mosque in the exchange of text messages reject Dorsey for example Twitter's co-founder that we found out as part of discovery they believe that really big changes in the in this platform and they felt that Anyways, it was if it was a private company.

We could retest those levels or go a little bit lower. So Range of the bottom closer to the bottom than not let's just put it that way but I do think in the short term we've we've got a little more rocky this coming our way this just feels really good the last couple of days but I'm not yet convinced of it okay so why do you say that we're probably we've seen the bottom or we're close to it that we're closer to it What metric out there says to you yep this is it.

We're talking maybe about, you know, rates, the peak happening early next year, You know, standing path. So, is there something in the fed conversation that also makes you think that too? Yeah I think they're you know some of the rhetoric as loosening up a tiny bit but you know I I I think one thing that you know one conclusion there are sort of come to is that you know the the is being very sort of strict and transparent with the language and and yes you know things could change we saw what happened in in the Hey but you know Jackson Hole I mean the message was we're going to Higher and and be you know he's essentially just indicating that he would be persistently hawkish the the whole fed team would be persistently hawkish and that you know it would be a mistake to kind of pump the bricks so you know my son's on all of this is there obviously seeing the same data we are they can't possibly be ignoring real inflation fall Maybe they'll be lower than expected they think that's when you know when we get the sale coming out actually saying okay now it's the appropriate time to pause or Rate is lower.

But if you look at these charts, you know, so since the 1950's when you've had 25% more pullbacks in the S and P 500, you know, a year or so out, 2 years out, 3 years out, you start seeing Hi double triple digit returns right so I do think that this is a great investor's market so investors looking with you know for a portfolio that they're planning on holding for 3 to 5 years you know even young people for one K dollar cost averages for however many years 40 50 years till they retire I mean these are sort of generational lifetime types of opportunities That can't be ignored.

They're copying eBay and other players in the US market and then what happens around 2014 is that there's real frontier innovation going on in China that is not happening here.

Alright, so what does this mean? You know, it's interesting how we talk so much about the US dollar, the dominance, the strength of it, what it's been, you know, the impact on the global world in this current macro environment. How does something like the cashless revolution maybe diminish The respect that the US dollar has garnered for for so long. What's really interesting is that despite the incredible strength and revolutionary capability that China sent text firms have had in China they've had relatively limited sex sex abroad at disrupting The current dominance of US financial firms.

Well, it is interesting when you look at like the emerging markets overall you know, how they have been adopting in many ways, financial innovation, much more quickly and more readily because they don't have the financial infrastructure that the developed world has.

Hi Emily checking San Francisco and this is Bloomberg technology coming up in the next hour Elon Musk changes his mind again saying he will buy Twitter after all at the original price the Bloomberg Scoop sends Twitter share soaring and Tesla shares falling Why the change of harp after spending And a lawyer trying to get out of the deal To buy a company he's now criticized for months we'll take Twitter just drop it soon or try to get Tesla in SpaceX ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,468,2022-10-04 21:05:26

We'll ask those questions throughout this hour. But first I wanna start with the market reaction Bloomberg's at blood law has been across this all day in New York. Add walk us through the ups and the downs. Yeah so I mean Twitter shares surge right the most since April 4 which was the day when Mosque first discloses In Twitter. Let alone before he announced that he would try to buy the company and take it private. Ultimately, we ended up we gained a 22%. The stock was halted at one Point for volatility and then resume trading and by that point muscular updated is thirteenD filing to let us know what go it was going on in a Twitter spokesman had spoken as well let's take a look Terminal chart which is the spread right the difference between the $54. 20 per share price and the current share price and now it's off the chart right we're really closing that Something that we expect to happen quite quickly. All of the conditions of the original April 25 agreement have largely been satisfied and that is what Thought it's about in his letter to Twitter that was disclosed on Tuesday he is going with the original terms of the deal you also mentioned test that we did After that Bloombow scoop closing up by around three% I think what's interesting here is that the feeling in the market is mosque will at some point have to ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,757,2022-10-04 21:06:32
11355,"To the closing and the conditions and a lot of those conditions are now met shareholder approval from Twitter regularly waiting periods of surpassed so it could be interested to see how quickly Closing of this deal proceeds and his courts gonna go through some of the reporting I think Kathleen Saint Jude McCormick the chance to read judge who was due to preside over the trial in October she's basically saying How is this gonna go moving forward? Right she said come back to us with a proposal okay add thank you we're gonna talk to you a little bit later in the show it all started with a Bloomberg scoop Bloomberg obtaining a letter from Elon Mosque's team stating that he wants Go ahead and buy Twitter after all for the original price. $54. 20 a share. Let's get right to Bloomworks Court Wagner who helped break this story as well as group of Kawasaki president and CEO Ross Gerber who Tesla. But sold his steak in Twitter over the course of all this current. I wanna start with you. What is the very, very latest that we know? Yeah I mean you and Ed were kinda hitting on it right obviously Elon Musk is saying hey let's get back to this original deal that we had in April Twitter has said hey we want to close this at 54 20 per share which is what they've been saying all along now you would think okay both sides are at the exact same spot right that was the agreement that was in April Now the fact that there is a little bit of reservation here or hesitation just goes to show how much distrust has you know come up between these two sides over this process right so the fact that both of them are saying they want the Same thing on the same day and yet people are still waiting to say well let's wait until it's officially signed on the dotted line they just kinda give you a sense of how this is played out that that One is gonna hold their breath until this becomes final We may find out in the next couple days.

Now, the fact that there is a little bit of reservation here or hesitation Just goes to show how much distrust has you know come up between these two sides over this process right so the fact that both of them are saying they want the exact same thing on the same day and yet people are still waiting to say well let's wait until the it's officially signed on the dotted line they're just kinda give you a sense Everyone is gonna hold their breath until this becomes final We may find out in the next couple days. Right and who can blame them? Right? As a Tesla investor, Ross, you weren't happy about Elon Musk trying to buy Twitter at all. You got out of Twitter. What do you think in now? I'm thinking it's gonna make the business books on how not to buy a company He's literally created a huge loss for himself by really the way he's handled this because a lot has changed inside Twitter in the last 4 months as well including mass amount of high quality individuals who worked at Twitter leaving and a lot more planning on So, he's paying the highest price possible. He's trying to get dead at the worst time possible. He's basically Forced to buy this company it's not like he changed a heart I think his lawyers just told him he was gonna lose and so this is what I thought the whole time and I got out of this mess because I didn't wanna be involved with this mess and I'm grateful I did I lost a little money but but this is a mess It's really, you're not great for Elon. That said, I'm glad that it's gonna come to a conclusion and and hopefully, as a Tesla investor, we can get back to focusing on the most exciting company in the world.

Right and then you know from many perspective Twitters in a worse position than it was when Elon Musk decided to buy the company because of what's happened What's happened with folks leaving the company on the Tesla side Ross you know clearly investors are concerned about this given the reaction in the stock you do believe the concern is more that he might sell Tesla's stock to finance this deal or the keyman risk that his Are gonna be even more divided. So, you know, from the perspective of Tasla, he sold a lot of stock already and it's been an overhang all year from those sales and if he has to sell, you know, another couple one 1 billion, it's a huge company and and that'll So it takes away that uncertainty either way I don't think it's that material from an economic perspective but I think the second issue brought up is material which is being CEO of three major companies is not something humans can do well So I get that he thinks he can do this but this is now a media property which is very different than running a space or EV which are both technology companies and and the dynamics could takes to run Company is completely opposite from his skill set and that's been more than proven by the way he's handled the employees on Twitter like it all hands meeting and I think you guys are being nice saying that there's distrust it's not distressed it's hate a hate him ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&ab_channel=NASA,470,2022-10-04 21:14:03

And the reality is Kurt Let me know if I'm right here. I mean, anyone must put on Twitter in a matter of days, right? This could all happen really quickly. That's right Well all of the the Populations for the deal closing have have already happened Including the shareholder vote which we, you know, covered last in September, last month, and so, you know, yes, this could all happen very quickly.

This is Been talking about for like years that there needs to be a strong number to it at Tasla and there needs to be AA deeper management bass bench in Tesla tells me all the time how great all these young people are which I agree but I'm like you need to promote these people and you need to show and Give these people some power over the business because the perception right now is exactly what you're saying is now the sky runs three public companies and and different industries like once again I don't think that's possible so something's gotta give and you know hopefully it's not Tasla that's for sure And Kurt what 4 weeks away from An election. You know, how are folks at Twitter thinking about this? If this does happen, right? In a matter of days. Yup. The election is 4 weeks away. Yeah and Elon has said repeatedly he doesn't you know agree with a lot of Twitter policies he doesn't necessarily think their nest necessary right these are the things that have been kind of implemented over years right over Basketball election cycles and you know the big one of course is he said he would bring back president Donald Trump on the Twitter if if he was owning the company right and there is a chance that all those different things could come you know into play over these next couple weeks and to lead up to to the US midterms and and you know not even looking ahead To whatever happens in 2024.

I I think in many ways this is almost the most expected outcome of all which is settling on the eve of Traditional sort of settlement.

I mean, the price is the same. Yeah i mean i think the idea must be something like Twitter already took a shareholder votes. The to go back to the shareholders and ask them to It would be time consuming it would be embarrassing Twitter would have to explain why it was doing this when in fact it's in very strong legal position and if the goal here is to stop the proceedings in court there might not have been enough time maybe trial was supposed to start in 2 weeks getting the papers Very possibly not get the goal of stopping the Delaware proceedings from going So that is ultimately likely at least part of Musk's thinking in terms of not even Further to get a couple of dollars off the price Interesting. So, walk us through how this Likely play out in court because if you're Twitter, you're wanting to get some certainty that he really means it this time. He threw in some language about dead financing and a condition and I'm sure that's making the Twitter folk say, hey, what is he? Mean by this? Could they still go to a judge and ask the judge To somehow you know be part of the agreement or somehow further enforce an agreement ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,761,2022-10-04 21:24:05

Twitter is, you know, especially just that this is some kind of game by mask to delay things. I'm there. They don't wanna let that happen. And if he is in actually trying to place a kind of game, then, obviously, but still Twitter needs things can probably happen very quickly after that Companies already gotten a regulatory approvals in the sharehold That it needs to close. So, it's really just a matter of getting the financing and that probably won't be very long. So, yes, I think that this could Close Soon and With the trial date will will be suspended that there won't be a trial. I think that's So after let's say that happens Moscow's Twitter You know, we're a few weeks out from an election. What happens? You know, how quickly could he just start making changes? Hey, I mean, you know, he's in charge of the company. He can make whatever changes he wants, I suppose Orders it. The question is whether he really does want to. I mean, I think part of the reason that he may have gotten full feet about the whole deal was because he didn't necessarily wanna take responsibility All of that and I don't know if he wants to thrust himself into that kind of political spotlight right away but I mean, you know, once it is his company, he can order what he wants.

So, Twitter was the last remaining independent top 10 worldwide internet property That's gotta be the one thing that they're in their heart to hearts tell themselves this is why this thing is worth 44 1 billion dollars because there's a lot more ways that we're gonna be able to extract value from it beyond just advertising so advertising is likely to look reasonably healthy in the fourth quarter you've got the midterms coming up in a Political reporters are always pretty good for digital advertisers and they also may have heard that Twitter's numbers were improving and must want to get ahead of that as well.

I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know I saw Elon and he landed his falcon X rock in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger I thought wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars And if he's going out the pieces going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I wanna be the one to build it.

Three One. Kennedy Space Center Humans have now been Living and working in space More than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small, but the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people. That seems Be the dividing line between where we were before and where we wanna be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit At the very deepest level is about survival or species. So, I get pretty excited when I spin a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do cuz this really is the first step to learning to live, live off the planet. That first step is just to start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space.

While commercial companies may be stepping into imagine what these new space habitats look like is what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialization. On the next episode of giant leap we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on earth Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to threeD print full human organs But before lowerth or a bit can become a new industrial center we're going to need to take another giant leap ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,793,2022-10-04 23:44:03

As of 2019 Millennials of all stripes owned only five% of US housing compared with 15% for gen Xers Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did.
