13746," When I was twenty-four years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on T-shirt. And I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill and then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. The word of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent in mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken in two places I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor I'm in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball. I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice when my eye caved in. I was falling my own blood. I knew don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. This way would be another box which ked",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1972,2022-10-12 00:00:15
13747," and his brother Frank Vertita, UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show the Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, people throwing shoes, a guy coming to the oxagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show the Ultimate Fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realized this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of it. UFC Family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time and UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one side, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of strike force Scott Coker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when strike force was bought out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1973,2022-10-12 00:04:26
13748," It is said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later I'm killed stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul over the law by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here if you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. We have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters, Kung Lee, Nate Corey and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me and says, hey, come, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1974,2022-10-12 00:08:41
13749," through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talk to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting, I could tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached garage the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a boutser and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all, that a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle, it's been driven by Rannick Tours, it's been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and they walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is and if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1975,2022-10-12 00:13:07
13750," how he planned a rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son's about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. You know, we're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made. Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls in under territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around 150 trillion dollars. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. Problem is that the southern Indian ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's neanderings channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1976,2022-10-12 00:17:21
13751," us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map, and you can see some shape of the sea floor. But most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched Sea Bed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean-wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean, do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. LAUGHTER Since Sea Bed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data. And it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then, again, feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope, known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82-meter-long research vessel, equipped with two multi-beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope, with some knots, to sonar acoustics. That is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and the measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam sonar, and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor, and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time, and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor. And that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across, and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows, and create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam. And if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, so think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1977,2022-10-12 00:22:03
13752," Think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the seafloor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the seafloor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operated vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate seabed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the seafloor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it. And so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of, let's say Hawaii or some place where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But, I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology. But it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. And it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge insights as we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roots.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1978,2022-10-12 00:26:08
13753," Up-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm babe to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just the company behind these chicken nuggets style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity and biodiversity. Taking a bulldozer to them and planting soil in corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing? To have dinner that tastes good, it does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we certainly need, if you will, an end game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy for instance, being mercy cells in a liquid broth that contains...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1979,2022-10-12 00:30:29
13754," You can sell from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we merge these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat, so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation, so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product needs our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup, Memphis Meets, has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck. So we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they meet. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens. But there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest in to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed, raises, or drops of price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that, and hammering on those things of the course of the next five, 10, 15 years. We'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here's a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually, and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sarah DeBrin, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1980,2022-10-12 00:34:57
13755," food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called Artificial Meat, the realest fakeest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when Impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible Foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astounded to my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth, and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So, him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minnicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Pat and his colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Bum with Fuku, and they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger, and then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. This tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's like a burger. It tastes like... Yuckers. The foam is the world's real eggs. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like white castle, and then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1981,2022-10-12 00:42:13
13756," The funding round in March value the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. Time now for the stock of the hour. And that is beyond meat shares of the faux meat or plant based protein company are soaring today. Beyond meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. Right. We won't do that. Beyond meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal based industry. Rivals or not impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They're a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns. Although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know, what's up, do I think? It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything like that. That's very, very much. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1982,2022-10-12 00:46:35
13757," What are a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It sits very close to Iran actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been a very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go, because it is contested in the region, because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We had seen this movie before, an outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China, Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan and it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to G.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1983,2022-10-12 00:50:49
13758," And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers are brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity, they speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. It actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer. Concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port. And they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative. But five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births. And all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes. And a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense. If eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost a sort of forward-based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19-kilometer highway linking the port with the Macran Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who lived there and worked there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1984,2022-10-12 00:55:18
13759," Most of the people who lived there and worked there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that they express highway from the port was originally proposed, would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalists spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadal. They're not a least economic prosperity, but they're a least the development that leaves them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefit. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they were an extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI fling down. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun?

13760," Where's my gun? Change, keep it steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This was a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs. And these two guys, Marchin-Evinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Balder's Gate, which is the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher Book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Greta became this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. And in 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. Really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good, and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced, and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted, and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a hype.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1986,2022-10-12 01:03:51
13761," Belovved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go on to an over 250 game of the year awards, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt, who is also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014, The Witcher and The Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the Game Award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro-transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious, you know, one to do this with EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2, they got really aggressive on micro-transactions in a game that already cost at least $60.00. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times, and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff, and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this was a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers, and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 Trade Show. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else we could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay are about to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1987,2022-10-12 01:08:09
13762," The project reds upcoming title Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Holy f***. This if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to jump in. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by the STEMOa 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really, really important to them. So it was really important that they make the STEMO blow people away, which it did, but that might have come to the cause of some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise. Whoa, no way! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up and up to the right. Pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the Polish stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt stock was at a tie, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the scenes, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic. The direction keeps changing. Things are floundering. We're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews of more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity. So as not to risk their careers, CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews for this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an email.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1988,2022-10-12 01:12:45
13763," CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or they said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch is per their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games, and that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which is that this game wasn't going to call us. Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Sony Pictures attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars from multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1989,2022-10-12 01:16:47
13764," There was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News. I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China, to hack through the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s, with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding, was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime, and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane, where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers, he understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under impression pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1000 IP addresses in North Korea available, and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. Performally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1990,2022-10-12 01:21:07
13765," Don't create the noise, engaging and hacking, and describe some accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at an university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China, because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus and then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free, actually, by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. There are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without users on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year. And he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of that money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Kim Yang. About the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out. What he heard about North Korea, when he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1991,2022-10-12 01:25:35
13766," One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. The wind is the wind, the wind is the wind of the time, the wind of the time, the wind of the time. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company. Ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And one day realized that there was a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. That little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. That's when I realized that there was a big problem. I was able to find a place where they could just settle down. I was able to find a place where they could just settle down.

13767," MUSIC Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, and the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jcpiny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Those anchors bring in all those people. They tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off. That's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1993,2022-10-12 01:34:14
13768," It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores, that were department stores. So you had JC Penny and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbrier had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbrier then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middling malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middling mall survive? That's their next strategy. Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb and house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACS that they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that NACS is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been keyed to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. That thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1994,2022-10-12 01:38:27
13769," Another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the king of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID? And what is it now in a post COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics firm Green Street advisors, which rates American malls from eight a deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls. We grade a minus or better. The DNC quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count. We think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, a malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high end. So I'm talking about bowel harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property. So their sales per square foot are really high. But also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that, frankly, we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1995,2022-10-12 01:42:56
13770,". President Trump traveled to Utah today, where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the cases still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active. It changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money but by doing the right thing it always ends up making more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I will delinquate because you know they're saying you know this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course like every other teenage kid I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate of Von Sean Arts first business, Schuwanart Equipment which made in soul climbing supplies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1996,2022-10-12 01:47:18
13771," Patagonia was born out of Rockclimate Avantian art's first business, Schuwenart Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Avantian art was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Avantian art is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Avantian art and four friends, including Dag Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the Samiti where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff or their employees were cared for in many ways. Not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schuannard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things different. And we were going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuwenard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in time languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain it all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1997,2022-10-12 01:51:33
13772," term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time, Seanard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypercritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypercritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Best fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Devana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. Right now, Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. This all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. What's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years, revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including Adventure Capital Fund for environmental causes and sustainable food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagonci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active. For instance, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office and that's because of the image that the brand projects and so they have to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1998,2022-10-12 01:55:49
13773," and finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And so they have to be with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt? And the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1999,2022-10-12 02:01:28

13775," and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO's Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well, I love seeing it work in Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well and I just wanted that next chapter. My view in my career, I've always been focused on kind of continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience and I love it. It's the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here and what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your long term decline and I learned that really early on in my career now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things by definition everything can succeed and so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working I would say one of two things are wrong either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're going to get there. So to me a really natural part, you know kind of a sister organization to investing for long term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together actually and so I find the narrative it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking they go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and so you know that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2001,2022-10-12 02:08:59
13776," And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hang calls at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. This comment was be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume, you know what we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life, is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation, its organic growth, and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2002,2022-10-12 02:13:18
13777," think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas. So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation. And I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business, that's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where is a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison, well provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There also a whole host of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2003,2022-10-12 02:17:45
13778," requirements like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell them like if I have to head to a parent's teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss you don't tell your boss you've got to get over the guilt. You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers but for many more cancers. That gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable get the best care and just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years but for anybody out there and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color and sometimes one is larger than the other and what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2004,2022-10-12 02:21:54
13779," I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt, especially in this new work world? I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? OK. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career, because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt. And when on the other side, mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And I'll never forget during the financial crisis, at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG. And my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside, because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have, and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm working on it? You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we do? So I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize, I'm a professional. I do things when I can. And it makes sense. And I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, OK, that's step one. I've got five steps. Turnie, do not tell your boss. You're tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it. But I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? Huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want? And how do they want to work? And how do they want to live their lives? So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have, to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? Are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over a years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2005,2022-10-12 02:26:38
13780," That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you guys for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say I don't want to get to the growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So, when they made the announcement about the role of change, they really, they were very serious about moving to this board role and they've been, they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever, whenever. But most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level and spend great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like? I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then, 10 years from now? It's fascinating to, I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it is video going to be the first, the way they understand it's going to be about, you know, search is going to be a different type of experience so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Like, where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth. Like, what you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? There's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Thank you, Paulette. Thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2006,2022-10-12 02:30:19
13781," Music Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. Of course. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in? Yeah. I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. Is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it. And thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go when you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Ford and raised in India. Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college. Just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate, our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshot as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, Cloud, or hardware products, Google Play. We're building a diverse set of businesses, but underlying all of the investments we are making in AI, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-ad tracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? They look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge. I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people every day when people come to Google. They place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. When we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. That's what motivates us to make sure we privacy, we security, we trust.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2007,2022-10-12 02:35:17
13782," once maybe under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent, and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, we were exposed to a set of concerns. We invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, and so on. Technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing, ambient computing, AR. And we are in. Is that count as the metaverse? Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And you know, but I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet. All of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give, you know, agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we're giving, the strength of our company is we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We've got to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2008,2022-10-12 02:39:15
13783," of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. How to create a new world. How to create a new world. How to create a new world. How to create a new world. You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had 100-year flood, which was an extremely extreme event. I kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. I think it's the most defining issue we all face and definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? Encourage by many things, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You have to keep the economy growing. It really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. We have to get some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. We are now pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24-7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. In 2019.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2009,2022-10-12 02:43:46
13784," To be 24, 7 carbon free, that means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So, part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year and seeing a poor. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fitting timeframe. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends, which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So, many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies there are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So, a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So, super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so, I think it will transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. So, what will the past few years be beginning to build things there and some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce when you look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, I was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US China Agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So, I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so, I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So, I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing. You know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there will be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere and so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted. You can do it. So, over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And, you know, those are all ways it's going to be-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2010,2022-10-12 02:47:52
13785," you can do it. So over time you will expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world and you know those are always it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll you know we'll see the effects of that. You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns, there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and any time we you're developing technology there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways I'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within Google you know people think about it deeply, we publish a lot of research there are I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it's it'll it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic, what did you start? The cooking pizza is learning cook which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better. you have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me you know it was a moment I think it changed the company for the better you know we've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments and the biggest you know overall and diversity and inclusion I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals but it forced us to think about new answers. So for example you know tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem but we are now going to places where the talent is we are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2011,2022-10-12 02:52:03
13786," the talentists. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York, that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay, I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in, people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. There are, I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big, big system. And, you know, I think I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right, that's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? You know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning the cup, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football. Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make any clues. Okay. Squid game or Ted Lasso. I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Scoot Games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids. A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games. It's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and and you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? I mean, I think it's a lot. Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of abs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what would I need? A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing, but sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's that advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, and some decisions weigh on me. But it's a privilege.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2012,2022-10-12 02:56:41
13787," On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and you know, in some decisions way on me and but it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through so I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar. Sundar Patai, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Emily. Pleasure to be here. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2013,2022-10-12 03:01:19
13788," POISOUR.............. Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking and the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And the next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was principally with Andy, of course, was new the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that's a breaking strong with your hard toys.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2014,2022-10-12 03:05:32
13789," I'm hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent-sized business when I left, but it's really grown. And the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s. And I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it. But of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess, I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes. And Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had start before other companies really started to take this seriously, was in a norm. Frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with kind of a pilot books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing in a deep way on the product you're building and in a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden, you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, um.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2015,2022-10-12 03:09:54
13790," But it's easy to say it, but it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, I mean, this is a very large market segment. And if you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge and we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy is going to be a big success. And the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? Yeah, I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff, or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we, it's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume, but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff, because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2016,2022-10-12 03:13:42
13791," I don't want to presume, but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff, because you know, Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and will having operated that business for so long. And I expect that'll also give him an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years, we'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. And right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate. And so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon, and so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name as three? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, the business grew, but Jeff was always available when we needed him, and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? What do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff is very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very important, and I think he's been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have, and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond, and just to make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business, and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. DERNA is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iose, but it's been an absolute privilege to for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving and they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2017,2022-10-12 03:19:15
13792," all the way to manufacturing, with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end, and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on. To Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going, and at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values, and that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are no where close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. I think it's going to be a big bet. I think it's going to be a big bet. I think it's going to be a big bet. I think it's going to be a big bet. I think it's going to be a big bet. I think it's going to be a big bet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2018,2022-10-12 03:22:34
13793," to AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information? Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers' data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers' data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is ready today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide. And Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the backend servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? I think the metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with invention. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we're, we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2019,2022-10-12 03:26:59
13794," I got 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? I think we're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. Partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing. And we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

13795," Uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators, and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been, and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera, and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while, and in technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And I mean, overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. We've invested a lot in responsibility, and that's been a really big focus for us. And with weather through a pandemic, and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the mean way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main value of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like, super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2021,2022-10-12 03:35:44
13796," a lot of jobs. So we actually see like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators, but now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like, and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But, you know, because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, you know, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is within, with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are, like our own metrics, like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2022,2022-10-12 03:40:04
13797," and Today's your big day are you excited? Mama is tired. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, you two must become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that has really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally and how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing and I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. But should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? Do you remember that we were starting with the words that have made micro control",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2023,2022-10-12 03:44:55
13798," What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube almost always they's home about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube and during the pandemic we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the home schooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see and that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids. Which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family and you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on on teen users? The influence it might have on on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. Even letting parents just say these are like the 10 videos my kid can only see these 10 videos and so that is that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2024,2022-10-12 03:48:47
13799," doctor appears. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important. I am of leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders, that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. Yeah. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that were is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the requests? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2025,2022-10-12 03:53:08
13800," Why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do go a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And you know, if I were ever asked to testify, I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids. And you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are like the most important things to do, then, you know, you're going to get there faster. Lauren, started. Have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't at release and things that we don't aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects or I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sender's doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, some pesdairi casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three three creators and like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology that has been just a personal...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2026,2022-10-12 03:57:33

That has been just a personal goal of mine, is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have and I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you like to have your two? Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 33 million people have been affected by this flooding and the pollution. Disruption is the whole point of a strike.

13802," Slide converges air ㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅋ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East, our top story is this morning. Andrew Bailey, a rattle's market as he wards funds they have until the end of this week to wind up positions they can't maintain for the Bank of England halted support. Cleveland Fed President, LaReta Mester, tells Bloomberg that officials need to keep raising interest rates in order to quail surging inflation. Right now the funds rate is just approaching a neutral of funds rate and we really need to get it above neutral for a time if we want to put inflation on the downer path. President Biden voices his fury with Saudi Arabia over all of the OPEC plus oil production cuts accusing the Kingdom of Allying itself with Russia and vowing to punish Rhea. And we hear from Kathy Wood as her flagship ETF hits lows reached during the depths of the pandemic after falling 62% so far this year. It's just gone 80 AM across the Emirates. I'm Yusuf Gimelladine in Dubai. The stock slump deepens here to date on the benchmark. S&P 500 we're down about a quarter. We're down 25% so far this year on the mini futures. It's a little bit of a reprieve up about a fifth of 1% looking here at US 10 year yields. 393.47 Morgan Stanley out with a very detailed note saying look the treasury market size is a distraction. It's all about Fed expectations when it comes to pricing. The Bloomberg dollar index gets a lift. Again, we have PPI in the US in the next few hours. It's going to be a bit of an appetizer for CPI Thursday and then Brent Crude as a short of $94 a barrel down for a third day with slow down concerns coming to the fore. I want to get to the graphic of the moment. That is an intraday chart over the last two days actually of the cable trade with the governor of the bank of England triggering a pound sell off this pledge to end the support. They're going to be out by the end of the week. The pound is falling back through 110 versus $1. It's for the first time since September 29 and the week a pound is going to be the safety valve for a lot of these UK assets as the UK treasury and the Bank of England work together to try and get policy on the same page. Well, easier said than done. See if we go for our clients. Just in terms of the work that's been done and how much we've already given back on that. The guilt market is going through some brutal moves. The credibility of the bank is on the line. And while they've said they're going to end support on Friday, we had this lobby group representing UK pension funds diverge the governor to extend the program until the end of the month. So far, the market has been functional. Yeah, yields are coming back up, but it's functional. The full picture is yet to emerge because guilt trading had been closed prior to the comments from the Bank of England governor. Well, let's see how the markets are getting erratalled or how they're holding up in other parts. So, Vagia, Julie, it's Sally has all the different nuances for our Singapore studio. Hey, Jules. If rattle is probably right, you do have Asian stocks lower for a fourth session. We are seeing just a modest decline in Japan because you have a very weak yen. The yen back again at those levels that spurred intervention. Will we see further intervention on that yen at that 24 year low? Also we are watching, of course, this sell down continue in the tech players. And that's very much going through into the Hangseung index. It is at a decade low. The Hangseung tech index at July 2016 levels. And China markets coming under pressure to the CSI 300 on the lunch break down by 1.4%. That's a six month low little support seen from aggregate financing and also new one loans data. We did have the one fix a 30th day of a stronger than expected fix. Looking at the cost be pretty flat there, but of course it is all about the movement in the one two after the Bank of Korea raised interest rates by 50 basis points. This is only the second.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2028,2022-10-12 04:06:16
13803," longer than expected fix. Looking at the cost be pretty flat there, but of course it is all about the movement in the one two. After the Bank of Korea raised interest rates by 50 basis points, look, this is only the second time that we have actually seen a rate hike this large, if we have a look at my GTV chart. We heard, of course, that there was some descent coming through from some of the board members, two did not expect to see a 50 basis point hike, two in fact, suggesting that we only needed to see a 25 basis point hike, but the Bank of Korea governor re-saying that the effects depreciation that week you won, excuse me, one of the major reasons for the decisions and multiple B.O.K members seeing the terminal rate peaking at 3.5%. So yet another jumbo hike coming through from a central bank here in Asia, you sir. Yeah, an eventful afternoon in South Korea for sure, especially given that we had what three red headlines. So, thank you for that. That's Julia Tsali. Let's get to the Bank of England again, because the governor Andrew Bailey has warned fund managers that they have until the end of this week to wind up positions that they can maintain before the central bank halts its market support. He says the temporary intervention is going to end on Friday, and even though we had these calls, I mentioned this at the top of the show, from a lobby group to extend the program. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done, and my message to the funds involved, and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now, you've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. The comments rattle broader markets, triggering a sell-off in the pound, and also pulling down the US stocks. For more, let's bring in blue brooks and the current. I mean, and the Bank of England reasserting its commitment to winding this down in the next few days, but maybe based off the price action later in the week, they might have to turn ship again if market functioning is at risk. Well, there is a lot to consider in this use of, as you mentioned, on the one hand, of course, the bank is confirming what it already said, which is its intervention would end at the end of this week. But results are showing it a gone down to those market participants that they've got to sort out their trading books and get their positions in order because the bank isn't going to be there to support them when it comes to these collateral calls that have upset, of course, UK bond market. Now, the market response has been very volatile, like you say, and a lot of market participants are responding by saying they're not quite sure of A, it's possible for these positions to be on the mound. That's certainly the view of the lobby group. They're calling for more time. But also, of course, other market makers are saying that the price action on this is going to force a bank's hand anyway, that the bank will have to probably announce some kind of extender measures in some form or another. And then you're getting to a whole discussion about the bank of any credibility. It's already been significant damage to the UK fiscal credibility. If the bank of any of any of you get this call wrong, the market participants are saying this morning, it will be very damaging to the monetary policy side of things as well. So certainly a very high stakes game, markets reacting very negatively. And obviously, the coming days are going to be crucial for this UK story, which is obviously spilling over globally as well. And meanwhile, we had the Cleveland Fed president, LaRetta Mester, she told Bloomberg that officials need to keep raising interest rates in order to quell surging inflation. The real issue is we need to do more. We have not seen inflation move back down. And we need to see that because leaving inflation where it is, it continues. There's a higher chance that it does become embedded in the economy. So, Ainda, what is your initial analysis then on this latest bit of rhetoric? Well, there was no hint of a dovish sort of pivot at all from its master. Some of the fed officials in recent days have kind of flagged areas of concern, but these remarks that our colleagues focused on from its master really focused on the point that she thinks they have to go ahead with shrinking the balance sheet as planned. No need to slow that up, given despite, of course, the broader market volatility. And on inflation, Ms. Mester has made the point that it's better to do too much than too little. So she certainly sees the case for more rate hikes and she's not yet convinced inflation is heading in the direction that it should be. So, it was a very hawkish comment. It will, of course, meant those views for that big 75-base point hike at the start of the next month. Ms. Mester herself, she's a voting member of the Fed this year. So, I think, despite those comments, we had from those other officials earlier this week about global concerns and maybe...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2029,2022-10-12 04:10:44
13804," The start of next month is Ms. Messer herself. She's a voting member of the Fed this year. So I think, you know, despite those comments we had from those other officials earlier this week about global concerns and maybe even keeping on the data as they go forward, this certainly puts the ball back I think in the Hawkes court. And thanks a lot, truly appreciated that's the endocorrent in Hong Kong. I want to get to President Biden now, because he has voiced his fury with Sony Arabia over OPEC plus oil production cuts. He spoke to CNN. There's going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia. What kind of consequences? Menendez says suspend all arms sales. Is that something you'd consider? I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I'm having mine, but there will be the will be consequences. Let's get more with our energy reporter, Steve at Stopchinsky. I mean, Stephen, we've seen threats from the US in the past to try and push the Saudis into a certain corner. I'm thinking here of Jamal Kashoggi, but there was a less meat than a lot of the rhetoric suggested. What could come through here? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, when you look at what he's actually saying, what Biden says, his exact words are, they're still considering, and they're evaluating what they're going to do. Now, here on out, they're going to be talking to policymakers on the hill. They're going to try to figure out a strategy to hit Saudi Arabia, but also, they have to remember that any action, whether it's tangible against Saudi Arabia, whether it's banning arms sales for one year, which is what some policymakers are suggesting in the US, if that does go through, what's the retaliation from Saudi Arabia? What's the tit for a tat with OPEC Plus? Those are things that they have to weigh, especially since any more action from OPEC Plus, if this is targeted at helping Russia, and if the US does get in the middle of this, do they risk any potential future cuts to also counteract anything that the United States does? It's a difficult balancing act, but the fact of the matter is, oil prices are elevated. They've fallen the last few days, but they are elevated from lows last month. And that is going to add more pressure on gasoline prices raising that, and that's also going to put pressure on the Biden administration and his allies during the midterm election. There are a lot of things that they have to consider, and it's not going to be an easy discussion. Stephen, thank you very much for that. A great to reflect on some of those developments that's as serious as Chitsky and Singapore. I want to reflect on something else that's happening in the markets, a little bit of a pop in upside-stranks for the British pound. This is, as a result of a headline from the Financial Times, the Bank of England has apparently signaled privately to bankers that it may extend the bond buying program. At the moment, we are up by three tenths of 1%. Several bankers who have been briefed by the Bank of England, the article goes to say, that officials are watching, what are the so-called liabilities-driven investment managers, which of course helped the pension funds manage a risk, have been able to build enough cash, in terms of reserves to enable clients to meet margin calls. So if this article is anything to go by, the approach to the Bank of England is still going to be very much calibrated, and with a lot of feedback from some of the stakeholders and the actual people with skin in the game, as we count down to the deadline that the Bank of England has set for now. Are they going to roll back on that? That is what the market is going to try and discover over the next few hours. Let's check in on the first word headline for you as well, from around the world and get out to Simone Foxman and Doha. Simone. The morning usage of the UK is reportedly set to declare China as an official threat. According to the Sun, Prime Minister Liz Truss is preparing to toughen the government stance against China. After she released a strategic review of its policy towards Beijing last month, on Tuesday, the UK spy chief warned that China's leadership is seeking to use technology to tighten its grip over its citizens and spread influence abroad. Israel and Lebanon have reached an agreement to settle a maritime border dispute in a gas-rich part of the Mediterranean Sea. The deal will allow Israel to begin extracting natural gas from the offshore carish field, without the threat of attack by his Bula. The US broker, Deel, could also pave the way for both countries to ramp up offshore gas production, including Israeli exports to Europe.

13805," Israeli exports to Europe. Elon Musk has denied that he spoke directly with Vladimir Putin about Ukraine. Musk was refuting a tweet from Ian Bremer, the head of risk-political risk-consultant Eurasia Group, who wrote in a client note that Musk told him about the alleged conversation with the Russian President. Bremer says the talk came before Musk sent a series of tweets urging Ukraine to seed Crimea to Russia for good. Musk tweeted that he has only spoken to Putin once, 18 months ago, and their discussion was about space. Speaking of space, NASA has successfully changed the path of an asteroid, in what the Space Agency is calling a watershed moment for planetary defense and humanity. The refrigerator-sized dart probe slammed into a 160-meter-wide asteroid two weeks ago to determine whether its trajectory could be altered. NASA has released data showing the asteroid moved far more than anticipated, raising hopes that potentially devastating asteroid strikes on Earth can be prevented.

Thank you, Simone. Let's get you. It's over snapshot data. What else is still to come in the pipeline? We're going to cover the regional markets with the mind-investment we're going to do, who sees relatively resilient golf stocks compared to global peers. But at first, equity sell-off is more warnings about the economy emerge. We're going to get the outlook from them, and with these Maurice Gravier, this is Bloomberg. Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software is coming to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it, because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. It's about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? We really remind ourselves of how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the UN, we did see some pressure on the future. That is now being over. The economy is starting to go through the windshield. The financial system is starting to go through the windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. It didn't need to be this. This is the tragedy of it, John. It didn't need to be this way. This is a self-inflicted wound by central banks. This is going to be a reminder a little bit of October 2008 when people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. The moment I'm in the area with his thoughts on what such bankers are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2031,2022-10-12 04:18:52
13806," When people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. Mohammed Alarion with his thoughts on what such bankers are doing to markets and the economy. The risk of version has boosted the dollar and sent the end past levels that previously triggered intervention. Let's bring him to risk. To see I.O. for wealth management at Emirates and BD. I mean, much of the commentary from Mohammed Alarion are really in encapsulation of the year-to-date collateral damage that's been done. What does the Fed need to do now to maybe salvage what it can in terms of economic growth? Well, I think that as you just mentioned, interestingly, some damage has already been inflicted. I'm not sure that we are in October 2000 in ages before the collapse because we're already down pretty much 30% on everything. I think that the Fed has no other choice than to tighten because it's a slow moving shock. There is no quick fix. We were used to have quick fixes before and with having central banks fixing any market concern, now it's the opposite. Frankly, they have to avoid this price and wedge spiral in the US. The job market is two hot inflation sources are different in other parts of the world, but in the US, that's what they have to do. They have to tighten. I think they are right. Just in terms of some of the indicators that the Fed is going to be launching, one of those jobs indicator. It's going to get to very sternly, of course, the one that would bill you in here is thought. Take a listen. But it means people can't move. If you have fixed rate mortgage and it's a 3%, you're not going to move to a new house with a 7% mortgage. You're going to be stuck, which is why new home sales are plummeting. I also think people are nervous, should be nervous about their jobs. So jobs at the forefront, then I look at the latest intel announcement. They're going to be cutting thousands of jobs as well on the face of a PC slump, I think back to some of the other companies who have already had, even though we're just beginning the quarterly earnings season. At what point is there enough pain on the job side for the Fed to shift, either in rhetoric or in policy? Yeah, that's definitely a very important question. Again, I would like to highlight the fact that the starting point is one of the best job markets ever in the US and the unemployment rate is extremely low. So yeah, probably we have to go to, I don't know, 4, 4,500% to CDM and being really destroyed or at least cooled down. And then the Fed will be able to pivot and it should happen, I don't know, somewhere at the middle of 2023. If you have a 4, or 4,500% unemployment rate, you're not in a deep recession. You know, it's something that, of course, it's painful for people who lose their job and no doubt having said that, it's better than this wedge-spiral inflation that would inflict damages for decades. So let's say that 4, 4,500%, maybe second part of the mixture. Yeah, but what does your thing politically? It's an easier sell to have a functioning job market than anything normal in terms of price action in CPI. I think with that in mind, I look at what you've been doing or you've been telling clients, you've gone a little bit into government bonds. Why is it more attractive than stocks for you at the moment? Well, our view is that we expect extreme volatility to continue until we see this Fed pivot. But we think that there is a narrow past with soft landing in the US, but it's not impossible because actually, 4% unemployment is not really a deep recession. So we have to weather the storm and we look at every asset class with kind of fresh eyes because the valuation landscapes have changed. And frankly, the risk we were of safe government bonds, I mean, US treasuries is, I think, second to known. So we hold cash. We overweight the safest segments of fixed income. We are underweighting the riskier segments of fixed income. And we are pretty much neutral on equities, especially on developed markets. We just had a line cross from the financial times on the bank of England actually guaranteeing activity beyond what it said was the initial deadline. This is according to people who have been briefed and that the FT has spoken to citizens not an official line yet, but it would represent a bit of a flip flopping and it undermines the credibility of the bank of England. How do they get out of this situation? It's causing more turmoil, not just in the UK assets, but this is going far beyond. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. This is going far beyond because when you think about it, the UK has a fiscal position which is better than many other countries in the world. And with a much more şekilde, we will opponents alongside the government. I have two lead members.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2032,2022-10-12 04:23:47
13807," This is going far beyond. Oh, absolutely. This is going far beyond because when you think about it, the UK has a fiscal position, which is better than many other countries in the world. I mean, 85% debt to GDP, it's 100 in France. It's not an easy job, frankly. And the thing is that for me fundamentally, for pension funds, it's good news to have higher government yields. And I understand the face margin goes because of the brutality of the move compared to their liability management. But I think, frankly, it's not an easy job. You see several parts of the bondage of central banks conflicting between financial stability and price stability. And also government conflicting. Frankly, I have no easy fix for that. But I tend to trust the financial system in the UK. And I'm sure that all the central bankers in the world are looking at what happens in the UK with lots of attention. Maurice, I just want to leverage your expertise on the inflation side as well, because we're counting down to CPI tomorrow. Today we get PPI. It gives us a little bit of a preview of what we could expect. What's going to be the swing factor here this time around? What are you looking for? Well, definitely in the US, for us, the job situation is more important than the headline CPI, which is in a way backward looking in one month. And what matters the most really is about the wage component, I think. In a way, let's imagine that the number is slightly better than the consensus. Again, we are all used behaviorally to quick fixes. So if it's better, people will start to think, oh, there will be an early pivot. And I think that any hope for early, early fed pivot is just delusional. And I hope we won't see that. That's why we see this extreme volatility. For me, we should be a consensus. It looks reasonable to me. Yeah, it's very high. 8.1% if it's 8.2, 8.3% doesn't sense a big picture. And if it's 7.5, I hope that markets will not start to believe that the fed will stop. They won't. Some strong views. That's why we love having you on the program. Thank you, Maurice, for making the time. That's a Maurice Gravier. He's the CIO for wealth management at Emirates, NVD. Well, we still have, of course, a lot to get into in terms of some of the stories we're following for you. The Kathy Woods flagship ETF has hit lows reached during the deaths of the pandemic. The fund has plummeted 62% so far this year, more than twice the pace of the plunge of the S&P 500 would spoke with Bloomberg's Eric Schatzger at the Greenwich Economic Forum. We agreed that if inflation and interest rates took off, that would be a problem for high valuation stocks. But I do think what is happening now, we saw a dry run of it before COVID. So if you remember before COVID, as we realized what a problem we had on our hands, the globe had, I think the markets were down in one month's time 25%. We were down 46%. From those lows, as you just said, we from April 20 to 21, 35360%, since then, just to keep the perspective here, down 75% at our low in May. Now, we're probably testing it today, as we speak. So we shall see. I think one of the things that has happened is during risk off periods, we see a rush back into indexes. Even so, a lot of the markets gone passive. But when we move into risk off, this idea of career risk, business risk, surfaces and discussions, and there's a movement back into benchmark stocks, we don't own the big benchmark stocks. Only one of our stocks has made it into the benchmarks and that's Tesla. And believe it or not, Tesla has held up better than our portfolios, right? So I think there's been a lot of algorithmic trading. I felt it pre-COVID, the variables algorithms focused on, cash burn, cash cushion. And yet, at the time we were saying, wait a minute, this makes no sense. This is COVID and we need to solve this problem, innovation solves problems. And so that was one of the reasons we had that swish, right? We were solving problems, global digitalization, figuring out how to, we sequenced that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2033,2022-10-12 04:27:53
13808," Who is one of the reasons we had that swish, right? We were solving problems, global digitalization, figuring out how to, we sequenced the coronavirus and so forth. I think the same thing now. We've had this incredible decline. We have so many more problems now, supply chain, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Innovation solves problems, and yet these algorithms and very short-term time horizons. ours is five years. The market in risk off goes to one quarter. Algorithms are dominating the market. It's very interesting. Most people don't know what our companies do. And they don't know the kinds of problems they are solving. But as we've gone through this period, the 75% decline, we've concentrated from 58 names to 33 names to our highest conviction names. Typically, that's a very good strategy for the turn in the market. Cassie Wood at the Greenwich Shake, and on the forum there from Greenwich, I take you to GMT to front and center with the cable trade, where we're seeing a renewed wave of volatility driven by a story from the financial times. The Bank of England is signaling to lenders. It is prepared to prolong bond purchases. Remember, we had quite a bit of rhetoric overnight from the Bank of England saying, this is a hard deadline. You got to be out by the end of the week. Whatever it is that you need to do to get your liability sorted out, it needs to be done by that particular date. Now, a little bit of a contrarian indicator, which, if correct, and if it materializes to be true, would undermine and represent a bit of a policy flip flop from the Bank of England, intraday we're still holding above 110, but there are broader questions and considerations that are going to be discussed over the next few hours here from the cable trade. I take you to the Middle East equity markets where we're seeing once again, the sentiment tracking global shares broadly negative led by losses on the Abu Dhabi exchange, down about 8 tens of 1% and in Doha, we're down about 1.2%. The argument is that a potential recession would take down the oil prices, which of course has been the backbone for much of the outperformance of Gulf markets. We've discussed that with Ali Al-Adulin in a moment. This is Bloomberg. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. We're just honest. We've had sort of a shift in our wean and sort of cypheration fears moment.

Bloomberg government provides our clients with expert reporting, analysis, and public affairs tools that give you the edge in reaching policymakers on the hill.

13809," Information and connections are the currencies on which you rely. For knowledge you can act upon, the differences, Bloomberg government. This is Blumak Daybreak Middle East. Our top story is this morning. The pound gains as the FT reports that the Bank of England has signaled privately to bankers that it could extend its emergency bond buying program past this Friday's deadline. Cleveland Fed President Lorena Mester tells Bloomberg that officials need to keep raising interest rates in order to quail searching inflation. Right now the fund rate is just approaching a neutral of funds rate and we really need to get it above neutral for a time if we want to put inflation on the dowry path. President Biden voices his fury with Saudi Arabia over OPEC plus oil production cuts using the Kingdom of Alley itself with Russia and vowing to punish Rhea. And we hear from Cassie Wood as her flagship ETF hits lows reached during the depths of the pandemic after following 62% so far this year. Let's circle back on the markets in Asia. Julie, it's all they has all the highlights from our Singapore studio. Jules, what's on your radar? Well again we are seeing another risk off session. Yusuf, a fourth day of declines here in Asia with the regional benchmarks still at those April 2020 lows. You've got Chinese stocks holding at six month lows and a Hang Seng index at a decade lows. So a lot of headwinds of course on not only the global recession fears but also the domestic front here too as we continue to see weakness coming through in these chipmakers in the region and China's market also not helped out by the fact that we had some data from aggregate financing and new yuan loans that both beat consensus but haven't really given enough of a boost to investors to really buy into those markets. We're also watching of course big moves in the currency market. We had the bank of career coming through once again with a jumbo hike a 50 basis point hike. The Korean one is rising against the dollar but of course the bank of career once again warning about the concern of the depreciation of the one which is at that 13 year low against the greenback and the yen at 146.2.1 which is of course that level that we saw intervention in September. A lot of speculation as to whether or not you will see officials step in to try and stem the decline of the yen against the dollar too. And just a quick word on Vietnam standing out there with a gain of 3%. Remember that that market did have big falls earlier in the week and that was after we had a run on one of the major lenders there but regulators really trying to calm the market and saying that the customers that raised to pull their money from that bank everything is looking so far, so good use of. For investors who were positioned for upside chip stocks they had a horrid week. What fruit are paying could we be seeing in some of these trading ideas? Yeah not looking good again they're homesaying tech index on the lunch break down for a fifth session so that is holding at the lows since that inception of that index in 2020 and you can see some of the big lagers there the likes of the rich one and Ali barba and of course we're continuing to watch TSMC 2 which fell the most on record in Taiwan yesterday holding it July 2020 lows and Goldman Sachs saying look the latest restrictions from the U.S. are going to have a negative impact no surprise here on China supply chain and consumer demand for high end products. So just adding more headwinds to this sector or people going to really want to renew their devices and chips if you've already got such a glut and of course so many headwinds already facing this sector. Yousaf. Absolutely, Jules. And we'll of course keep checking with you on a daily basis for any updates. Julie Saleh there. Let's get back to this part of the world. The president of the UAE and Russia have met in St. Petersburg yesterday with Vladimir Putin saying that the Gulf nation can play a significant role in efforts to resolve the war in Ukraine. So what Foxman has more. It's a fascinating footage that came through from the deliberations of these two powerful heads of state. What are your takeaways from this event? Yeah, interesting to see them together at this time. This really being seen as a signal that Gulf countries, the UAE in particular trying to push their way into these global geopolitical discussions, being that potential neutral moderator between Ukraine and Russia in terms of solving that European.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2035,2022-10-12 04:37:05
13810," our way into these global geopolitical discussions, being that potential neutral moderator between Ukraine and Russia in terms of solving that European crisis. Interesting here that a lot of the talk was about economic ties at a time when you're really seeing Europe and the United States double down on sanctions against Russia. And interesting as well to see this in light of the conversations that have been happening around Saudi Arabia in the United States. Remember, UAE, a part of OPEP class as well, made those enormous production cuts angered the United States. UAE is not without its own human rights violations. And it's also been subject to proposals by Menendez, the Robert Menendez in the past to limit arms sales. But we are just not hearing that same vitriol in the rhetoric that's coming out of U.S. Congress, that's coming even from President Biden about the UAE, that we are about Saudi Arabia. Maybe this is an acknowledgement that there always have been these ties between the UAE and Russia that have been significant. But we'll have to see if this is something that changes over time, particularly if we see OPEC plus continue on this path. Yeah, I mean, the UAE is seeing an opportunity here to flesh out some of its mediation success of the past. I want to get to the social media videos of workers at a major Iranian crude refinery that could indicate a new stage in the demonstrations. You just put that out on a map for us. Yeah, these protests very significant, not just because we're seeing a new group of people come in and join these protests that have mostly been led by young women, but also because of the significance that oil worker strikes have had in previous iterations of Iranian political change. The Abadhan facility where some of these protests are allegedly going on, and of course, it's difficult to confirm this social media footage, they were involved in efforts to nationalize the oil industry back in 1951. Those efforts, remember, ultimately led to the overthrow of the leader in 1953. And then very important in the 1979 revolution as well. This has been, these protest movements have really been unique in terms of pulling together a wide swath of society, the poor, the rich, various sectors of the economy, various ethnic groups. And so the importance of the oil workers to these strikes is key. We also saw the governor of Bashar say that they arrested several people. They call them opportunists around these oil facilities, intensifying crackdown. We seem to be getting in Iran, but these protests seem to continue on a baited. And then another first, not too far away, this one between Israel and Lebanon, they've struck a maritime deal that the U.S. has hailed as a historic breakthrough. Could this kind of lay the groundwork for a broader, rough, pro-small here on a political level? I think the idea is certainly that Israel and Lebanon, if they share these economic interests, there's less likelihood that there's going to be violent conflict between them. And this particularly important with respect to natural gas, natural gas that could be sent to Europe and natural gas that could be sent to Europe in the near term. The agreement lays out the plans to divide the natural gas reserves along a specific line. And then this long-running dispute, Lebanon, of course, wants money from potentially mining these natural gas reserves over time. Total has been involved, but that's likely years away where Europe really could look to as some of the production that may come from the Israeli side, energy, and looking to ramp up production in the next couple of weeks. So yes, this is a small amount of natural gas, but at a time when natural gas is so desirable, the prices are so high, Europe wants it, Israel and Lebanon both want to produce it, and that seems to be something that has brought them together in a time when relationships have been very difficult. Absolutely, Simone. Thank you for some deeper context there. Tessirmord Foxmouth, the Cut simple financial centre in Doux.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2036,2022-10-12 04:40:46
13811," time with relationships have been very difficult. Absolutely Simone. Thank you for some deeper context there. That's someone Foxman at the Cuttlefinancial Center in Doha. I want to stay with the region. Talk about Ernie season because it's gotten on the way and so far within this part of the world. It's been mostly Saudi firms and have reported numbers. Let's bring in Ani Al-Adhu. He's the head of asset management at the Mane investments. Ali, let's start with sort of a broader input from you on risk assets in the Gulf. Have you made any tweaks after seeing some of the turmoil in markets abroad over the last two to three weeks? Morning. Good morning. Look, we haven't seen in the region. We have been since the beginning of the year. We have taken the defensive stance. Although we are more bullish versus on the region versus the global markets. We haven't made major movements in terms of asset allocation and exposure to the region, especially in the late, in the past couple of weeks. We are still holding close to 20% cash positions, focusing mainly on high-definite yield and names that is actually helping us during those volatile times. This is key for us in terms of reducing the volatility and overall exposure, especially with what's going on in the national and global markets. I mean, look at some of the PE ratios. I just struggle again with how appropriate this is given the volatility. But nonetheless, it's still very much similar to what we saw at the beginning of the year. We have an expensive Saudi index versus a much cheaper Dubai index. Is this the right prism to be looking at the opportunity that is this earnings season going to create a new reset in terms of our understanding of how this recession fear is filtering through? Definitely. Earnings definitely will position multiples. Looking at it from, for example, looking at Saudi currently, we're trading below the long-term average, which is around 15.6 times multiples. And overall, the region is trading at 39% premium to the emerging markets, which is, I think, it's justified for two major factors here. The first factor is the fact that stable oil prices and with lower breakeven points for the market, for the GCC, so you have fiscal buffers. Second, this GDP growth, GDP growth, and especially in the U.E. and Saudi, at the same time, you have growing earnings growth in the region, which is justifying that premium. We have seen, for the past two or three months, some kind of a correction, especially in Saudi, where multiples have been dropping, and even the index have been dropping, which is, for us, is a good sign, because that will create some entry points. That's entry points for you, yes. I look at the turmoil in markets abroad, and now with the Bank of England, that what's happening in the guild's market, also US Treasuries, very volatile. These are theoretically risk-free assets. They're meant to serve as a benchmark in portfolios that ripples through some of the spreads into the Gulf at the moment contained, but where would you be looking closely at to maybe see evidence of some of the risk sentiment shifting, and do you change anything? Again, we have been very cautious, and we stay cautious. What's happened in the UK last, for the past couple of weeks, for us, is a bit worrying about the stability of financial conditions globally. And for us, is that because we are investors in the region, we try to find opportunities where we can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2037,2022-10-12 04:44:58
13812," And for us is that because we are investors in the region, we try to find opportunities where we can avoid volatility and enhance returns to our risk adjusters and provide the same returns to our investors. So for us is that when we have this cash buffer and focus on defensive segments of the stock market, we are doing our best in terms of protecting our, you know, the returns of the portfolio versus what's happening globally. I mean, I can see it been active in the property market because it's holding up very well here in Dubai. There's a lot of demand, especially for some of the prime real estate in sort of the key downtown and sort of other high net wealth areas as they're considered sometimes. The PMI was strong as well that came through, right? So that's still far above 55, not just expansion, but very strong expansion. Do you worry that Dubai might be the last to kind of realize that the party stopped around the world? And that this is maybe a time to be just a little bit more careful? Definitely, I look at things until now, numbers are strong. I think next year, global conditions might worsen. And that, you know, we can see some, a bit of slow down globally that will might impact the region anyway or another. But on a relative basis, we still see value in the region in terms of influx of, for example, you're talking about real estate. Real estate have, we have seen a lot of demand for real estate in the U.S. specifically. Given the fact that you have a strong, very good infrastructure, financial sector, the financial sector have been actually attracting talents and attracting companies and banks from around the globe. So these factors are still going to put some floor on in terms of down site sales. Always great catching up and comparing notes, Ali and I do, ahead of asset management of demand investments. Well, we still have much more to come. This is Bloomberg. All right. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Perl, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can. Weekdays on Bloomberg.

13813, market conditions demanded that this is according to three people unidentified to a briefed on the discussions is not clear when the BOE spoke to some of the lenders nor were some of the other liability driven investment manager involved but still we're seeing quite a bit of a movement in the cable train here currently we're a little bit stronger for the pound up about three tenths of one percent just under a one ten what a ride that's been taken from the ride in the foreign exchange markets the guilt markets to the ride and the least markets or equities expert for the barame joins us around the set let's start off with the city downgrade on farony what is the thesis well for farry use if they don't get it from by to neutral because there's they think that the high inflation in each of those we saw earlier this week will affect discretionary spending and that tree that would affect the volumes for farry which is a digital payments platform they think that the microfinance segment that they're introducing will come under a lot of focus again with the again consumer spending being so tight right now because of the inflation that we're seeing in Egypt the really interesting thing from that report though is that city thinks that any hopes for a market rally in Egypt is far too optimistic because of the macroeconomic backdrop is really really difficult such as what's happening with the pound is well whether the tuition pound I know you're just talking about the UK one as well as the inflation story now when I grew up in Ria one of the stores I'd go to was mahalavi which was a store for eyeglasses and sort of shades and even though I no longer deal with them directly now they've become so big that they're looking at an IPO my glasses are actually from my grave myself so I still deal with them but yeah they are planning an IPO Bloomberg reported that they're looking to list their hospital unit in Saudi Arabia by next year and that again comes on the back of that boom if we just look at what happened with the Arabian drilling last night their IPO price at the top end of the range 43 billion dollars of order for 700 million IPO million dollar IPO so it's absolutely impressive it was covered across the entire price range use if again another sign man that's still for companies despite we saw Saudi stocks entering a bear market we also had Bridgiel it kind of was the opposite of what happened with Salikandio that up their IPO size they downscaled they closed it to international investors but it still went up and it's soared for the first and second day of trading all right then what do we have on the earnings front it's just starting to get a little bit warm here in the Middle East especially Katari company have you been outside well it's quite warm but in terms of earnings we had Q&B kick off the earnings season for the banks and there would they beat city estimates because of their revenues and lower OPEX that was you know they also missed city estimates but they said that the long growth was muted Bloomberg intelligence as well expects that this year long growth will be in the low single digits for Q&B so that's a story to watch out for again with the higher interest rates that could be driving that and then on the flip side we had Katari cement another smaller company but so reporting a rise in earnings from a year ago another sign maybe perhaps of all the construction we're seeing Katari paying off but still solid earnings here in the region yeah and that they were able to maintain a bit of resilience in the margins so far thanks for that that's a farah on the highway there so much more to come this is Bloomberg all street prepares for the latest read on inflation the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2039,2022-10-12 04:53:44
13814," All Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hawkishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike is starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still sticky. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite a ways away from the fall. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday on Bloomberg. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Thank you, England Governor Andrew Bailey, warning fund managers that they have until the end of this week to wind up positions that they can't maintain before the central bank holds its support. But within the last hour, the FT reporting that the bank of England has actually signaled privately to bankers that it could extend its emergency bond buying program. Let's get out to Bloomberg's Leon Garence for more on this. So Leon, just within a few hours, you know, a story that really undermines the credibility of the bank of England and will represent potential. There's a lot of pain not just for the power, but for the guilt, open, laid in the day. You said, I think that you've hit the nail on the head. It's really about credibility, isn't it? Because yesterday we just heard that sound there from Andrew Bailey and he said the bond buying program has to end on Friday. It was only temporary for the bank of England to help these pension funds get out of the situation that they were in since the mini budget by Quasie Quarteng. And then as you say an hour ago, we heard these reports from the FT that are saying that the B.O.E. Governor Andrew Bailey had signaled to bankers that he was actually thinking of extending this program. So what we could see now is the pound has reversed its losses. But yesterday the pound did fall on the news from Andrew Bailey. So we have to really wait to see what happens as you say when the guilt markets do open today, but we seem to be in a fragile situation at the moment. Yeah, and the risk is that the bank of England is kind of drawn into a constant reactive mode where they have to comment and contextualize, not just what's happening in the market, but all the speculation that surrounds it. In the meantime, we've got monthly GDP data coming through as well. What are we expecting? Just want to touch on that speculation. That speculation is really because remember when Quasie Quarteng, it doesn't feel that long ago, but at the end of September amounts, announces mini budget. And that's really what sent the market into turmoil. And a lot of those tax cutting agendas he set out were unfunded. And of course, the bank of England had to step and just five days later with this bond buying program to try and save the pension. And we saw that happen and because we still haven't got these OBR forecastle the fiscal statement from the Chancellor Quasie Quarteng, he was speaking in the comments yesterday and really did praise Andrew Bailey. We're now still in the situation when it comes to market turmoil, you see. And then yes, we do have GDP out later, something else we need to touch on. And Bloomberg economists are expecting that to fall slightly. And that, you know, what we're looking at is we're looking at the August numbers when it comes to GDP. So this is before Quasie Quarteng's mini budget and also before we saw all this market turmoil, but it also shows that people here in the UK were becoming cautious at that time and spending less money according to Bloomberg economists. And that's ready.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2040,2022-10-12 04:58:02
13815," except that there's a limited amount. Well, based on what you've just said, why would you not put a big short of some type on cryptocurrencies, or maybe you have, but do you think that's a good short? Well, you know, when we look for the subprime, the reason why we shorted the subprime and size, because it was asymmetrical, you're shorting the bond at par that has a limited duration, that trades at a 1% spread of treasures. You can't lose more than the spread and the duration. You can get a fit to false, you can make the par amount. In crypto, there's this unlimited downsell. So even though I could be right over the long term, in the short term is the case of Bitcoin, you know, 1% from 5,000 to 4,500. You know, I would be wiped out on a short side. So it's just too volatile to short. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to DevBreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology with the lineup. Welcome to DevBreak Australia. Welcome to DevBreak Australia. Welcome to DevBreak Australia. Good morning. This is Bloomberg Daybreak here up. I'm Danny Burger in London. And these are the stories that set your agenda. Bailey, Sink, Stocks and Sterling, the Bank of England Governor triggers a sell off in the pound and the S&P 500 after confirming the end of UK market support. Recession risk, President Biden admits a downturn is possible. The president also says Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the OPEC output cut. Oil is lower today. Plus a 10 point plan, Germany and the Netherlands will propose joint gas purchases to contain prices. Well, it's not just liquidity on the line. It is central bank credibility on the line as well. The FT out with a bombshell this morning reporting that Andrew Bailey privately told bankers that he will continue. He will extend that bond purchasing program. This comes just 10 hours after Andrew Bailey giving a speech in Washington saying, you've got three days left. You've got three days left to support to figure out your liquidity positions. This looks like a backtrack. Again, is it credibility on the line? Well, the immediate impact. Let me show you what happened with Sterling because that popped higher. Gaining versus the dollar after having a very soggy day yesterday. We're back below 110. We're at 109 at this moment. Just below 110. But you can really see exactly where this headline hit right at this moment. You get this bid higher in Sterling. It's fading a bit. A lot of uncertainties remain, but still it is a confusing time for these markets. And it is rare when we have the UK being the thing that moves global markets. But it's indeed what happened when we had that speech from Andrew Bailey last night. Considering guilt markets were closed. Yes, the pound fell. But we also saw a US bond sell off. We saw US stocks sell off as well. So it is clear the global impact the UK is having. Let me show you the board of those cross asset global markets. Now, we are seeing weakness continuing in European stocks. I have to play some catch up with the US, which fell yesterday when Europe was closed. The US bearing a little bit better. I should say we're on the highs of the future session. After that F.T. report of Andrew Bailey potentially backtracking on ending the bond buying program. Same goes for the 10 year yields. We're down now two basis points. It was down about one basis point before the story. Even so, we're hanging around the highest yield since 2010. Long end, it got smoked yesterday. Again, it's the issue in the UK dominating these global bond markets. Hong Kong tech. A separate story here. This is the worst. The lowest this index is since it was formed a couple years ago. It's the chip makers that are getting hurt this morning. We had Intel, a Bloomberg scoop that they're cutting staff considering the weakness in the PC sector. And of course, those US regulations around tech around sending semias to China is also part of this story. All right. I want to dig deeper into this BOE story. And of course, the market impact. We're going to do that with endoccurrent and David Finnerty. We're also going to get more insight from Central.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2041,2022-10-12 05:05:18
13816," of this story. All right, I want to dig deeper into this BOE story. And of course, the market impact. We're going to do that with Enda Curran and David Finnerty. We're also going to get more insight from Central Banks on the Bank of Korea with Juliette Sally at a Singapore. So we had Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey yesterday warning fund managers that they have until Friday to wind up positions that they can't maintain before Central Banks halt its market support. Now, he said that the temporary intervention will end on Friday, despite calls from a lobby group to extend the program. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. My message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Those comments right there, they didn't just rattle sterling. They rattled broad markets. We had to sell off in the pound and U.S. stocks. But then the bomb shelved this morning, the FT reporting that the BOE privately told bankers that it might actually prolong bond purchases beyond that Friday deadline, which Andrew Bailey so starkly emphasized yesterday for more or less bringing Bloomberg's end to Curran. And to what do we make of all this? Well, on the one hand, Governor Bailey is throwing the gauntlet down to markets telling them we are going to end their intervention on the date that we said we would. And it's up to all of you to go and sort out and clean up your positions ahead of them. So he's giving them due warning. But of course, market participants are responding by saying, hey, look, that might not be possible. We're going to need a bit more time than that. And B, there's also an element of staring down the Bank of England's bluff by saying, who's going to blink first here? Will the Bank of England go ahead and pull out of the market and let borrowing costs go that the way they probably will go? Or will they have to be forced to intervene a continuing intervention and keep a lid in those borrowing costs? So there is a lot of stake here. That's the market story. The bigger story, then of course, is credibility because there's already been damage to the UK fiscal authority because of the budget that was announced a few weeks ago and the way that was received. Now you've got the Bank of England on the line. If they don't get this high stakes game right and if they are seeing as having to retrieve in front of the markets and intervene again, that certainly won't do a lot for their credibility. So there's a lot of rest of you and whether or not Governor Bailey and his team can pull this off. Yeah, well, anyone heed his warning that they need to sort their positions out by Friday. If they do think he's just going to go back on his word and extend the deadline, end to thank you so much, End to Current in Hong Kong. Now that drama in the UK market, it adds to already brewing angst about the state of this global economy. We have the IMF yesterday warning that the worst is yet to come and even U.S. President Joe Biden said that a slight recession is possible. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly. Well, look, think about what's happened. We have done more. We're in a better position than any of the major country in the world. Let's bring in Bloomberg's David Finnerty. I mean, David, we saw the long end of the U.S. yield curve selling off yesterday. It's not something you'd necessarily expect, given we have recession warnings across the board, is this a bond market who's selling off in line with fundamentals, or is this just the UK tail wagging the dog? I think it's a bit of both to be realistic, because bond markets do tend to follow each other, particularly the developed market. So the turmoil that you're seeing in the UK market is having some spill over. Having said that, obviously, there are inflationary fears globally. That's obviously impacting the bond market. But let's not forget we have U.S. inflation data out tomorrow, which will be heavily watched, and depending on what that reading is, particularly the core reading, if that comes in high, then you're going to have these worries that inflation fears definitely exist. The Fed will need to hike even higher, that will see more pressure on yields. So it's a bit of both the global factor inflationary problem and the UK adding to the turmoil. David, I wonder how ripe this market is with fire sales. I was reading one of our stories saying that Columbia Thread Needle and one of their property, UK property funds, they've had to halt redemptions. Is that what we're witnessing right now, market-wide fire sales? I think it depends on everyone's slightly different. I wouldn't say it's market-wide at all. I'm not sure that our some fire sales going on. If you look at the market, in certain circumstances, certainly in equities, you're normally seen it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2042,2022-10-12 05:09:48
13817," I don't say it's market-wide at all. I mean, I'm sure there are some fire sales going on. If you look at the market, in certain sense, it's certainly inequities. You're not only seeing panicking there, you've seen a lot more in the bond market, but again, that's really related to what's going on at the moment in the UK, these fire sales that are being forced to happen. But I wouldn't call it general. Now, of course, the question is, what's going on in the UK? Does that extrapolate over into other markets? And if it does, that creates obviously a bigger problem, and then you may definitely see a lot more fire sales. Okay, David, thank you very much. Bloomberg's David Finnerty. Now, some breaking lines coming through on Phillips. They're going to be recording a non-cash charge in the third quarter of 1.3 billion euros. They also are saying they're seeing a worsening macro environment. It's something we hear from corporation after corporation, given the issues with the strong dollar and concerns about a recession. Now, in the third quarter revenue, they did beat estimates. Slightly, when you were phrase that, they came in slightly under estimates. The estimate was for four and a half billion euros. It was 4.3 billion euros. So a non-cash charge, worsening macro environment and missing on the third quarter preliminary revenue. All right, let's turn to Asia now, where there's been another jumbo rate hike and further yen weakness. Juliette Sally isn't Singapore with the latest, Jules. Yeah, Danny, we've certainly seen a bit of unwinding of positions and a pullback in the dollar on that BLE speculation, but failing to move the yen, which is back at these levels that sparked intervention last month. So a lot of speculation, will we see that again? You've got the Forex Chief and the Finance Minister in Washington, VG20, but a spokesperson telling reporters that they are watching the moves in the FX market with a sense of urgency. We're still seeing weakness, so really filtered through into the Asia Pacific for a fourth day at these April 2020 lows. You mentioned the weakness in the Hangseung Tech Index, the Hangseung Index itself, is at a decade low in Goldman Sachs, saying that, of course, these new curves on the exports really just adding two woes for China's supply chain. We are watching an uptick though in the Korean one, up about six tenths of 1% against the greenback. Let's flip the board and have a look at that jumbo hike that we saw from the Bank of Korea because Governor Rih really pointing to these big FX moves, the fact that you have got this 13-year low for the one, as a reason why they went for a jumbo move, even though two board members descended and only wanted a 25 basis point hike. This is only the second time that we've seen a 50 basis point hike in Korea's history, and kind of echoing what we heard from Mario Draghi a decade ago with Governor Rih saying, look, they are going to do whatever it takes to tame inflation, even if it means sacrificing the economy. Danny. Jules, great stuff, as always. Juliette Sally there in Singapore. Let's take a look at some of the key things. We're going to be watching out for today at 7 a.m. time. We're going to get UK GDP numbers, along with industrial production data. Will that change anything for the B.O.E. or are they all on financial stability watch? Then at 10 a.m., we're going to get Euro-area industrial production figures released. Later today, we're also going to get FOMC minutes. Now that should give some clues as to whether the Fed is likely to slow down the pace of tightening. Let's be honest, it is extremely unlikely considering every Fed official we've heard from has said, nope, we're going to continue to hike. Later, we're also going to have a slew of central bank speakers. That includes Christine Lagarde, Hugh Pill, and Neil Cash-Kari. Now, coming up on the program, we're going to be discussing the energy crisis with Deutsche Bank's chief German economist. They say that revamping EU state aid rules will come in handy for Germany. It's a conversation you don't want to miss. Plus, LVMH sales soared, that despite the fears of a global recession, we'll dive deeper into the luxury sector. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2043,2022-10-12 05:14:09
13818," In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK have time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window. And also it means remindsosaic public deeper interest when taking example making Seraph ADDC over time although technology may require some great cooperation. Yeah, yeah. Germany and the Netherlands are expected to put forward a multi-pronged approach to helping energy costs down in Europe. Bloomberg understands the 10-point plan includes focusing on the joint purchases of gas. That's to stop individual countries from outbiting each other on the market. Now this also comes as the EU moves closer to overhauling the electricity market, but Germany for its part remains skeptical over a price cap on natural gas prices. For more on this, let's bring in our energy reporter, Steven Stupcinski. Can you break down this multi-prong proposal for us? Yeah, I mean, it's a 10-point plan that essentially tries to guarantee that member states wouldn't be outbiting each other. In this proposal, they would also put a potential price cap on Russian gas imports, but overall, they're looking at ways to make sure that they avoid what other countries want to do, which is a price cap. Germany is skeptical that a price cap could disrupt potentially supplies to the region, and instead they want to try to figure out a way where there could be joint purchases with all the countries. Now the hard part is how can you get everyone to agree to doing these sorts of joint purchases? How can you get folks to agree to not be outbiting each other? That's not an easy thing to do. Also in this proposal, they're looking at making binding agreements towards reducing demand. Before, a lot of these demand destruction measures were voluntary. Now they're looking at some sort of binding measures. So these are sort of a number of ways that Germany and Netherlands are looking to avoid a hard price cap by suggesting these kinds of ideas. Why is there a resource skeptical of a price cap? I think there are a few things. One, they don't want to set measures that would potentially increase demand. Now, if they were to put a measure where they're paying for the cap, where the government is essentially subsidizing folks' power bills and energy bills, there is a fear that potentially folks will use more energy. Another thing is if you put a hard cap on the import of natural gas or liquefied natural gas, there is a fear that other buyers around the world like Asia would purchase at a higher price. They'd be willing to pay at a higher price, the suppliers would diversify that way. And I think overall, there's also a fear of just causing chaos in the futures market. If you put a cap on prices even temporary, it might lose a little bit of faith among traders who depend on that and utilities who need it for hedging services. Yeah, I'm F.E.V.N. saying yesterday, I'm price discovery is really important in this market. Stephen, thanks as always, Bloomberg, Stephen Stepchinsky there. Now joining us is Stefan Schneider, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, who's been on the 2011 acabien doing very fast.ası.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2044,2022-10-12 05:18:14
13819," is really important in this market. Stephen, thanks as always, Bloomberg, Stephen Stepchinsky there. Now joining us is Stefan Schneider, chief German economist at Deutsche Bank, who has been watching these announcements very closely. Stefan, what do you make of a plan for joint purchases from the EU? Will this help to relieve stress? I think at the very margin. I mean, you have to see that obviously we are talking about LNG contracts and Europe has come to the party very late. So basically there were only a few contracts available and other buyers like for example Asian countries had very long term contracts so it was difficult to get any LNG. So and there was certainly some competition between European partners and there one could argue that actually if they were joint purchases that would basically reduce this element of outbiting each other. However obviously if you have joint purchases you have to agree on payment and you have to agree on distribution and these are elements where we don't see a solution at hand. Does that mean that this is unlikely that we would get joint purchases again just because figuring out the nuances would be so difficult between member states? If I look at the various proposals on the table I think that's still the most likely one compared to a price cap. I think a price cap is one where Germany and other countries are more skeptical and rightly so because it's a market. So either you set a price but then you have to accept the volume or the other around. You cannot basically have your cake in it by reducing your price and hoping that someone is going to sell this stuff to you at the lower price I think that's the fundamental floor on the price cap. And as we talked about during the break set on someone's ultimately got to pay for this who would end up holding the bag? Now ultimately this is going to be the government. I mean we have some sort of subsidy already a proposal which is the energy price break we just saw the proposal two days ago and there the government the German government has set aside a fund worth 200 billion and roughly 100 billion of this fund will be spent to subsidize gas prices and took a fixed price for domestic consumers. Stefan I want to read you something that the IMF put in their outlook yesterday and get your take. They wrote that the geopolitical realignment of energy supplies in the wake of Russia's war against Ukraine is broad and permanent. Winter 2022 will be challenging for Europe but winter 2023 will likely be worse. What do you make of this idea Stefan that winter next year is going to be the challenge? Absolutely and that's not the overall geopolitical realignment it's just the fact that this year but during summer we still had a limited amount but we had a amount of Russian gas to fill the storage levels. Now in next year in spring we'll be at the storage level probably at around 10% but there will be no Russian gas to fill up the levels to the 90 plus something levels we have right now and even if we assume that there will be some floating terminals and that we will get some more LNG gas from other areas it's still that the problem will be that during summer we'll have a hard time to fill up the storage levels so that we can basically hope that next winter will be similar to the current one. So the absolute I mean that's most of the research you see on the German situation has been pointing out I mean a few months ago so that's really no news. It's really next winter will be even more difficult than this winter. So this problem isn't going away Stefan what does it mean for the business model of Germany of a model that was predicated on cheap energy to fuel their exports if that's broken what happens? Yeah you're right I mean obviously cheap Russian gas that was very important for the German industry manufacturing sector and this won't come back. Now there is the hope that if we basically set up a new supply system I mentioned the LNG terminals and things like that that over time we get at least energy cost down from the current high levels in action.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2045,2022-10-12 05:22:20
13820," new supply systems, I mentioned the LND terminals and things like that, that over time we get at least energy costs down from the current high levels and actually in fact as you consider the job, they have come down a little bit but I think there is no way around it that we energy builds of germacopers will not go back to the levels we have seen in 21 for example. So in this respect the production has to change but it had to change anyhow because obviously Germany has embarked on a course of CO2 neutrality which was that over time have faced out carbon eminent emanating energy sources. So if it hadn't been for the geopolitical changes mentioned by the IMF obviously on the slower path it had been for CO2 prices implemented by the government. So I think the German business model has to change it has to go towards CO2 neutrality. There are some efficiency gains as we have seen I mean the energy consumption by industry has gone down by 20% whereas industrial production has hardly gone down but I guess the low hanging fruits have been harvested here and when we want to have further reductions then production has to move us of the country and we have seen that also that some of the companies have not been able basically to face the current costs and have re-located. This relocation will probably at least for the energy intensive companies that will continue. Yeah when we talk about permanent scars on this economy things like that it certainly rings true Stefan thanks so much for joining this morning Stefan Schneider Chief German economist at Deutsche Bank. All right coming up on the program insight into Intel you're said to be cutting thousands of jobs will bring you the story on PC slumping next this is Bloomberg. is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure for something as universally important to human life as sleep mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. everything you need to get set for the started US trading Bloomberg the open with Jonathan Terrell drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. It's Bloomberg daybreak Europe looking at Intel now which is said to be planning thousands of job cuts to lower costs and cope with a sputter in PC market the layoffs could be announced as early as this month with the chipmaker facing a steep decline in demand for PC processors. Let's bring in Bloomberg opinions Tim Kopen on this. Tim are we likely to",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2046,2022-10-12 05:26:34
13821," Let's bring in Bloomberg opinions Tim Corpon on this. Tim, are we likely to see other chip makers following Intel's lead here in cutting costs? I would think so. We're going into what looks like to be a recession. We've come out of two years of a lot of growth. We even had a shortage of chips. If people remember a year or two ago, so we're kind of getting to the end of those growth times. And with a global recession, we tend to see demand for things like PCs and servers and so forth, the big ticket items as well. They're all going to slow down if not fall. And it looks to me that Intel is bracing for that kind of impact. And it would be very, very unlikely that others will not follow suit. It's a matter of when, who, how much, and that kind of thing. But eventually, I think over the next, say, 12 to 18 months, we're going to hear other tech memes, other chip companies also cutting their stuff. And it's worth pointing out that, according to Bloomberg News reporting, the cuts at Intel are more likely to be in sales and marketing roles rather than actually R&D or product development roles. And I think that matters because it doesn't necessarily slow down Intel's product development. It just kind of slows down the amount of people they've got trying to sell the product that they make. Yeah, I one time got a talking down to him from an analyst who essentially told me I was treating all chip makers alike that there's a difference right now between those who are consumer-facing and those who are not. Is that divide clear now or is it just all chip makers that are getting smoked? I think that divide is very, very important if you're going to go around and pick stocks individually. And investors and analysts will certainly be trying to sort out which companies are going to do better and which are going to do worse. But broadly speaking, I think we can safely say that the chip industry itself is facing some struggles and will for the next, say, six to 12 months. And the struggles compounded by potential US curbs, Tim, what have we seen so far in the reaction to that, both in this market and politically? Well, the curbs which are announced by the Biden administration on Friday were not met with cheers at all. The market really, I think, overreacted. If you look very closely at the documents and everything that was in there, you know, it's there's quite some specific provisions in there. And it's, to be frank, it's quite geeky and you've got to dive into the details. But generally speaking, taking China out as a possible market for say chip equipment or manufacturing equipment or materials or software used to develop chips, that is not good. You know, when you take out a very large market, there's no real upside for that. And so really this announcement of strict curbs come on the back of a lot of other issues that are facing the industry. We've got inflation, we've got rising interest rates, we've got a possible recession, all these things are combining together. And the news out of the administration was certainly not good news. So it's taken as bad news. Okay, Tim. Thank you very much. As Bloomberg opinions, Tim, Colpan, coming up, you've got three days left. Or do you?

I'm Danny Berger in London with the stories that set your agenda. Bailey, Sink, Stocks and Sterling, the Bank of England triggers a sell-off in the pound in S&P 500 after confirming the end of UK market support. But a recent report could suggest otherwise. Recession risk. President Biden admits a downturn is possible. The president also says Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the OPEC output cut. Oil is lower. Plus a 10-point plan. Germany and the Netherlands will propose joint gas purchases to contain prices. Sterling sells off yesterday, but now it's unchanged with a bombshell coming from the FT and you, Bailey, privately telling banks that he might extend that bond-bying program that according to sources familiar there and comes just 10 hours after Andrew Bailey told this market, you have three days left until the bond purchasing program ends. Interesting to see what Sterling has done ever since. It did spike up initially on this report up as much as 3 tens of 1 percent, but it is basically flat now. A lot of skepticism about where we go from here. Your US 30-year yields that's hanging tight after nearing its 2013 high. The US 10-year yield that sell off being fueled by what was happening in the UK market. When Andrew Bailey said those lines, you have three days left, guilt markets was closed, but it just really shows the cross-asset correlation and tension and potential fire sales in this market. If UK news has the potential to not just turn around the US bond market, but the equity market as well. To that point, we are seeing S&P 500 futures come back a little bit this morning up for tens of 1 percent. Hong Kong tech stocks. The US is getting smoke today down more than 3.2 percent. It comes with all these tensions in the chip-making sector. Let's focus in, though, on the BOE. The governor, Andrew Bailey, warning pension funds that they have until the end of this week to wind up positions that they can't maintain before the central bank holds its support. He says the temporary intervention will end on Friday, despite calls from a pension lobbying group calling to extend that program. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done and my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Those comments, as we've been saying, they did rattle broad markets, it triggered a sell of not just in the pound, but US stocks as well. But then this morning, we get a report from the FT that the BOE privately told bankers it might actually prolong bond purchases beyond the Friday deadline. Joining us now is Karen Ganesh, UBS Global Wealth Management, Global Head of Investment Communications. Karen, what crazy times? Thank you so much for joining us amid all of it. I do wonder which is the more worse, the more evil of scenarios. The BOE with drawing support come Friday before pensions have finished cleaning up their liquidity buffers or having a credibility issue with Andrew Bailey backtracking. Well, Bank of England is clearly in a very difficult position and it's hard to say which of those would be the worst scenario. And I think that's why you're getting some of these mixed messages coming out from the bank of England.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2048,2022-10-12 05:35:34
13823," Bank of England is clearly in a very difficult position and it's hard to say which of those would be the worst scenario And I think that's why you're getting some of these mixed messages and coming out from the Bank of England at the moment We think that broadly what they'll be trying to do is try to ensure that pension funds have got necessary liquidity on an ongoing basis to make sure that we don't have Some sort of financial accident happening in the UK and but at the same time of course the Bank of England is trying to raise interest rates in the economy Across the curve to try and tighten financial conditions broadly and reduce inflation which is what sparked all of this They're trying to fulfill those two objectives can be in conflict if Governor Bailey says that this is going to be open-ended So I think that's part of why giving these comments to say that it's temporary and while in reality I think probably going to extend liquidity provisions on a longer term basis if pension funds continue to have those liquidity challenges Karen can they really do both can he attempt to tighten financial conditions at the same time he's trying to ensure that Financial stability remains in check the two things they work in opposition to each other You know the ideal world for the Bank of England is actually what happened after they'd initially announced it Well, they said they would be willing to come in but then they didn't actually have to buy that much because the presence of the Bank of England As a buyer of large resort encourage other people to buy I think that's probably what they'll be trying to You know achieve with some of this is that just by the fact that they're there The market can function more more normally. So I think that's what they'll be trying to do But of course on a longer-term basis You know they can't be continuing to buy bonds or are they sort of talking about constantly to tighten them because those are clearly in opposition So you know it is clearly a challenge for the Bank of England But trying to maintain liquidity in the market while not trying to affect the market pricing mechanism is what the Bank of England will be trying to do Here and anyone who watches this show and here's my accent will know that I have a pretty clear American bias So to me it is incredible to see a UK market concerns there which trigger a sell-off in us bonds US stocks really global risk assets when cross asset correlation is so high and so fragile How do you invest around it when things that are moving fundamentally doesn't quite make sense Yes, we clearly have very high correlations across asset classes at the moment when you look at equities and bonds and also internationally You know, although the UK is a relatively small economy It is of course quite well connected into the global financial systems So can have you know bigger impacts if you start to see no concerns or other sort of systemic levels as the Bank of England is talking about I think broadly what we're talking about with investors is now how to diversify Across equities bonds, but also into alternatives as well to try and find some sources of positive return in a very difficult market You know for example this year discretionary macro funds to perform very well one of the very few asset classes that actually delivered positive performance I'm so far this year If you're looking for opportunities here and I got I got some pretty cheap assets in the UK to sell you newly freshly off the balance sheet of pension funds and look I'm being a little facetious here But we we have seen Apollo snapping up CLOs I was talking to areas yesterday who has done the same thing Reports of Goldman Sachs asset management also buying newly cheapened runoffs from these pension funds Do those interest you at all Karen would you be tempted to dabble into these assets that have gone off on a fire sale No for the UK generally. I think we still see downside in the pound in the near term So I think that would be depending on you know where investors at Domicide we would still see some concerns that the pain may weaken further Over the balance of this year and that's one of our least preferred currencies Now but a longer term view, you know We do see the pain as being still undervalued and diversifying across a range of those kind of assets which may offer You know quite attractive income and yield at the moment You know may make sense in the context of a diversified portfolio So you know for the UK, you know some concerns into the balance of the year But if the people are looking at a longer term basis then clearly value is starting to arise there It's interesting you say this trying to invest based on where valuation stands because David Einhorn over a green light talked about this idea Saying quite bluntly that value investing will never come back He says it's because nobody knows what anything is worth and there's an enormous number of companies that are dramatically misvalued",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2049,2022-10-12 05:39:57
13824," investing will never come back. He says it's because nobody knows what anything is worth and there's an enormous number of companies that are dramatically misvalued. Is he being a little dramatic here, that value investing will never come back? It has already come back to some extent this year. I mean, we've seen a much more significant sell-off in growth than what we've seen in value and we have seen investors increasingly getting more discerning about what they're paying for assets rather than just listening to stories, which was very much the trend in 2021. So we think it has made something of a comeback and value remains a preferred strategy for us. I think broadly the question is what is it going to take to turn this market around? I think we're going to need more certainty on inflation, rates and growth and before we're going to see that more broad-based rally coming back and for both growth and value assets. Broad-based rally, how much pain is there going to be until we see that rally, Karen? What is the turning point? We'll see the inflation data out tomorrow. That's going to be a very important measure. I mean, consensus is looking for core inflation to increase. So that is likely to lead to further volatility. That's the case because then we'll start to have to start thinking about the fed and hiking rates. When we look back historically, most of the time when you've seen a turning point in markets is required the fed to be actually cutting interest rates and leading indicators starting to turn up. It's clearly a very different environment for what we're in today. So our base cases for this volatility to continue until we start to see clear signs of the fed is in a position to cut interest rates and we start to see us moving on to the other side of this economic slowdown that we're experiencing today. Karen, with that in mind, I got to bring things back around to the BOE again. Just to be clear, here the FTC saying that the BOE had privately spoken to bankers about extending the bond purchasing program that reporting coming out just over an hour ago. Karen, is the fed likely to face the same pressure? This idea of R star star that it's not going to be because they tighten enough that inflation is conquered, but rather it's financial fragility, it's stability at stake, which makes the fed reverse course and backtrack. Well, I think there's part of what Scott because markets are concerned at the moment is that if you listen to the commentary from the fed speakers, they're doing very, very focused on inflation and we remember back in 2018, there was that autopilot comment that led to a very steep sell-off in markets at the end of 2018. I think there is a feeling in markets that the fed is something of on autopilot in terms of increasing interest rates and tackling inflation. Now, as you mentioned in reality, the significant increases that we've seen in interest rates will have effects in different parts of the financial system, and I think some acknowledgement that the fed is aware of those, I think could ease some of the market fears, but at the moment it does look like the fed is likely to continue increasing interest rates because inflation is very much its goal. Karen, I also was really interested by the story of Columbia Threadnadeel saying that it had to halt withdrawals from a property fund. It's something we've also seen from the likes of Black Rock, Shrouders. Karen, what are you seeing on your end? Are you concerned at all that investors are getting skittish and quickly here? Yes, well, I mean, there have been some outflows from some of these types of areas. I think people have been invested in areas like real estate, we've obviously seen technology as a popular area in 20, 21, which has seen outflows as well. And I think for a systemic level where the central banks will be looking at for is have we got instances where we have these liquidity mismatches where investors are pulling out of funds and then that's forcing those funds to sell potentially illiquid assets into a market where there aren't so many buyers. So I think that that kind of dynamic is something which central banks will be watching out for very closely, you know, and does have the potential to create some of these negative feedback loops. So I think there's another risk factor to watch out for at the moment in this general picture of raising interest rates, having very significant implications across the whole financial system. Okay, Karen, we'll have to end it there. Thank you so much for joining this morning. Karen Ganesh, UBS Global Wealth Management Global Head of Investment Communications. Let's turn now to France where the government is moving to re-quisition key staff at some petrol depots.

13825," Let's turn now to France where the government is moving to re-quisition the key staff at some petrol depots. Excuse me, I, of course, always want to say gas again, American bias and refineries. A dramatic move to try and resolve the fuel shortages that has been caused by multiple strikes of exxon mobiles and total energy workers. Long queues have been forming across the country with about one-third of gas stations running dry. Bloomberg's Kareleen Konan joins us from Paris. Kareleen, how bad is this fuel shortage? It is pretty bad. In fact, it's been a struggle at nightmare for millions of French car drivers since last Friday. You have 31 percent of gas stations, according to the latest number last night, across the country that are running dry. And the situation is even worse in the Paris region or in the north of France, where about 45 percent of gas stations are missing at least one type of fuel. So people have been queuing at 3am in the morning for hours and hours in order to fill their tanks. Some regions have put in place some rationing to limit the amount of fuel you can actually buy when you manage to find some. And some regions have also put in place some priority for emergency vehicles. So, of course, very difficult situation, a lot of anger and frustration across the country at the moment. The strike at 3 out of 6 refineries in France has been going on for about two weeks now. And today actually a fourth refinery in Western France, which wasn't on strike until now, is joining the movement. The more radical CGT union is asking for a 10 percent pay rise. And in fact, some unions have already been negotiating with ExxonMobil already. They managed to get a 6 percent pay rise, but the CGT says this isn't enough. How has the government responded to all this, Caroline? And frankly, how difficult is this situation for President Macron? So the government first responded by releasing the strategic reserves of oil. And this can last up to 90 days, one month and a half. This has been released already for a few days. And then last night, the Prime Minister Elizabeth Bourne went a step further about by calling to requisition some key staff at some refineries. This is actually a legal mechanism that the government can use to ensure continuity of public service when there is a severe disruption. This is a very rare legal action from the government. The last time it was used was in 2010 for the same refineries workers. And at the time, France had been paralyzed by a previous pension reform. Of course, this is the last thing that President Macron wants right now at a time of energy crisis and cost of living crisis. Caroline, thank you so much. Bloomberg's Caroline Conan there in Paris. Coming up, President Biden admits that a very slight U.S. recession is possible. So the American economy is resilient enough to write out the turbulence. That's next. global Bloomberg. has been a person who has been attracted to hair.

13826," I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different types of hair. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. There's going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia. What kind of consequences? Menendus is suspendual arm sales. Is that something you'd consider? I'm not going to get into what I consider and what I'm having mine, but there will be consequences. U.S. President Joe Biden, they're lashing out at Saudi Arabia over OPEC plus oil production cuts accusing the kingdom of a line itself with Russia. President Joe Biden also downplayed the risk of a recession in the U.S saying it's possible, but any downturn would be quote very slight. He's speaking there in an interview with CNN when asked if Americans should prepare for a recession. He replied, no. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg's end to current. It is pretty amazing to see Biden admitting that a recession could be on the horizon. However, slight, it could be considering. He's got midterm elections near on the horizon. The first role for any official dhani is to talk of economic confidence. Nobody in a political leadership role wants to even have to mention the or word. To be fair, the President Biden seemed to go out of his way to say why there wouldn't be a recession. He certainly isn't forecasting on himself, per se. But he did acknowledge that there is a possibility of one. And of course, that's enough, both politically for his critics. And of course, it's enough to feed the economic concerns over the U.S. too. That story isn't just isolated to the political sphere, though. As you might know, I'm F. Dhan Gray, the U.S. Growth Forecast this week. I think there's a broad view that it's going to be tricky for the U.S. to pull off a soft landing given the pace of interest rate going on over there. Of course, key metrics and continuing to remain strong, not least the jobs market, for example. But President Biden isn't the only one who's being asked about recession. I think in most of the analysts community, you'd hear a lot of people saying that next year there's a possibility very little. Bloomberg economics puts it at around 30% of risk of a recession in the U.S. Yeah, let's get into that. Those other calls, because we had the IMF yesterday saying that the worst is yet to come. And we've debated all year essentially if we get a recession, what will that recession look like? Do we see Betts coalesce around a deep recession or a shallow one as President Biden believes it will be? It's a tricky one, because I think broadly speaking, Danny, there had been a view that the Fed might be easy up on its rate hikes by now and sort of stepping back to see where things stand. But obviously that's not the case. The markets are looking for another 75 basis points move at that November meeting. And the official's like, look at a master overnight, make the point that inflation isn't yet where they wanted it. And it's better to do more with rate hikes and less. So all of that pain for the U.S. economy is still coming down to pipes. And the IMF this week as well, interestingly, did mention the U.S. labor market that even though of course it's very strong and some people are arguing it's in a new structural space to make it different in past cycles. But nonetheless, I'm ever saying those rate hikes will take a while to impact the jobs market and that pain will come. And all of that comes in some maybe some months from now. That's when you're going to get a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2052,2022-10-12 05:52:48
13827," but nonetheless I'm ever saying those rate hikes will take a while to impact the jobs market and that pain will come and when all of that comes you know some maybe some months from now that's when you're going to get a gauge of just how much pressure there will be on the US economy that's a domestic story globally of course there's certainly lots of headwinds for the US economy China is in the funk that it is Europe struggling with the gas prices that it is there isn't much of a global growth driver there so at the very least you'd have to say there's a lot of pressure on whether or not the Fed and other officials can pull off that self-landing whether it's going to be a deeper shallow recession that's a very big call that I won't pretend I have the inside the forecast now yeah I mean if you and I could figure out that we'd probably have different jobs and to thank you so much and to current in Hong Kong bear coming up LVMH sales soar despite those fears and is talking about of a global recession we're going to break down the results and what it means for the sector next this is Bloomberg in the past two decades China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity we want to do trade we want to be treated like partners the Chinese came along and said great we don't do aid in charity we want to do business with you global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027 now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China African experts skeptical China has been that guy around the corner with you know a bouquet of flowers to Africa the US you know Europe and the UK of time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window you will然后 LVMH sales have jumped despite fears of a global recession thanks to wealthy American tourists shopping in Europe for luxury goods. Sales of LVMH is fashion and leather goods so are 22% on an organic basis in the third quarter beating analysts expectations. But let's get one analyst who nailed this call is Deborah Adkin Luxury analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Deborah, I mean you saw this jump coming in LVMH's earnings. So what was happening here in the numbers that allowed them to outperform versus other expectations? Okay so I think we focus first fall on fashion and leather goods so 22% growth there in the organic side as you say. That is very much the highest profit area we expected a big pick-up in Europe which came on the back of tourism as well as domestic. Some transition from the US over to Europe but underlying the US is still really strong and those numbers need to be taken into context. And Asia recovery to 2% for the nine months, 6% for the Q3 even though we know that China for now is still flat. Yeah well we were just talking to end up current about this idea that these calls for global recession are stacking up. Do we have any read across as to whether they continue to have this strength if we do get a recession and just generally into 2023?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2053,2022-10-12 05:57:05
13828," Racking up do we have any read across as to whether they continue to have this strength if we do get a recession and just generally into 2023? So I think if we are heading toward deep recession, then of course, there'll be, you know, impact on on every part of the economy, including luxury goods, but where we are at the moment, the high end spenders are spending those entering mid-tier are spending. We're not seeing a slowdown. There were some calls, some questions on the call on Tiffany. So Tiffany has big US exposure and we saw growth there. If we think about the US, it's gone from 26% down to 22% down to 11% by Q3. But that is partly about the US moving to Europe to spend and aside from that, a little bit of slowdown in silverware for Tiffany, but gold is really strong. Watch as a phenomenal. Gold is doing it somewhere at least. Gold is doing well against the market. Yeah, certainly true. So, okay, that's LVMH. What sort of read across does this give for the luxury sector as a whole? Think about most of the luxury sector being based in Europe, so you've definitely got FX benefit. These LVMH sales saw 800 Bips FX benefit. That's going to help with investment, reinvestment into 2023. Big pick up in marketing spend, big events taking place, much more social media event, driven type event. So, it's positive into the first half and the expectation from management of the LVMH is that they carry most of that FX forward into the first half. Okay. Other sides would be China. China reopening more into Q4 and the first half of next year. Okay, Deborah, great stuff. Thank you so much for joining us. Bloomberg Intelligence Luxury Analyst, Deborah Adkins. That's it for daybreak. Bloomberg markets Europe coming up next. Yes, it will be. Yeah. Yeah. Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features down to cross iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage Manager and iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2054,2022-10-12 06:01:21
13829," Thanks from consumers about stage manager, we'll now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that you're a little pretentious. Good morning. Welcome to Riverbug market's Europa Manor Edwards live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away here on your top headlines. Bailey syncs, stalks and sterling, the Bank of England governor triggers a sell-off after confirming the end of UK market support. But just hours later, the FT report the central bank has signaled two lenders, it could extend the emergency bond buying programme, cable and futures pair earlier losses. Plus recession risk, President Biden admits a downturn is possible, the president also says Saudi Arabia will face consequences for the OPEC output cut. Welcome to the programme everybody, lots to talk about. Let's start in the UK, not with the roller coaster of the past 24 hours, we'll get to that shortly bit with some of the latest breaking data that we have. The UK economy shrinking by 0.3% in the month of August, that's the month on month figure. The estimate was for that to stay unchanged, so for no change in the GDP figure. So that is a worse than expected number. This is just the monthly figure and this is something that can be pretty volatile. But interesting to see that on a day where we are already worried about and focused on UK assets. Industrial production, let's just check where we are there. The month on month figure there, dropping by 1.8%, the annual figure, year on year down by 5.2% on industrial production. Similarly, we are seeing manufacturing production down by 1.6% month on month, the year on year figure down by 6.7%, pretty much all of those numbers missing estimates. So manufacturing production, industrial production, whether you look at it month on month or year on year, they look to be a gloomy set of figures coming in around the UK. Of course, this is just one month's worth of data as well. And everybody knows that the story around the UK is pretty fragile right now and working into the winter expectations are fragile for how the economy performs. The same applies to other economies as well, but with some interesting UK dynamics. Now just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading here in Europe, let's have a look at the futures picture. And it's been pretty much a roller coaster as I say for the past 34 hours. The futures don't really do that justice. They do look a little bit more buoyant than they were just half an hour ago, which is of interest. European futures are up just a little US futures up by more up by 6 cents of 1% on E-minis, the alpha futures higher, Nasdaq futures up by 3.4% of 1%. So the sense is that the mood has become a little bit more positive. Is this attached to what we heard from the FT overnight? Let's get to the GMM and show you where we are on a range of assets. The pound was in here just moments ago. Let's see if it's still features. Yes, it's still up by 3.10% of 1% on the GMM. And what's interesting in the journey we've seen in the pound is obviously the pound was sold as a result of what we heard from Governor Andrew Bailey. We'll get to those comments in just a moment. But then we saw a bit of a pairing of that pressure on the pound. We saw the pound rally a little as a result of this FT report that suggested, well, maybe Andrew Bailey, according to their reporting and their sourcing that perhaps there have been conversations about extending the plan on bond buying, which of course contravenes what we heard from Andrew Bailey himself last night. So let's get back to what we heard from him. Governor Andrew Bailey has put the bank of England's credibility on the line with the pledge to end emergency bond buying as planned on Friday. Gilt Eels surged the pound, tumbled and even US stocks fell as investors reacted to Bailey's warning that pension funds have just three days left to sort out their liquidity positions. But Sterling jumped this morning on that FT report that I've mentioned that the central bank has indicated privately to bankers that it could, in fact, extend its emergency purchase program past the deadline. It's unclear from the report when that guidance was given and we mentioned it because it has had an impact on assets important to throw it into the conversation. The bank of England governor spoke in Washington yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And I'm going to message to the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2055,2022-10-12 06:05:58
13830," conversation. The Bank of England Governor spoke in Washington yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done and my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in my business funds. You've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. It's now Maria Manucci, multi-asset fund manager at M&G investments. Maria will get to the bigger global picture in a while. But I want to focus on UK assets because they are actually interesting in themselves and also having a wider global impact themselves. Maria, what do you make of what we heard from the governor yesterday? What does this set us up for in UK assets over the days ahead? I think it's an extremely delicate situation. We have seen how words affect markets in terms of volatility in terms of credibility of the institutions as well. We heard from IMF yesterday the reiteration of the importance of a balance between monetary and fiscal policy in navigating this very difficult economic condition. Any misalignment there, any full step might create additional volatility in the markets. We have seen specifically in the guilds markets over the past few weeks. These have provided potential opportunities for investors over the short term but also brought about exceptional volatility which interestingly is starting to spreading outside the guild market. That's something that we should watch very closely, very carefully. As I said, it might provide opportunities over the short term but it's very volatile, very volatile and very intelligent and navigate. Also, I would say the consequences from a real economy perspective are quite important as well. Yes, we've already seen some property funds, some restrictions being placed on withdrawals because of fears about what's happening around the property sector and a lack of appetite for property with interest rates set to go as high as they are. Thinking about guilds and what's happened there, Maria, what do you make of the fact that the guild market at the long end does not seem to have been calmed all that much by what the Bank of England has been doing today? What do you make of the ability and the willingness of the Bank of England to get involved here? The extent of their activity in the guild market and the fact that we saw again a jumping guild yield yesterday at the 30 year up to 4.78%. It's very interesting because we've seen this asset reaching some of the peak level that we've seen a few weeks back but in a very different way. So if you go back a couple of weeks ago when the initial dissituation unfolded we have seen 30 guilds reaching close to five percent in a very rapid way and there was in our sense potentially behavioural to start with and then linked to the technicals of the market and the oversold positions that we've seen there and there I created some short amount of opportunities for investors to potentially position within but then taking them off very shortly after the Bank of England announced that they intervention. Now we've seen since then that obviously yields a more higher again but there are more past fashion if you want so there is less of that panicky element to it but obviously it is highlighted by the intervention has probably not been robust or as credible as some markets might have expected earlier on so there is still work to be done in there. Yes, Yes, I'm Maria you make the point in your notes ahead of our conversation today that what's been going on in the UK market and just the last 24 hours of fine example of that is a reminder of how extreme price moves might represent opportunities for investors. Very difficult to get ahead of opportunities though that look fairly unpredictable. Yeah, absolutely and I think what we think in a lot of markets is volatility but not always is it type of volatility that might be linked to a more risk of a panicky event and that's what the guild market showed us just a few weeks ago. Today the picture is different so there is more fundamental challenges to it and a lack of direction in terms of what the next steps will be so you have volatility by you also have uncertainty from a fundamental perspective so it's very important from investors standpoint being able to pick those opportunities that might actually be fruitful versus opportunities that might look interesting but then the underpin by very difficult fundamentals and terms of events that are very difficult to to participate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2056,2022-10-12 06:10:09
13831," opportunity that might look interesting, but then the underpin by very difficult fundamentals and turns of events that are very difficult to to participate. Okay, yes, and some of those difficult fundamentals we've seen a negative sense of data just print this morning Maria. So a reminder of the fundamentals there, what about the influence that we're seeing? We've got a chart here of guilt yields and what they've been doing the volatility there. We've talked about what about the influence this is having on the rest of the world, Maria? Do you see that as long-lasting or can the rest of the world put some sort of fire break around the UK? Well, I think what we've started to see in the in the last few days is an ennames level of volatility is across all the sovereign debt market and that could be potentially linked to what we've seen in the guilt market. So this variable sharp and strong move in assets that normally want pen to move that way. So you have this event of de anchoring if you want, which might spread to other sovereign debt market, but that might be contained depending on what the narrative is from monitoring and physical policy in other areas, the coordination between central banks and governments, its crucial at this stage to be able to, you know, restore market and provide direction on what next steps will be. Yes. Yes, sorry, Maria, and that was something a lack of coordination with something the IMF remarked upon yesterday in the UK context saying it's like two people trying to see a car in different directions referencing what the government is doing. I want the bank of England is doing Maria. Thank you very much say with us Maria. Manici multi asset fund manager at MNG will get a more global perspective from Maria shortly. Let's get now, though, a Bloomberg first word news update. Here's Alice at Kins Good morning, Alice. Morning Anna. The European Union is moving closer to a temporary overhaul of the electricity market by limiting the price of gas use for power generation. Energy ministers meeting in Prague today will consider that model, which has already been adopted by Spain and Portugal. However, Bloomberg understands Germany and the Netherlands will argue a cap risks fueling demand when the EU should be cutting Russian gas use. The UK is to cap revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year, a measure designed to stop companies making windfall profits from high prices. The government says the plan will help consumers with rising bills, but has not yet set out further details. The IMF has warned that the worst is yet to come for the world economy after cutting its growth forecast. The fund lowered its global GDP projection for next year from 2.9% to 2.7% citing monetary tightening, Russia's war in Ukraine and China's low down. The IMF says about one third of the world economy is at risk of contracting in 2023. China is doubling down on a defence of its COVID zero policy, a strategy that's become a hallmark of Xi Jinping's rule. The third day this week, the influential people's daily newspaper, regarded as the mouthpiece of the party, mounted strong support of the country's zero tolerance approach to the virus. This comes ahead of a key Communist Party meeting, which starts on October the 16th. Blue Moon News, 20 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Alice, thank you.

13832," I think it's crucial and important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, history surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, you really want wisdom, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Ferrell. It doesn't really matter whether we're technically in a recession or whether it's technically a soft landing or a hard landing, what we are is we're in a period of economic slowdown or deterioration. The Fed and the government together gave an enormous amount of debt and credit and created a lurch forward and created a bubble. And now they're putting on the brakes. So now we're going to create a giant lurch backward. Powell was unbelievably late doing this. I think for a while we're like, well let's continue using because we only have 1.7% inflation or let's keep easing because we don't have full employment everywhere and we blew up a great day bubble. You can't slow down the economy with the brakes that the monetary policy is leading to today without expecting some accidents. Interest rates have got to go up to a level that constricts private credit demand. And when that happens then there's less spending. That's the mechanics. There's going to be eight defaults like you'll get this recession. It's definitely coming. Bloomberg TV guests commenting on the Fed's attempted soft landing and the US economic outlook. Let's get back to Maria Manici. Multi asset fund manager at M&G investments. Still with us. Let's take our conversation stateside then Maria and even President Biden acknowledging recession risks now. What is the outlook for the US and how do you invest around it? Well, we've seen also from the IMF perspective some downgrades all over for 2023. Really, the risk of recession are there and they are present. And I think so far we have been able to have a window of opportunity for central banks to be if you want as all issues possible and move on with our interest rates. Now it becomes more challenging because we are observing some deterioration on the economic data and we have to really be closely looking at how fast they started deteriorating to try and understand what the next move should be. I think it's crucial to look at where we've been coming from which is also like unprecedented years throughout the pandemic where an incredible amount of stimulus was needed just to keep economies afloat but then now we've found really after months. So it's very important to be very data dependent I believe and observing what the next few ones will bring in terms of economic activity to go to where to go next. Maria, what do you worry about hitting first? Real slow down in the US economy or some sort of financial instability. This goes back to the debate of last week about whether we hit our star or our star-staff first but to avoid the technical explanations. I mean a lot of people focus on bond markets and liquidity reduction.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2058,2022-10-12 06:18:49
13833," about whether we hit our star or our star, star first, but to avoid the technical explanations. I mean a lot of people focus on bond markets and liquidity reductions in bond markets and saying that could be the source of some financial stress. Although I should say that the Fed's messy yesterday was quite keen to point out she's watching financial vulnerabilities but stress is still low. Yeah, I think it's the two areas to watch really. I mean obviously the focus so far has been very much on inflation levels and how interest rates have moved accordingly to that. I think a lot of what we've seen in markets so far this year is more linked to that than to a general risk of recession and growth deteriorating and now we're starting to see the new narrative around technicals being coming forward to the market. I think it's absolutely crucial to watch we've seen what has happened in the UK just a few weeks back and I think it's an important wake up call to try and consider these elements when we look at other areas as well. From what we hear obviously from central banks there isn't still that strong level of stress but I think in terms of areas where liquidity is poorer and where some technical triggers might happen it's very important to be focused on those and be watchful. And so as you watch this on fold Maria I know that you are remain neutrally positioned in equity markets you have high cash levels you don't see market capitulation yet how how negative things have to become before we see something that you define as capitulation. Well yes obviously we've seen a lot of movements in markets this year we've seen valuations of course equities and fixed income being on a low the terms perspective a lot more attractive than the where at the beginning of this year and the question is how much are those markets actually discounting in terms of future back news the elements that is still very well anchored relatively speaking is earnings today so we we're not seeing significant expectation of decrease in earnings so far and this is what in the way kind of holds us back and at the same time is how we got to these valuations today obviously volatility has been higher all through this year but we haven't really seen peak volatility capitulation of market real risk of events has been a gradual decrease in price and values which has really responded to what the fundamental shifts have been in markets. Having said that with a longer term perspective I think today some part of the market are starting to look quite attractive especially in a relative sense if you look up where we were earlier this year and that's not for example linked to sustainability which in my view has some very strong undercurrent multi-attrends ahead of them are today priced much more attractive than they were and could represent some good opportunities for investors but we are watchful of any type of volatility that might provide us with additional tactical ask the location opportunities as we have seen really throughout the year and I think we might still have opportunities of that time coming forward. Okay Maria thank you so much for your time we appreciate it Maria Munici multi asset fund manager at M&G investments coming up on the program breaking the blockade the French government moves to requisition key staff at strike-ridden refineries that have triggered long cues at petrol stations we have more on that coming next this is my neck wall street prepares for the latest read on inflation pay fat pay co-ocassiness we're getting carried away the market's been right our rate hike starting to pay off how long is it going to take to super progress on inflation that just has a long way to go instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance inflation is still sticky us economy is still on track and what it means for the fact I think we're quite always away from it this is a fact that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around inflation in focus tomorrow on Bloomberg",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2059,2022-10-12 06:23:19

For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? So really a reminder, isn't it, just how sensitive the markets are? To any commentary about trade, we did see suppression in the U.A. and we did see suppression of futures. That is now being reversed. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. But we still have 14, just under 40 minutes until the start of cash equity trading for this Wednesday morning. Futures actually looking better than they did. The cap futures underperform, perhaps a touch, but fairly flat really. Now, in France, the government is moving to requisition key staff at some petrol, depots and refineries. A dramatic step to try and resolve the fuel shortage that has been caused by multiple strikes of exonmobile and total energies workers. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Carolean Conan who's monitoring the story for us. Carolean, just how bad is this fuel shortage then in France? It seems to have been building over weeks now. Yes, it's been a struggle for weeks, but really a lot of struggles since last Friday because this is when the situation became difficult. The latest number, 31% of gas stations in France as of today are running dry. And the situation is even more difficult in the Paris-Widjian, in the north of France. You've got about 45% of gas stations and the missing at least one type of fuel. So you can imagine the anger, the frustration, the cues at 3 AM in the morning, people waiting to fill their tanks. Some regions have put in place some measures, including rationing, including priority also for emergency vehicles. So the current situation is at three out of six refineries in France, having on strikes for two weeks and fourth refinery from Western France, which wasn't on strike until today, is actually joining the movement today so the situation could get worse. And they are asking for 10% pay rise. There's been some salary negotiations already with ExxonMobil. They don't manage to get 6% pay rise, but the CGT, more radical union, says they want more. OK, so that's where we've got to. How has the government responded and how difficult has the situation become for President Macron? So the government initially responded by releasing the strategic reserve. So this can last up to 90 days, one month and a half, but they have already been released for a few days. And then last night, the Prime Minister Elizabeth Bond, that you can see on these pictures, actually went to step further. She called to requisition, key staff, key personnel, at some ExxonMobil refineries. This is actually a legal mechanism that the government can action when there is a very severe disruption to public service. The last time it was used was in 2010.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2060,2022-10-12 06:27:44
13835," Actually, a legal mechanism that the government can action when there is a very severe disruption to public service. The last time it was used was in 2010, for those same refineries workers who were on strike at the time under President Nicolas Sarkozy due to the pension reform. But clearly, this is the last thing that President Emmanuel Macron wants right now at a time of energy crisis, cost of living crisis, and at a time when the government is trying to pass the budget in the parliament where Macron doesn't have a majority. OK, thanks very much, Carolyn Conan joining us there from Paris with the latest in France. Quick check on the markets then. The Asian session fairly flat now. So risk-athletize has been returning a little bit as we've gone through the latter part of the Asian session towards the European session. We see the futures picture looking a little bit brighter. We see some currencies gaining a little bit of ground against the US dollar through. Things turning a little bit more positive, oil prices jumping, not clear if that's to do with the risk-capitable to do with some leaks around a Polish pipeline, but we'll keep monitoring that story, of course, as well. We saw the British pound up 3.10 to 1 percent turning around earlier losses as a result of some reporting elsewhere in UK media coming up. We'll get to the credibility that's at risk around Andrew Bailey's pledge to end guilt-buying. That sent markets tumbling yesterday and in the early part of the nighttime session. This is my back. I went back and looked at very few secretaries of state in the last 100 years, or maybe ever, have really gone back into government. So why did you want to come back in the government for any issue when you've got eight grandchildren, you've got two daughters, you've got wonderful family. Why did you want to come back in and go through this terrible process we have in Washington of getting things through consensus and getting people to agree to what you want to do? Because I want those grandchildren to have a future, it's very simple. We're not in a good track right now. The world is not serious enough about reducing our emissions fast enough, David. And the result is that the plan is going to continue to evolve in reaction to what we human beings are doing to it, mostly through fossil fuels. Most of the emissions that are going up nowadays into the atmosphere and are creating this increased level of energy that comes from the ocean, goes into the storms, the floods, the rain, all of it is explainable. And it's all linked to the changes we are creating on the planet. So it's very simple, I wanted to come in because I think we have a real chance now to make something happen. And I think Glasgow was a major step forward in the effort to do that. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. It's just to be honest, we've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears moment? People are talking about that all day yesterday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2061,2022-10-12 06:31:57
13836," are we in some sort of circulation fears? Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. Half an hour to go until the start of cash equity straighting here are your top stories. Bailey syncs Stokes and Sterling, the Bank of England governor triggers a sell-off after confirming the end of UK market support at the end of this week. But just hours later, the FT reports the central bank has signaled to lenders that it could extend emergency bond buying. Cable and futures paired earlier losses. Class recession risk, President Biden admits a downturn is possible. The president also sets Saudi-era variable face consequences to the OPEC output cut. Welcome back to the breaker, everybody. Half an hour then until the start of equity training. And the future's picture has really been improving. We've seen it mostly in US futures, or at least perhaps US futures are setting the pace here, European futures catching up. But the European picture improving as we speak this morning. So it started off the top of this hour, looking a little bit more sluggish. Now looks more positive. Yesterday we saw negativity for stocks globally, really, certainly over in the United States and in Europe. And then we saw plenty of volatility, even in US stocks, because European stocks are close at the time when we heard from Governor Andrew Bailey of the Bank of England over in Washington talking about the end of bond buying coming on Friday as planned. That's certainly surprised or shocked a few people in the markets. People talk more detail about that in just a moment. Let's get a Bloomberg business flash. Top corporate stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. Hi, Anna. Interlace her to be planning job cuts, possibly in their thousands, as it looks to lower costs and cope with weakening demand for personal computers. Bloomberg understands the layoffs could be announced as early as this month around the same time as the company's third quarter earnings. LVMH sales have jumped despite fears of a global recession with the world's biggest luxury group benefiting from wealthy American tourists shopping in Europe. The owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior reported sales of fashion and leather goods up 22% on an organic basis in the third quarter. And the US Justice Department is investigating whether Credit Suisse continued to help clients evade taxes years after it pledged to tackle the issue. The latest probe comes eight years after the bank paid a $2.6 billion settlement in the US. Credit Suisse denies any improper conduct and says it is cooperating with authorities. Dr. Bloomberg, business flash, Anna. Thank you very much, Alice Atkins here in London. Now, previous bouts of trading turmoil in the UK have ended in balance sheet expansion by the Bank of England. Our market set is a Valerie Seisell, join us now here to talk about why the Bank of England putting a line in the sand. As we heard from Andrew Bailey, the governor yesterday on ending purchases, why that is making markets nervous? Good morning to you Valerie. Tell us more. Good morning, Anna. I want to take a quick second to look at previous bouts of EM like trading in UK assets. Now, EM like trading, I mean the currency moving to standard deviations weaker alongside yields rising to standard deviations higher. Now, this was a study done by Spectre Markets that I found overnight and I found it very interesting. The two previous bouts of this happened in September 2009 during this little thing called the Great Financial Crisis around the UK bank bailout. And 2016, that was during the Brexit vote and the government turmoil. Now, both of those times were huge stresses in the UK market. And they ended with balance sheet expansion by the Bank of England. I have another chart that I want to show you that points this out. This is why by the Bank of England putting this line in the sand, it's worrying markets because previously the Bank of England has always been there to save us by buying assets like guilt, for example. This is the balance sheet expansion that 2009 saw after the EM like trading bout. And this is the one here in 2016 after the Brexit vote. So markets are still trying to come to terms with how do central banks deal with financial instability when they need to tighten policy? We know that these two times in the past were times of low inflation. And there really was no urgency.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2062,2022-10-12 06:36:30
13837," financial instability when they need to tighten policy. We know that these two times in the past were times of low inflation. There really was no urgency to get financial conditions in the restrictive territory. We're in a different situation now. The Bank of England can't just turn around and offer this liquidity to the market nonstop. It has an inflation fight to deal with. So time and time again, we're ending up with these scenarios where central banks are going to have to look at financial instability and way it versus its credibility essentially. OK, yes. And if there are limits to what the Bank of England is prepared to do here, and time horizon's over, which is prepared to do it, then that is going to get interesting. Valerie, thank you very much for the analysis. Now, Governor Andrew Bailey has put the Bank of England's credibility on the line with that pledge to end emergency bond buying as planned on Friday. He spoke at the Institute of International Finance events in Washington, DC yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And my message to the funds involved, and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. To what the Bank of England has been doing, in a sense, it's been doing its job. It's been trying to maintain price stability as it should under its mandate as an independent central bank, and at the same time address financial stability issues with these other instruments. So we're saying they are trying to address this localized market dysfunctions and at the same time fiscal policy sort of moving in the direction that is more consistent with what the Bank of England needs to do. So that was Bailey speaking last night, European time. However, Sterling jumped this morning on an FT report that the central bank has indicated privately to bank as a corner to their reporting that it could extend its emergency purchase programme past the deadline. It's unclear from the report when that guidance was given and therefore how much weight we should attach to it. But some assets moved as a result of that. Certainly the pound recouped some of its earlier losses as a result of that reporting. Coming up here now, then, a focus on the UK. Callum Pickering joins a senior economist at Berenberg. Callum, very nice to speak to you. So what do you make, then, of this ultimatum for pension funds? You've got three days. Your assessments of what that means, Callum? This is not a monetary policy issue, per se. That's the key point here. So the financial system transmits the monetary policy and the Bank of England in principle, therefore, has no issue with rising yield. It's just how quickly yields rise and the nature of that rise. And what we have in the pension market is essentially an inconsistency between their projected liabilities and the costs they're paying to cover them. And so they're in positions which are inconsistent now with this level of yield and volatility. The Bank of England gives these markets as much breeding space as possible, lets them fix their positions and the need theory should just continue with its monetary policy. That's why the deadline matters, because these guys probably just don't want to accept the losses that they pay to. Yeah, but if it's not enough time for them to sell the assets they need to get the cash they need to anticipate the margin calls that might still come next week, then that might create an issue, might it? Yes, if the Bank of England can talk tough, but fundamentally, they're just going to have to extend this in the event that needs to be- Because there are quite a few voices saying that, even despite the fact that Nadu Bayley said he won't. Well, you would like to put pressure on them. No one wants to crystallise a loss and sell paper that's worth less than it was two or three months ago, but that's probably the nature of this issue. We're going to have to crystallise some losses in this part of the market and then move on from it. And that's what the Bank of England is doing trying to introduce this deadline. My hunch is actually the Bank of England is pretty confident that the losses themselves aren't a threat to financial stability, it's the byer sale that comes as a result of these hedge positions getting margin-called. Yeah, we've certainly seen the UK Business Secretary out on other media in the UK talking about how there's no fundamental issue with UK pensions, which seems to be what many people are saying. In fact, the rising yield environment over a longer time, her eyes are actually going to be helpful, but it is very difficult in the short term because of the hedging positions. Let me ask you what the government does here then. I mean, I was listening to Mohammed El-Aryan yesterday talking about how the government in his view needs to you turn on some more of its policies. And he singled out one very specific one. He said that cut for the lower tax, lower rate taxpayer. He was saying that that cut needs to go because it can't be funded. Or I suppose the alternative argument would be, tell us how you're going to fund it. Do we really have-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2063,2022-10-12 06:41:00
13838," The lower tax payer, he was saying that that can't be used to go because it can't be funded. Or I suppose the alternative argument would be tell us how you're going to fund it. Do we really have time to wait until the 31st of October to get that kind of detail? I think it would put a lot of the market nervousness to bed if the government were to U-10. I'm not sure that they will. The problem actually here, in my view, is not the scale of the borrowing. Because actually if you look at borrowing four or five years out, that's 1.5% to the deficit, that's not a huge amount. UK debt is not unsecure on the public sector side. But this is a government lacking credibility after badly managing Brexit. It's introduced some potential policy risks in a market that's already nervous and the market has just not taken a sober analysis of this. The thing I think that people are missing at the moment is all of this will be disinflationary by this point. The tight and financial conditions through the mortgage market is going to deepen the UK recession. It will bring prices down. So the bank in England, you turn after all of this or pivot, let's say, is going to come much earlier than the market is thinking. Yes, and let's assess the state of the UK economy more fundamentally then. Because we had a suite of data out this morning that looked really gloomy. Again, the business secretary putting a more positive angle on it saying, look, we often get this monthly figure revised and to be honest, it does move. But some of the other data manufacturing, industrial production, all looking pretty weak. Where are we, Callum? In recession. And I think this is probably going to last through to spring. I'm generally the optimist, as you know, but it's been pretty clear since June that the Western world broadly is heading into recession. We mustn't over-intellectualize an economic forecast. Record low consumer confidence. The biggest energy shock in history. Central banks that are powerful institutions but generally pretty clumsy will struggle to get a soft landing from this rate of inflation. So basically, it should be recession. That's a defensible call at this point. Then you ask the question, how bad will that recession be? What will it do to inflation? I don't think we're at risk of a financial crisis, but I do think that this recession will take away the inflation reimpulse. And so by this time next year, the banking union will probably be causing interest rates. Well, that will be interesting in itself when we manage to get down from these really elevated inflation levels. And maybe that becomes a global story as well. What about the pound acting as a safety valve, sort of taking on the collateral damage of all of this? Detention between the Treasury and the Bank of England being expressed through the currency? I mean, to some extent that is as it should be, isn't it? Just how weak does it get? That's right. That's the reason you have a floating-get-schanger. Remember, the alternative, imagine you were a fixed-exchanger. Black-white-say. Meet your peg. What you would need to do is force a big internal devaluation to make your products more competitive, which is basically create lots of unemployment and bring wages down. And so it's better to have a high-employment crisis with a falling currency than a fixed currency and a high unemployment crisis. This is a better option. It's not a good option, though. Yeah, better than wider unemployment, of course. But one about, let's get back to the role of the Bank of England here. I spoke to someone from PIMCO yesterday and asked, is this an issue to use the IMF's metaphor that you've got two hands on a steering wheel, trying to pull a car in different directions? You know, you've got the Bank of England trying to steer one way to address inflation. You've got the Treasury doing something else trying to stimulate growth, which could be inflationary. He wasn't too worried about that. We were talking specifically about some of the financial stability issues they're addressing around pensions. So maybe that sets that action by the B.O.E. apart. But what do you make of the sort of different directions that policymakers are moving in here? That the B.O.E. within itself and then between the two? The tax cuts themselves, if you break them down, probably won't be that inflationary. They certainly won't be more inflationary than the big spike in interest rates, which will hurt financial conditions in the UK. The key bit is the supply side reform and whether or not these tax cuts are matched by a smaller state. It's difficult to shrink government spending, but deregulation plus a smaller state is a general recipe for improving trend growth. So in that sense, these policies are not unorthodox. It's just the approach that we've taken. The confusion, I think, comes between the financial side of the Bank of England and the monetary side of the Bank of England, which are now trying to do different things. The FPC wants to use the balance sheet to calm financial conditions. The Bank of England wants to use on the monetary side the balance sheet to tighten financial conditions. Now, you could say, well, this is the contradiction. This is the pull. It's better to have both of these institutions within one bank so you can actually spot these issues. Remember, the financial crisis happened because we were too focused on monetary policy and we were overlooking these financial stability issues. So overall, this is policy success.

13839," Remember, the financial crisis happened because we were too focused on monetary policy and we were overlooking these financial stability issues. So overall, this is policy success. It just doesn't look like it at the moment. Internal conflict, better than external conflict. Is there then just not knowing that there's a problem? Okay, Alan, thank you so much. Good to get your analysis. Call and Pickering Senior Economist at Bare and Berg here to talk about the UK. Coming up, we'll get back to geopolitics. NATO Defence Ministers gather in Brussels. As Ukraine's president says, he expects progress in the supply of air defence systems. We've more on that story next. This is Bloomberg. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to the air. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding. And how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. The economy is starting to go through the windshield. The financial system is starting to go through the windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. It didn't need to be this. This is the tragedy of the John. It didn't need to be this way. This is a self-inflicted wound by central banks. This is going to be a reminder of October 2008 when people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. With his thoughts on what central banks are doing at two markets and the economy and a reminder back in October 2008, we saw coordinated rate cuts from a host of global central banks. We saw the US government taking stakes in major banks. The Cleveland Fed president to LaResa Mester sees no reason to alter the central bank's balance sheet run off plans. Speaking to Bloomberg's global economics and policy editor Kathleen Hayes, Mester said inflation is still running hot and the Fed should do more. I just want to make sure that we have all the data before I go into that meeting and hear what my colleagues are saying around the table. I think the real issue is we need to do more. We have not seen inflation move back down. We need to see that because leaving inflation where it is, it continues. There's a higher chance that it does become embedded in the economy and affecting pricing decisions of firms and also getting into the psyche of households. That has long term negative connotations for the economy. That it's time to continue on and persevere and bring the funds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2065,2022-10-12 06:49:06
13840," negative connotations for the economy. So again, this is a question of we know that it's time to continue on and persevere and bring the the funds rate up. We know that we're going to have to keep it there for a time until we see inflation beginning to come back down because we really want to make sure it's on a sustainable downward path to 2%. So if you remember the dot plot when the median path from the last SEP in September, we're very much aligned in terms of where we think policy needs to get to it. Okay. Well, in fact, after 300 basis points of rate hikes, you know, it seems that the terminal rate, I want to ask you, does it look like maybe it's going to end up having to be higher than you thought? You have any confidence now in even knowing what the terminal rate is going to be? Many people have talked about something as high as 5%. Well, we have to wait until we see how the economy evolves. This is the assessment process that we're going to be going through, you know, the end of this year and into next year is we want to basically get inflation on this downward path, right? Labor markets continue to be very strong. We have seen some moderation there. We have seen some moderation on the product side of the economy and it really is. Now we're going to calibrate going forward. But right now, the funds rate is just approaching a neutral of funds rate and we really need to get it above neutral for a time if we want to put inflation on the downward path and we do. That was the Kevin Fed President Loretta Mester speaking to my colleague Kathleen Hayes. Let's get a Bloomberg first-world news update. Top stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. The European Union is moving closer to a temporary overhaul of the electricity market by limiting the price of gas use for power generation. Energy Ministers meeting in Prague today will consider that model which has already been adopted by Spain and Portugal. However, Bloomberg understands Germany and the Netherlands will argue a cap risks fueling demand when the EU should be cutting Russian gas use. The UK is to cap revenues of renewable and nuclear power producers from next year and measure design to stop companies making windfall profits from high prices. The government says the plan will help consumers with rising bills but is not yet set out for the details. The IMF has warned that the worst is yet to come for the world economy after cutting its growth forecast. The fund and lowered its global GDP projection for next year from 2.9% to 2.7% citing monetary tightening, Russia's war in Ukraine and China's slowdown. The IMF says about one-third of the world economy is at risk of contracting in 2023. China is doubling down on a defense of its COVID-0 policy, a strategy that's become a hallmark of Xi Jinping's rule. For the third day this week, the influential People's Daily newspaper, regarded as the mouthpiece of the party, mounted strong support of the country's zero tolerance approach to the virus. This comes ahead of a key Communist Party meeting which starts on October the 16th. Global News 20,000 a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg Anna.

13841," In the past two decades, China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said, great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK have time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window they have funds on them. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets, Europe. We have a steadily improving future picture here for Europe. The last hour and a half also things have been looking brighter. Let's get to the individuals who are stocks we are watching. Not all bright stories but some of the Mark Danny Berger joins us with the breakdown. Let's start with one of the brightest stories around LVMH. Yeah, really solid beat in their earnings post market yesterday. So there are organic revenue for their biggest sector that of course being leather goods in fashion. Coming in at an organic growth of 22% for the third quarter, the estimates around 16%. So really solid beat. Interesting to see all these macro trends that are giving other companies headaches are to LVMH's benefit, specifically strong dollar. It meant that we saw a lot of sales in Europe of American tourists coming over taking advantage of that now depreciated Euro in buying more goods from LVMH. Okay. So what about the luxury story? What about chip stocks? Yeah, this is one where it seems like every headline has been really negative. First of course, the sell off started with earnings concerns and then US regulations that self has continued and has been accelerated in the Asia session by a Bloomberg of a Bloomberg scoop saying that Intel is slashing jobs. It could be up to thousands of jobs considering the weakness we've seen in the PC sector. And Phillips, a slightly less rosy picture there than exactly. They downgraded their outlook saying that the supply chain, it is still an issue for them, falling more than 7% pre-market on trade gate. They've also booked an impairment of 1.3 billion euros in its sleep and respiratory care business. They also say their group sales are going to fall 5% in the third quarter. So supply chain issues not going anywhere. Okay. We'll keep those in mind then as we head towards another earnings season. Yes, I get another earnings season. It comes out so crickety. Bloomberg, Sandy Pergo with the latest on the stocks we're watching. More broadly, let's get back to a macro picture of the markets. And the Asian session has been improving. It's now up by 4.1% as it heads towards the close there. Of course, China doing well. The South Korean market has been recovering and we in the session and we saw some interesting headlines just a few moments ago saying that South Korea will swiftly prepare to activate a stock stabilization fund and expand corporate bond support programs. They're actively responding to risks in bonds over in South Korea. All this comes in the context of what countries are doing to try and cushion themselves from some of the fast rising interest rates environments and the strength of the dollar. Strengthening the dollar, not a big thing today. We see a little bit of weakness in the dollar as we turn a little bit more risk on for global assets because certainly see the pound has got to boost this morning. It was weaker but then we saw the F.T. reports suggesting that just maybe they might be room to extend that bond buying program past Friday despite what the governor said last night. But reporting, pushing the pound up a little is up by 2.1% as we head towards the start of what looks to be a fairly buoyant session for Europe. Thanks, it's Blaineberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2067,2022-10-12 06:57:59

13843," I'm seeing some upside because you did have that FT report coming out and suggesting that in fact that support could be extended But the whiplashes there in terms of the commentary from the head of the Bank of England over in Washington suggesting again as Francine was saying they might step back on Friday and pressuring the funds there and then the FT report suggesting that they could prolong it. The Burley at Bamboo is something that's rippling across these markets. You're looking like though after five straight days of losses across the equity space here in Europe and the US that you're getting a bit of a turn around. Part of that will be linked to that FT reporting. The FT 100 currently at just a tenth of a percent. The Spanish Ibex currently down two tenths of percent and you're getting just four points, four or five points on the CAC cap on. Let's switch it over and see how things are adjusting then across these assets. Worth pointing out that when it comes to what's happening in the US, the latest official out of the Fed, Loretta Mester saying there will be a need for further tightening to get a grip on inflation in the US. As we look ahead to that important print Thursday out of the states. Future states side then point in two gains of six tenths of a percent. Again after five straight days of losses, the pound of course in focus for us today on the back of everything that's been coming out of the B.O.E. Governor's mouth. G.B.P. currently trading at one, oh nine. That is gain of two tenths of a percent. The US ten year currently at three ninety two yields off just by two basis points and Brent, ninety four dollars a barrel gaining three tenths of a percent after being lower on the day. An important story worth focusing on and we'll unpack this for you later in the hour is the story around a leak on a pipeline bringing oil from Russia through Germany and the leak has been detected in Poland. We'll keep across that for you. Let's have a look now at some of those UK specific assets. I just want to briefly focus on the pound again and the moves that we saw in today. This is when that FT report came out suggesting that in fact the Bank of England could extend that support, the pound rallied on the back of that gain at least. Currently up to ten of a percent. Let's quickly have a look at GILTS then because of course the commentary from Andrew Bailey did come out when GILT trading had closed. Currently 4.34 as you can see on the two year at the ten year at four fifty two. That's a move of eight basis points on the year there. We'll keep across this story for you of course as markets continue to digest the wit plash from the Bank of England. Governor, Francie. Yeah, if you're a bond trader today, you don't really know whether you're coming and going because he was quite clear. You have three days to get your act in order and then privately he says something else to bankers. So you want to really find out what Governor Bailey wants to do when officials speak and then of course this is repricing around the world. Is this of, you know, a Bailey pivot? Is it a Bank of England pivot? We also now think that we could be in a recession because the economy contracted for the month of August. When you look at, of course, some of the well sectors that are on the move, I have healthcare, energy on the way up, but it's not huge time. I know that there's quite a lot of green, but again, the green are individual stocks, getting some two tenths of eight percent. So it's not that big a deal in terms of the biggest gainers. I have real estate down 1.2 percent retail bank and financial services down six tenths of eight percent. So out of the 19 industry groups that make up the stocks 600 about 17 or down. And this is really about the credibility of the Bank of England. That credibility very much on the line, of course, confusion then for UK investors to B.O.E. Governor Andrew Bailey, saying in Washington, vowing to end that emergency guilt purchase as scheduled on Friday, despite mounting, mounting pressure, market pressure to extend that program. That announcement sent the pound tumbling and guilt yields rising with Bailey an element that pension funds have just three days to sort out their liquidity positions. But this morning, the pound rebounding, as we mentioned, on a conflicting report in the FT, saying the central bank has actually indicated privately to bankers that it could extend the intervention beyond the deadline. Here's what the governor said in DC on Tuesday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. My message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in my shows funds. You've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because, again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Well, we're joined by Dan Hanson from Bloomberg Economics and Pristine Aquino from our M-Live team. When you look good morning, first of all, I don't even say good morning because we're toast. So kind of like hung up on what's going on with guilt and sterling overall. So what was the mistake telling private banks that he'll do more or telling the whole world that they have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2069,2022-10-12 07:07:14
13844," I'm kind of like hung up on what's going on with guilt and sterling overall. So what was a mistake telling private banks that actually he'll do more or telling the whole world that they have three days to get their act together? Well, I think with this, with what he said there in Washington, he's really put his credibility on the line. I mean, I think probably the mistake is the fact that this report has come out since. I think it's not looking good for Bayley at the moment and it's what you're going to see over the next three days is a lot of volatility in the bond market and his commitment is going to get tested. And it's still not out of the question that he has to reverse course. And we know with Bayley, we've seen we've seen reverses of course in the past. But I think the mistake for me at least was the fact that this story was leaked. I think he gave a pretty strong message at the IMF in Washington. And I feel now that people are confused. And you've seen that with the Whipsaw Installing. You've been talking about this Whipsaw this morning. That's exactly what's happening. Exactly. That volatility was seen volatility to the pounds at almost kind of record highs, at least highs we haven't seen for a number of years. GILTS currently, I'm looking at the trading on the 10 year currently, the yields up four basis points. So coming off a little bit, yields actually lower at the front end on the two year. Christine, before I come to you, I just want to mark this John Orther's quote, another fantastic opinion piece from Bloomberg's John Orther's. And he says, this is on course to go down as an all-time central banking gaff. Christina Kino on the market reaction then to the Whipsaw Installing from the Bank of England governor. Well, Tom, it's one thing for the markets to deal with a trust turnaround that we've seen in fiscal policy. But it's another for them to deal with the Bayley Van Boosle, as you mentioned. The central bank up until this point had been a beacon of stability and calm for market when markets were melting down in reaction to the government's fiscal steps or missteps, I should say. But this particular development really is not doing well for them in terms of the volatility that it has generated and markets that are already very, very nervous about the end of this BoE bond market intervention. And you know, markets deal in absolutes, right? They either want a price in one definitive thing or another definitive thing. And so, neither the kind of caught in between, will there, will there be from the BoE, you'd expect them to kind of try and push the BoE in one way or another. And of course, the more market-friendly outcome is pushing the BoE to extend the bond market support to continue or bring back stability to bond markets that have really seen quite a volatile bite over the last few weeks. Christine, what exactly is the mistake? And first of all, I do need to correct myself, because I seem to imply that it was a governor Bayley himself, according to the FT that told bankers that he would continue with the support. So we understand it's BoE officials. So that has to be corrected, because we don't want to say anything that's, that we don't think is true or that we don't know of. But Christine, I mean, we talked about yesterday, the fact that the BoE probably needed to persist with some of the backstop for another two weeks, maybe into the BoE meeting, to make sure that the stability of the bonds was insured. So what was a mess, the fact that he went to Washington and said in three days, we're pulling out, or that now there's all this uncertainty? I think it would be the latter, friend. I think not kind of indicating at least any sense of flexibility over the timeline for it. I can completely understand for the bank's point of view that this is not something that they want to keep going, especially because it does put them in an awkward position, right? They want to be focusing on fighting that inflation fight and really persisting with that tightening policy. But now they have this financial stability issue that is probably more acute and more imminent, but longer term that makes the trajectory of their policy a little bit uncomfortable to navigate. But I think it really is that kind of absolute message that is going to be ending in three days. That kind of really did not leave the bank a lot of wiggle room in terms of delivering the message. Should they need to extend the support, as Fran was mentioning, probably beyond the Friday deadline into that November Bank of England meeting? Yeah, and that absolutist position being watered down by this FT reporting, Dan, what is your sense? Do you think that you're going to have to continue and are going to have to push through Friday with this support? What's your assessment at this stage? Yeah, so I mean our view is they will he's going to have to backtrack. So I think yesterday I swaped Fran on the sh-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2070,2022-10-12 07:11:10
13845," going to have to push through Friday with this support. What's your assessment at this stage? Yeah, so I mean, our view is they will, he's going to have to backtrack. So I think yesterday I spoke to Fran on the show, and I said, we think they're going to have to at least give a commitment to stay in the market, be around if there is a flare up again, or in extremist just carry on with the bomb buying. So as I said at the start there, I think the mistake in terms of communication from Bailey is that he said, this is going to stop on Friday, and then this story gets leaked about Bioe officials. The policy mistake, I think, that's been made, is around not as Christine alluded to giving the flexibility and being so forthright about what's going to happen on Friday, because we just don't know, and there could be flare ups. There might be something he doesn't, he isn't telling us as well. He might know something that we don't know about the LDIs, and he feels more comfortable going out on a limb, saying this, I'm less sure. So I think for us at least the idea of an extension or some sort of measure to prolong stability in the market is still on the table. And with all eyes on this fiscal event on the 31st, because ultimately that's the thing that needs to be rectified, that's the source of this problem, and that's what needs to be dealt with. Dan, I think very quickly, why do you think he was so adamant that it would stop in three days? Well, as I say, I think it's possible he's spoken to the funds and the bank knows a lot more about this than we know about. There's also part of it that he's clearly very uncomfortable about, obviously, the moral hazard element of this, excess risk taking that this sort of leads to. But it's also what I found most interesting was that he's really thinking about the interaction between this intervention and the monetary policy goal of the bank, and the fact that this is essentially QE, they're issuing reserves, the money supplies increasing, and they know on the other hand, they're going to have to raise interest rates quite significantly. So he said himself that policy is pulling in two directions. So I think he's very uncomfortable, and we know that he's uncomfortable with the size of the bank's balance sheet, and this is just making that issue worse. And Christine, just briefly, before we wrap this up, your views on what we saw, it was remarkable, I thought, to see US equities falling on the back of these comments from Andrew Bailey in DC yesterday. What does that tell you and invest as about the linkages and the concerns between what is happening in the UK markets and broader global markets? Well, Tom, I think we can all see that the world is watching what's happening in the UK, and perhaps taking lessons. This is essentially what happens when you have fiscal policy going one way, and then a monetary policy going the other, and also all the uncertainty that it creates when all these institutions are kind of you turning on themselves, right? And the IMF itself has singled out the UK as essentially, this is how you should not navigate a crisis. We heard yesterday from their chief economist basically saying that, again, it's that kind of clash between fiscal and monetary policy that the UK really is getting wrong at this particular juncture. And I'm sure the world is watching. It's a country navigating several crises on various fronts and how the UK fairs will probably reverberate in terms of lessons learned for other economies kind of going through similar things.

Is the two investment officer at Trotter, thank you so much for joining us. There's so much going on with the UK assets and it's really repressing global bonds. What do you think the Bank of England wants to do? I don't think it's a question what they want to do. I think, unfortunately, in this environment, there's no easy choice for any central bank. But I think ultimately they do need to offer a more open-ended commitment to the Gilt market. There's an argument that the British government under Prime Minister Liz Truss has lost credibility with the markets. Are we now looking at a scenario where the Bank of England has also lost credibility? Well, I think that there's an acute problem right now with LDI, which requires some intervention from the Bank of England. They do need to act as a circuit breaker here. I think then there's a more medium term issue about the credibility of fiscal policy and monetary policy. But I think that that is something that we can deal with separately if we get through this acute phase right now, allowing the LDI funds basically to reshuffle their positions and get into a lower risk situation. Do you think that the credibility of the Bank of England is on the line? Is it because of the reversal from B.O.E officials of what they'll do on Friday or just the idea that they can remove the backstop in three days and markets are fine? Yeah, I think the idea that you could sort of put an end date on Friday, I think, does lack a bit of credibility because ultimately we don't really know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2072,2022-10-12 07:19:49

But I think that, again, we need to acknowledge the challenges faced by the Bank of England. I mean, one could worry about their credibility, but ultimately we are in a much more difficult world. The trade-off between growth and inflation is deteriorated all over the place, it's particularly acute here in the UK. But partly for reasons are related to the Bank of England. And so I think in some terms, I'm not saying we have to cut the central banks and slack, but we need to recognise that we're in a much more difficult environment for them. And compared to the last 10 years of the said, there's no easy choices. Do you have faith that they can contain this crisis at this point? Yes, I do actually, I believe they can. But unfortunately with this kind of political situation, and we've seen this before, we saw this with a sovereign debt crisis in Europe, you know, a decade ago. Unfortunately, things often need to be taken to the brink for us to see action. But as an investor, why would you not move your money elsewhere? And we did see, I know the Bank of England got a lot of applause because it was the first central bank saying like, we don't know what we're facing. They talked about five quarters of a protracted recession. And at the time, a lot of people said, well, this is finally central bank. Yes. That was very honest. Are you fully invested in the UK? Either a guild or a stock? No, at the moment we're not. But I would say, first of all, if you think about the equity market, I mean that the weakness in sterling is actually a very important shock absorber for UK profit. So actually, I think the UK equity market looks quite attractive now on a global basis. And so I don't think that is necessarily tied up with the challenges of the guild market. With the guild market, we have in the short term a very acute problem with the need for the LDI funds to reposition themselves. But I think over the medium term, there could be a level at which it starts to look interesting again. I mean, it's not something we're getting involved in right now. Okay, but UK equities are looking attractive on some measures. Yes. I assume that takes you to the FTSE 100, the big cabinet. The FTSE 100, yes, absolutely. What within that space specifically would you be looking at without pressing you to name names, which sectors, which areas? Well, I mean, I think that without going into detail of the sectors, the interesting thing about the FTSE 100 as an index is it's quite a defensive index in a global context. And I think one of the things that we're quite focused on now is a risk of recession in the US and in Europe as we head into 2023. And in that context, the market like the UK, which is quite defensive with a cheap currency, actually looks quite attractive. What will halt dollar strengths and what are the unknown unknowns that it does to other parts of the market? I think unfortunately for dollar strength to really end, you need to see the rest of the world recovering more strongly than the US. I think we're somewhere away from releasing a reversal in the fortunes of the dollar. So unfortunately for now, I think that we're still in a strong dollar environment. And come, didn't mean to cut you off there. I wanted to get your view more broadly. You've talked about your optimism, relative optimism around UK equities. More broadly, global equities, what would you need to see to turn bullish? I think the problem we're having. So first of all, this is obviously a rate-induced bear market. We're starting to see more realistic expectations priced into the bond market in terms of the extent to which central banks will have to raise rates. So I think things are improving from that perspective. But I think ultimately for equities, we then also have the challenge of likely recession. And really we'd like to see capitulation on corporate earnings expectations. So a lot of damage has been done already. That's the good news. I think there's still a little bit more to go. We just need to price in a little bit more pessimism before we can really just shut our eyes and buy. I don't know whether the biggest dislocation also came from what we saw with the opaic and whether foreign policy is back in the fall fold. But also we could see maybe China falling off the brink in a global recession, which is why opaic decided to cut. Yes, the challenge we have at the moment is in some sense you have different branches of policy working against each other. So we have the challenge of, you know, loose fiscal policy working against the central banks who are trying to curb inflation. And then on the other hand, we also have opaic cutting supplies. So this is the challenge we have. That's why we're still quite cautious of markets. We're sort of trying to work out what the new equilibrium is. And as I said, we've seen quite a lot of pricing to markets for ultimately we need to adapt to a new normal now in terms of policy, which is again not something we've seen in the last decade. Okay, Johanna Kirkland, Chief Investment Officer and Co-head of Investment's Act Roaders in on adapting to this new reality, which is a challenge to say the latest.

13848," On adapting to this new reality, which is a challenge to say the latest, but maybe some opportunities in UK equities with that defensive tilt and the benefits of a weaker pound. Right. Coming up, Recession Risk, President Biden downplays the chances of a downturn in the US, but not everyone is convinced we're going to get the thoughts of Maria Manucci from M&G. This is Brigorburg. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice of such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries.

You see we are seeing quite a lot of relatively the pound actually rebounded. So I would say a lot of the stories happening in currencies maybe not in European stocks but it is engulfing overall worldwide. Of course some of the questions about inflation and of course on this reversal was it a reversal from the Bank of England to then actually need to extend it. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg business flash here's Alice Atkins. Myles Hi Francine, LVM H shares have jumped despite fears of a global recession with the world's biggest luxury group benefiting from wealthy American tourists shopping in Europe. The owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior reported third quarter sales of fashion and leather goods up 22% on an organic basis. Intel is said to be planning job cuts possibly in their thousands as it looks to lower costs and cope with weakening demand for personal computers. Bloomberg understands the layoffs could be announced as early as this month around the same time as the company's third quarter earnings. That's your Bloomberg business flash Tom Francie. Alice Atkins here London thank you coming up credibility at risk. Andrew Bailey's pledged to end guilt buying sense markets tumbling. That's before an F.T. report earlier suggesting otherwise giving the pound the boost that we're seeing currently in these markets.

13849," giving the pound the boost that we're seeing currently in these markets. Sterling is up five cents of eight percent training at one ten. Gilt yields, UK Gilt yields, currently unchanged on the two year you're seeing a move higher. Just two basis points on the ten year at four forty six. We keep across this story for you, of course, throughout this hour. Stay with us. This is Bringberg. I'm going to say to the cynics that say, look, it's all nice and fine, but a lot of it is greenwashing. And you're not a good company. You're just a less toxic company than some of the other oil majors. Well, the first thing to say is that, you know, I'm a big believer in we need to put ourselves in other persons' shoes in life in general. And so I understand that point of view. And I get that people have that perspective. I don't agree with that, obviously, but I understand where they're coming from. We have an enormous challenge as society, which is to provide the world with reliable, affordable, and clean energy. That's what society wants. That's what society needs. And I believe in my heart that a company like BP is actually one of the few companies in the world who can actually make that happen. We can talk about the things that we're going to grow and over the coming years. And I find it hugely exciting and energizing for our organization. But that's what the world needs. And you simply can't go against the grain of society. You can't defy gravity. And that's why we're making the change that we're making. Welcome back. It is the B.O.E. Bamboozle. The red head across the terminal, a B.O.E. spokesperson saying that the bomb buying scheme will end on Friday. Let's check in on these guilds. Currently yields up just one basis point at the front end, the two year training at 430, the 10 year up 4 basis points. And the pound currently at 109. So pairing the gains. Just a few seconds ago we were talking about the gains of 5% percent for the pound. That is B.O.E.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2075,2022-10-12 07:32:37
13850," the 10-year-up four basis points and the pound currently at 109. So pairing the gains just a few seconds ago, we were talking about the gains of 5.0% for the pound. That has been wiped off. It's currently trading at 109, Francine. Yeah, it's pretty incredible what we've lived through. Now, we were talking yesterday about, if you're going to stop the fever, that subsides in guilt. The Bank of England probably need to do more and need to persist with the backstop for certainly more than Friday. Yesterday, the governor said he will stick to his plan to end this on Friday, and I have to say there was a bit of wildness on the markets. Then there was contradiction from BOF, officials, this is according to the FT, so this is getting back on track. But this could also pose a credibility problem. I don't think the credibility problem is saying one thing and the other. It's the fact that they seem to say, look, the markets just need to adapt. It's three days, and some of the adjustment could be quite aggressive. Unless they know something that we don't, which is the possibility of what Dan Hansen was saying. Indeed, yeah, that's what Dan was saying, and also the conundrum, the central conundrum for the Bank of England, of course, which wants to at some point, and it's penciled it in for the end of the month, start quantitative tightening, whilst at the moment still buying bonds. It says it's going to end that part of it on Friday, and then, of course, we look ahead to November the 3rd, and the rate height decision from the central bank of the UK. Let's bring on next guests, then, Francine, for more analysis on this. Seven-saurant powers head of inflation trading at the Bank of England, so no better person than to speak with about inflation and guilt. So what do you think the Bank of England sees at markets maybe don't? If the cutoff point is Friday, what are you going to see in guilds and some of these inflation-linked bonds from now until Friday? Hi, good morning, Francine. My name is actually Pranos Shemin-Sohar-Parr. Thanks for having me on. So I completely agree. There's confusion in the market following the comments we got yesterday, evening, and then this morning. Again, there were some reports that Bank of England might actually listen to the patient funds, and if they're delivering flows are still continuing, that they might extend the program, which from a market participants point of view made sense. Because here, the aim is actually financial stability and to avoid disorderly price action. So we do not want to see for selling trigger new levels in the market and create more volatility. We know that this program still needs to be clarified. There's some confusion in the market, because obviously, the Bank of England was in the process of tightening financial conditions with rate taxing. They already announced QT, which had to be postponed. So they are trying to differentiate this program as a temporary program. But still, if the financial stability concerns are there, if the leveraging flows are not over, we will still continue following the communication between patient funds, LDI accounts, and Bank of England. But there's a bit of a confusion in the market, since the news amount that they planned and the program, they actually seeing selling pressures again on the very long end. Yeah, indeed, and to your point, an 11 basis point move in the long end of the guild, the 30-year, that is the reflection right now, and the pound of raising, the earlier gains that we've seen currently trading at 109, the FTSE 100 is also lower by 410 to the FTSE 250 dropping, almost 2%, that's the lowest since May of 2020. The market reaction then post Friday. What is your take on just how high these yields go? I think there are two issues on one point. So the market's participants have been discussing for quite a while now. Have you seen the peak inflation? And does it mean peak hawkishness and build the fall in headline inflation, which we expect to continue, give the central banks a chance to soften their message and maybe hike at the lower pace. And we are even priced for rate cuts in the US at this point. But looking at the underlying inflation dynamics, actually, we are still seeing per the pressure, for terminal rates, to be revised higher, rather than lower and central bank pivots. For example, for the US CPI, which will come out tomorrow, we believe the peak in headline print is actually now behind us with 9.1% print, which was the June click, which came out in July.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2076,2022-10-12 07:37:14
13851," Tomorrow, we believe the peak in headline print is actually now behind us with 9.1% print, which was the June print which came out in July. Tomorrow, we are expecting to see a pullback in headline inflation to 8%. But at the same time, we still see strong underlying inflation pressures. And we are still expecting to see an uptick on the core CPI levels to 6.5%. So again, last Friday, the labor data we got out of US again showed that unemployment levels were still falling, participation rates still falling, labor markets are globally super tight. And we haven't seen unemployment levels as low as where we are now in Europe as well as since the exception of euro. So again, from an ECB point of view, while they keep telling us that the news rate is in the 1-2% range, market actually sees needs to rate closer to 3%, and if ECB wants to tighten financial conditions as well, as we are at 10% headline inflation at this point, we believe that again, they will need to hydrate beyond 3%, and again, the terminal rate projections in Europe can be revised higher as well. Thank you so much for joining us, Chairman Schorer, power their head of inflation trading at the Bank of Ireland, Tom. OK, coming up, a corporate story to focus in on LVMH sales, soaring despite fears of a global recession. We're going to break down the results and what they mean for the luxury sector next. Mr Smith is bez prinpred. In the past two decades China has built large infrastructure projects in almost every country in Africa. African governments themselves said we are tired of aid and charity. We want to do trade, we want to be treated like partners. The Chinese came along and said great, we don't do aid in charity, we want to do business with you. Global gateway will mobilize 300 billion euros till 2027. Now the US and Europe are answering back with their own infrastructure initiatives to counter China. But African experts are skeptical. China has been that guy around the corner with a bouquet of flowers to Africa, the US, Europe and the UK of time and time again say be careful of the flowers you see out of the window they have funds on them. A lot's happening on Wall Street. I think Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bullseye. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Everything you need to get set for the start of US trading. Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Terrell, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Well, welcome back to the open everyone 39 minutes into the European trading day. We had about six minutes ago. Of course, headlines from the UK, Tom McKenzie was bringing those to you. The Bank of England saying that the bond bank scheme will still end on Friday.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2077,2022-10-12 07:41:22
13852," Six minutes ago, of course, those headlines from the UK, Tom McKenzie, was bringing those to you. The Bank of England saying that the bond-bank scheme will still end on Friday. This is about, of course, a bit of confusion after there was an F.T. headline saying that officials had said that they would be able to support the bond market. I have to say, the market is not really taking solace in this, because if the UK bonds extended the fall after, once again, the spokesperson of the Bank of England saying that the scheme will end on Friday. That could mean Tom hugely pricing from now until then. Yeah, and we're starting to see a bit of that. Of course, the guild market. Yeah, absolutely. Focused on that Friday deadline that the B.O.A. have now reiterated the long end. That's where most of the action is at the moment. So I move higher by about 10 basis points on the 30-year, the two-year here in the UK. Currently, I'm changing the 10-year. That's a move higher and four close to five basis points at 448 on the 10-year. And again, the pound, 109, currently just up a tenth of a percent. It had been up as much as about 5-10, almost 6-10 of percent earlier in the session before that redhead crossed from the Bank of England. Let's get back to one of the big corporate stories of the day. Then a little bit of optimism when it comes to the luxury space. And LVMH sales have jumped despite fears of a global recession. Thanks to wealthy American tourists shopping in luxury, full luxury in Europe and shopping with a bound with those strong dollars. Sales of LVMH is fashion and leather goods soared 22%. On an organic basis in the third quarter, beating, endless expectations. Let's bring in then Deborah Aiken, luxury analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Talk us through these numbers and what it says about the resilience then. A very LVMH in the broader luxury sector, Deborah. Yeah, so 19% growth in the Q3 matches Q2. Beats significantly versus consensus. And you get double-digit growth in every category in the Q3. What it says, fashion leather goods prices are higher. If we look at Louis Vuitton-Dior over the last three years, we've seen about a 20% price hike. And that will continue into 2023, 456% per year, as is needed, but costs are quite low. So overall, the market is buoyant for these kinds of categories. So 20%, I mean, 20% of price increases. Does this just go to their margins? Or is it because they themselves have had to pay more for the raw materials? So 20% over three years. So we average about 5% to 6%. And that's partly on mix. It's on new collaborations. It's on different kinds of product within the category. It also backs wage costs. It backs costs of goods. But generally, their costs are good so very low. We look at margins over 70% across the sector at the gross level. So they have relatively low cost base. And we know that most of it is in euros, so they're benefiting on FX. All right, Deborah, thanks so much. Deborah, Adkin there. Luxury analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence. Now, NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels for two-day meeting, as Ukraine calls for more military equipment, following a series of deadly missile strikes by Russia. Meanwhile, the NATO Secretary General Yen Stoltenberg warned this is a crucial time for transatlantic security and reiterated the alliance that stands by Ukraine. For more, we're going to go to Maria Tadeau, who is following. It has been following, of course, the meeting at NATO's HQ. Maria, the war we know, of course, has escalated again this week. How will, and what is your sense of how NATO allies are preparing to respond to Russia's escalation? Yes, and Tom, there's two things the NATO Secretary General will put on the table today in this meeting. Once again, in the shadows of the war in Ukraine, and one, you talked about escalation. He will refer to that. An almost signal inevitably, allies have to either step up or accelerate their weapons delivers for Ukraine, particularly now when it comes to the air defense systems. If you look up Monday, which was a black Monday for Ukraine, eight to four missiles were fired by the Russian Federation across the Ukrainian territory, it seems that once again, the tactics of the war are changing from the ground to the skies. And then the other big issue today, particularly in light of that report by Polish authorities that there has been a leak in an oil pipeline is how to protect critical infrastructure. And the NATO Secretary General had a warning saying Russia should really understand that going after a critical infrastructure will be met with a firm and united response.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2078,2022-10-12 07:46:00
13853," Secretary General had a warning seeing Russia should really understand the going after a critical infrastructure will be met with a firm and united response. So so important, isn't it? As we watch what happened in Germany with some of the transit there, as of course we reflect on what happened with those Nord Stream pipeline explosions and now not necessarily linked, but we are of course monitoring what's happening in Poland as you say, Maria today, live at the NATO HQ and continuing that story around the leak in Poland again reporting that there has been this leak at the Drugeberg pipeline which carries oil from Russia to Europe. Polish pipeline operator PERN says it is unclear what might have caused the leak for more. Let's talk to Bloomberg's Andreas Kluth. Andreas, what do we know at this point and tie that in to your reflections as to the risks around Moscow and the calculations from Putin when it comes to potentially sabotaging European infrastructure? As far as the new incidents at the in the Polish pipeline, we know nothing or at least I don't know anything and that's part of the nature of hybrid warfare which Putin is an expert in which he's been perfecting his AKGB trained warlord who's been practicing hybrid warfare for many years and is clearly increasing them now. But it's in the nature of warfare that you that it's ambiguous fighting, that it's hard to have the normal attribution that you'd have on a battlefield and so we get and we'll get an increasing number of very suspicious incidents. You mentioned the train outage over the weekend in Germany, you know when two cables, hundreds of miles apart were cut simultaneously, one on the back up for the other. There have been the explosions under the Baltic Sea for the Nord Stream pipelines. There were cyber attacks against US airports yesterday and now there's this Polish pipeline and there will be more. I think we can expect, we should expect that our satellites will start behaving strangely or GPS systems could go down that they'll be power outages. And this goes alongside years and now increasing amounts of disinformation, the seeding of conspiracy theories and maturian candidates and of course everything up to little green men and the full, full on official military thing and this is what we call hybrid warfare. And Putin as a master of this, we know he's doing it. Nature has since 2016 had a policy that in certain instances, Article 5, at Attack on One, as an attack on all, could be invoked in response to hybrid warfare too. I think we're getting uncomfortably close to that but I think we should be on an oil illusion that he's doing this even if each individual incident is almost impossible at least in the short term to prove the connection. Right. So Andreas, first of all, what could this mean for Europe's energy security but is there also any way that the West can protect themselves for such small attacks? Sure, energy security, Europe's energy is not secure and hasn't been. We're flailing and we're doing our best, okay. In terms of what the West can do to prepare. First of all, the West can stay united. It can NATO, NATO and the West, we know Putin's vulnerabilities too. We can play the game of hybrid warfare too. So it's not an all against nothing that he does hybrid warfare against us and we have to, in one step, escalate to essentially World War III scenario where we retaliate, it can be covert in both directions. These plans are underway. They're being war-gamed and we have to be very careful with the escalation ladders right now. But the West can defend itself. By the way, NATO has already doubled, I believe, the presence on the North and Baltic seas because there are lots of other cables from Internet data to electricity to gas there and they're very vulnerable. But there's not, at the end of the day, it's happening and we have to be prepared for more of it. Okay, Bloomberg opinions and Dress, a clothe with a very oppressive piece out early this week on the infrastructure challenges.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2079,2022-10-12 07:50:09
13854," with a very oppressive piece out early this week on the infrastructure challenges, the potential risks with that analysis. Thank you, Andreas. Coming up, the Bank of England stands firm saying its emergency intervention will end on Friday despite conflicting reports will analyse what that means for a deal. For the moment, UK GILDS are falling as the B O E once again confirms that the end of Bond buying is this Friday. This is Bloomberg. The Bank of England stands firm saying its emergency intervention will end on Friday. The Bank of England stands firm saying its emergency intervention will end on Friday. The Bank of England stands firm saying its emergency intervention will end on Friday. Soaring energy prices and a short supply of key chemicals that produce synthetic fertilizers are sending peak cow and horsemen your prices soaring. Even human waste is in demand as farmers hunt for alternatives. Fertiliser helps increase crop yields. You can see how much moisture is held into this. It's a lot of organic material into the compressor, breaks down the manure and the straw breaks down into a friable mix that can be mixed into your soil in the ground and for growing a whole range of different vegetables. The nutrients in the water really increases the the kind of bite and the crore-fold of the soil. The recent price spike could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. Welcome back to the Open. We're 51 minutes into the European trading day. This is a picture for equities but it's all really happening in guilds. It's all happening in sterling guilds definitely on the move. UK guilds falling, the BOE just moments ago confirming that they will still bond by on Friday. It's reiterated its plans to actually finish this on Friday despite the conflicting report that it could be extended. Joining us now is our guild guru. He is ven-round from our markets. Thank you so much for all the time. You take to explain to us exactly what's going on in the guild markets. We talk about a huge mistake, one of the biggest gaps in central bank history from the Bank of England. Is this because they want to end this bond purchasing on Friday or could it be that they think the market can handle this three days to go and they can work through this? I think it's a latter, Francine, but I don't think they are reading the market right because we have seen yield surge in the past week alone and if you look at the 30-year yield which is the key metric that we need to be watching, the 30-year yield is at 4-8 heat as we speak and that is not too far away from the peak that we saw before the BOE unveiled their actions. So if the 30-year yield comes back about those levels and there is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2080,2022-10-12 07:54:13
13855," There's not too far away from the peak that we saw before the BIE unveiled their actions. So if the 30-year-old claims back about those levels and there is volatility all over again, and if the BIE is going to end their purchases this Friday, and then we've got two more weeks to go before the BIE's, could you be the BIE meeting? So it is setting the market up for yet more volatility and yet more uncertainty, which definitely is not something the central bank would wish to have. Then is it your analysis that they can actually hold the line on this, that they can really pull back on Friday or the bond vigilantes, as some describe them, actually going to force their hand, ultimately? Absolutely, Dom. I think that the market has the hub up around and all this, and I think it's for the BIE to propose what it wants, it's for the markets ultimately to dispose what the BIE says. It's not in the BIE's court anymore. It is for traders to decide whether the BIE's actions are so far insufficient. If the LDA community finds themselves in a position where their positions are not fully adjusted to the new reality, then we make it that volatility all over again, and the BIE may be forced to come back into the market, maybe not in terms of bond purchases, but they may have to do an emergency rate hike, and we know they are very reluctant to go down their path. So the BIE can't have, can't be dictating terms to the market at this point, when the market seems extremely vulnerable, they've already seen sterling pullback, they are seeing gild heels climbing higher this morning. So this is not a situation that BIE wants to find itself in. Yeah, but, Vincent, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, the courts, actually the bank having little bit of flag, and I don't know whether we should or not, really, at this point. It is, it does feel, like it's remit, is now 100% political, because of what's happened with the government and the mini budget. So is there a case for saying, actually, the banking is at, is right and saying还 is a deadline, that's it? Get your act in order. Yeah, in the business, the BIE is absolutely right. From a principle point of view, the central bank has no reason to be in the market, buying bonds at a time when it is also going on with persisting with QT and rate hikes. It sends a conflicting message about the direction of policy. But as I said, there are political ramifications to this. And it's not clear in which direction, monetary and fiscal policy are acting in the UK any more to anyone. They've got fiscal policy loosening, got monetary tightening, and now we've got the Bank of England buying bonds in the bond market. So it's all over the place and policy messaging is anything but coherent. Anything go here and then you are very coherent. Fortunately, they're not going to be able to go ahead with QT or not, sorry, with the 31st, are they? Lightly not. But I don't think the Bank of England, if the Bank of England is talking tough about holding the line on Friday, I don't see why a reason why they cannot go ahead with QT in October, at least theoretically, well from a practical standpoint, maybe they need to pause the purchases, pause the selling, I'm sorry, if this volatility continues. So it's all going to come down to this two weeks of volatility that we are going to see before the BoEs November 3rd meeting and the end of purchases. Can you end of purchases this Friday? Okay, Bloomberg's been ram walking us through the market reaction from the flip-flopping arguably from the Bank of England. Thank you very much indeed checking in on these girls. And in fact, the action is a little bit more muted now. You've got yields down by about nine basis points at the front end on the two-year currently trading at 420. A bit more action at the back end, the 30-year current at 485. That's a move higher by close to six basis points in terms of 30-year guilt's fancy. Now that's it for the European market open. Surveillance early edition is up next. I have actually an interview I'm really looking forward to and that's with the net west chair. He's Sir Howard Davies. He understands. He was also deputy governor of the Bank of England in the 90s. So he understands mortgages. He understands guilds. He probably understands also the inner workings of the Bank of England. So that's the person I'm most looking forward to speaking to a little bit later on. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2081,2022-10-12 08:00:02

This is a crucial important thing, and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its an indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.

When you're in the business of influence in Washington, information and connections are the currencies on which you rely. For knowledge you can act upon, the difference is Bloomberg Government. Welcome to Bloomberg's Reveal and Serial Edition. I'm Franstein Lacquer here in London. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Standing firm, the Bank of England, rich, rich, clients, and its emergency intervention on the bond markets on Friday. That follows uncertainty in the markets after conflicting reports over whether Governor Andrew Bailey would extend the emergency deadline, and we'll speak to the NatWest Group Chairman, Sir Howard Davies later this hour. Plus, recession risk, President Biden admits a downturn is possible. The president also says that your idea will face consequences for the OPEC output cuts. Now, first thing is, first it's all happening on the markets, and certainly all happening in the UK. Now, we did have confirmation about 20 minutes ago that the Bank of England will go ahead and stump bond purchases on Friday. A lot of people saying this is a mistake. It's a gap because we're not 100% sure whether the market in handle it. Others saying, look, maybe they see something out there, and it's the right time for them to work through it. The pound actually swinging to again, one, we had that financial report, also B.O.E. officials saying that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2082,2022-10-12 08:03:18
13857," out there and it's the right time for them to work through it. The pound actually swinging to again, one we had that financial report also, BOE officials saying that they could be a lot more flexible. So for the moment, Sterling actually at 109.80. The UK 30 year yield, remember this is the reason why we had quite a lot of movement and worries about margin calls on pension funds currently at 4878 dollar index. It is also dollar strength story. And when you look at European stocks are pretty much unchanged, maybe a little bit on the lower side. S&P 500 futures gaining some 410s of 8%. But I would really watch these two things very, very closely. When it comes to European map, we're seeing quite a lot of red on the screen. I was looking at the industry groups that make up the 19 S&P 600. And there is almost losses across the board with, for example, the FTSE down 210s of 8%. So the Bank of England has confirmed an end to the bond buying program on Friday in an emailed statement. That's after the FT reported this morning that central bank was privately signalling to bankers that it may extend buying yields. Now the governor Andrew Bailey spoke in Washington yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Joining us now is Dan Hansen. He's senior UK economist at Bloomberg Economics and Christina Kino from our markets team. So thank you both for joining us. Christina, I mean the markets were really whipsides as we try and understand what the Bank of England is trying to tell us. And it's clear that now they want the program to end on Friday. Is that a mistake or do they actually think the market can work through this? Well, Francine, I think as we've spoken about before, the mistake here is probably delivering that absolute message that they are definitively ending it. Because as you mentioned, we don't know the market can handle it. And what happens if in fact they need to you turn back on themselves and say, actually hang on, we're going to have to do a round of intervention or maybe extend this current one. And you know, that all really just goes back to the question of can a markets trust the BUE to ease at least the acute and imminent pressures that we're seeing in the market. So this sort of development recently, it seems like more and more of the answer is maybe no. Yeah, and this is a market perspective, but done from a purely economics perspective. So it's also Bank of England saying like, look, we've become now very political because this bond route was basically started by the mini budget. And it feels affically difficult to keep on buying bonds when you're raising interest rates. Is that the message that they're trying to get back on? Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely right. So I think what the bank is trying to see a clear of is linking what it's doing to this fiscal statement that we've got on the 31st of October in particular. And we've got that date as well as key investors' minds because that's when the bank has said it's going to start QT, active guilt sales as well. So there's a lot going on at the moment. And I think Bailey, one thing that is on his mind is to this idea that monetary fiscal interaction, fiscal dominance, but also, in fact, that we're doing, he's doing this and the bank of England is doing this QE. And it's pushing against the idea of reigning an inflation. They're doing QE, but they want to raise interest rates as well. And that's really just within the bank for getting the fiscal side. That's a big tension that he's trying to step away from. I mean, if we take a step back, what's the role of central banks? I know that, again, this is called a GAF and it kind of brings us back to what Christine Lagarde, you know, made that GAF and saying, we're not here to close bond spreads. But is it, you know, they look at financial stability, they look at that 2% inflation targets, should they be really worried about the bond market right now and keep the option open because it doesn't focus the mind of bond traders? Yeah, I think that really is it. The kind of like focusing the markets on whatever it is that they're trying to achieve at this particular point in time. I mean, as Dan was saying, the overall trajectory and the ultimate goal of the BUE was meant to be fighting inflation and they were on that path with the multiple rate rises that we're seeing and probably are about to see. But then there's a sudden kind of shift towards the financial stability issue, which is more kind of in your face and more acute, but that's also part of their responsibility to address. But again, Governor Bailey was very insistent. This is temporary. Don't go to the ER�� to pay the rent",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2083,2022-10-12 08:07:51
13858," in your face and more acute, but that's also part of their responsibility to address. But again, Governor Bailey was very insistent this is temporary. The support that they're providing is just a matter of whether bond markets are kind of, you know, do they have the same definition of temporary? I suppose the big question. But Dan, at the end of the day, are they there to kind of help out bond markets no matter what? Well, I mean, I think he also said yes and no. I mean, in the sense of the financial stability intervention that they've done, it's very specific. It's meant to be very targeted. He's come out and said they were looking to come up with a targeted measure, but they just couldn't. So they've gone with this blanket approach. But ultimately, the bank is trying to transmit its policy through the bond market to the real economy. So there is a bit, they've obviously got massive skin in the game with this. I just think what Bailey has said is that he's trying to draw this very fine line between monetary policy intervention through QE, which is blanket buying a bond to get to a big target of bonds and this very specific intervention that he deems necessary. But also, thinks needs to end sooner rather than later and they need to get out of the market. I mean, you said something that really struck me last time. Maybe they're seeing something that we don't, right? Maybe they do think because they have, you know, they're finger on the pulse we hope on what bond traders are doing. They think that the pension funds can handle this. Yeah. I mean, I think if you look at the press notice yesterday, they made a point that the liquidity position of pension funds and LDIs in particular has improved. And I think they feel, or they may have been seeing this improvement there that they feel that Friday is okay for them to step out. I mean, the big thing, and Christine mentioned there, the big thing here is that it may not be LDIs that blow up next. It may be some other pocket of instability that breaks out. So I think there is something to be said for them on Friday, giving a calming message saying, look, we're exiting, but we're here if something blows up again, we're going to be here. And I think that's the probably the path of least resistance, at least for markets. Christine, I mean, the other story is actually Columbia Threaddietl, halting these withdrawals from a UK property funds, about 450 million pounds. Is that significant? Well, I suppose it's significant in the sense of this is the spiral effect that we're seeing, right, as an effect of the initial LDI crunch that we saw a couple of weeks ago. And, you know, the lies from our asset management reporter very much ringing true. Now we're seeing kind of this ripple effect of various asset sales rippling across the UK markets. And what is that going to do? I mean, damn mention again, it may not be specifically one pension fund blowing up, but then what is that going to look like in other ways? You know, we could see mass just declines in various asset prices, whether it's, you know, in public markets or as you mentioned, you know, some of these like property funds, very specific assets or alternative asset funds. We just don't know at this point, but there is that danger of the ripple effect that could once again put the focus back on financial stability. And then the bank is getting so much flak today, really from everyone I mean, I think Governor Bail is also in the front page of the Guardian saying like kind of what are you doing? What are you thinking right now? They were the first central bank to come out and saying, you know, five quarters of protected recession is possible. They were very upfront about the risks in the markets and certainly they kind of warned the government of what we could be facing. When do we know whether this was a good or bad thing? You need to let it play out first or on Friday, do we say actually this wasn't a mistake? No, I mean, I think the real interaction here was with the government and what they say on the fiscal side. So it might be that it looks like a stroke of genius come the 31st of October. If the government manages and it's a tool last to set out a credible fiscal plan. But I think what people are really worried about, markets in particular are worried about, is that two-week period that we've got between the 14th and the 31st. And that's where I think there's just this desire to have a bit more of a backstop from the bank rather than then just exiting stage left and saying that's the end of it. So I think this could look like a success. It really could, but it really hangs just as much on the government that it does on the bank of England and that's really where the buck stops because all of this remember is stems from the mini budget and that's what needs to the fiscal plan and the path of fiscal policy and a sustainable fiscal plan needs to be set out. And if that comes then things should, should calm down. Okay, such a good point. So thank you both for joining us.

13859," Then things should calm down. from the market's team. The co-head of European private equity at KKR about why he's still optimistic about the sector. This is Bloomberg. The company is now getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it. Because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not be fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? All street prepares for the latest read on inflation. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still sticky. US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed. The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation in focus Thursday on Bloomberg. Economics, Finance, Politics, this is Bloomberg surveillance early edition and from St. Lacquer here in London. Now let's talk about the private equity space. Investment from KKR reports 491 billion assets under management. The US company says its European private equity division has deployed $5.5 billion so far this year. My next guest does not believe this is the worst time for private equity. I'm very pleased to be joined by Philip Pyser, the co-head of European private equity at KKR. Philip, what a day to come on. I was going to like how do you go on UK investments and actually whether so you have a very clear strategic plan and what you want to buy. A lot of it is family owned partnerships across Europe with all of this mess in the UK. Does it make you more likely or less likely to invest here? First of all, good morning, friends. Good morning. Great to see you on a to multistay like this. It is instructive to have invested for 21 years including great financial crisis. Because what we do is not look for the short term but to really think about 5 to 10 year horizons and as Warren Buffett says at times like this of disruption, you can find great opportunity. So we are constructive at this time. I mean, would you link this to the financial crisis? I guess what we don't know is that fairly boring parts of the markets. Something of like pension funds 30 years. I mean it's meant to be boring Philip. I don't exactly 100% know what happened last two weeks. But you have these pockets of risks coming up where we list expected. What's interesting is since the great financial crisis we have had one period of accommodating monetary and fiscal policy. That's changing now and that will not be reversed. So this is a new era where accommodation is withdrawn. At the same time we have a significant event like Ukraine. So we are in unsharted territory in that sense. So what does it mean for you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2085,2022-10-12 08:16:09
13860," This is a new era where accommodation is withdrawn. At the same time, we have a significant event like Ukraine. So we are in unsharted territory, in that sense. So what does it mean for your investment? So if you look at the UK again, there's a cross-saving crisis. I don't know whether it means that certain companies will be distressed and it means that you could come in and restructure or consolidate or whether you just need to see this play out first. So this is a time of maximum uncertainty for many businesses. In Europe, what we have done over the last 15 years in 80% of all of our transactions, we have actually partnered with either family companies or corporates or entrepreneurs to help them navigate through that uncertainty with a truly global platform that KKR has and a toolkit that helps them become more international, in fact, cope with this energy transition crisis and become more technologically orientated, which is a big focus in Europe. So this is the time to partner with us and do this. But would you speak to some of the founders or to the executives? What's their number one worry? So I've been speaking to a couple of people and they say, look, yes, it's a cost-loving crisis, it's inflation, supply chains, but actually they don't have enough staff. It's difficult to employ people for the roles they're looking for. Well, that's an excellent point. If you think about what Elon Musk says, the largest issue we all have is demographic change. So if you think about the fact that in 2050, one-six of the world's population will be older than 65 years old and in Germany by 2030, we lose 5 million jobs because of that demographic change. It means we are through this secular change, which KKR is investing behind. So aging societies opens many opportunities in healthcare, but also in technology. If you look at step-stone, which is actually springing us largest division, that's exactly what we are investing behind. How much money do you have to spend in the next two years? Well, as a firm, globally, we have $115 billion of dry powder. As you have noted here in Europe, we really leaned in doing COVID, where we invested 6 billion. 21, we drenched a bit because we saw the markets getting really expensive, 3 billion. So far this year, we've invested 5 billion. And we continue looking for opportunities. I mean, to strong dollar help you, actually, we have these quirky stories about Americans buying lecture apartments in Paris. Does it help you if you can bring money over here? So as a macro point, Europe has never been more attractive in our view, now is the time to invest. That's a bull call. But it's not because of the currencies. We are long-term investors. We are not currency speculators. But it's because of that disruption I described. Now is the time to partner with families and transform their companies. And of course, valuations have come down. What's the biggest mistake of family and companies, which I'd like to remind all of our international viewers, I mean, they can be quite big in Europe. I mean, these are sizeable conglomerates. Is it that they're under invested? Is that they're not expanding enough? Is it their international strategy or something else? First of all, they're the betrock of the European economy. If you think about Germany, for instance. The middle start. Exactly. We have three times more family, large family companies relative to GDP than the US. And they're long-term investors. So in many respects, they are like, what we do. We think about investments over five to 10 year horizons. What you cannot expect from them, given they have been here for centuries, is to really be at the height of what's happening in the world. Technology, life sciences, energy transition. So the knowledge that we have globally is something we can help bring to these European family companies. So do you think there'll be more companies like that looking to private equity because interest rates are going up? And so the cost of funding is more expensive. Overall, this is a big trend. If you think about private equity today, it's not buying companies necessarily. It's really helping them solve problems. In addition to that secular trend, yes, the current market environment means that capital, especially in the capital markets, is much harder to raise. So as a result of that, private equity plays a larger role with this regard. Yeah. So we're just getting some breaking news out of Haskell of the Bank of England. We were expecting actually quite a lot of bank of England officials to speak today. And so it gives a bit more clues. But he's saying that he will not speak about monetary policy today. You're a huge opera fan. I mean, if you look at the UK, what kind of opera does it remind you of? That's a trick question on a Wednesday. First of all, it's important as an investor to have balance. I really encourage everybody who does this job to have something that creates passion in their lives.

13861," First of all, it's important as an investor to have balance. I really encourage everybody who does this job to have something that creates passion in their lives. For me, that has always been music. Richard Wagner says, imagination creates reality. You think about investing is imagining the future. So I get lots of inspiration from that. In terms of the current situation, Ryan Gold is a good comparison. I like that. We're going to start it over to the Bank of England. Okay, that's fabulous. Philip, thank you so much for joining us. Philip Reiser, they're co-head of European private equity at KKR. Coming up, NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels. As you create, continues to suffer at the hands of Russia. So we'll be hearing from the Latvian defense minister, the Amos Gadelson. That's coming up next. This is Berlin, INGM 20 morgen. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. What we want from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries.

I'm NATO defense ministers, our gathering in Brussels for two-day meeting. As Ukraine calls for more military equipment, following a series of deadly missile strikes for Russia. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Yenostolton Berg warned this is a crucial time for transatlantic security and reiterated the alliance stands by Ukraine. Enough more, we go to our reporter Maria Tadeo, who is of course following the meeting at NATO, who's also joined by Minister Maria over to you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2087,2022-10-12 08:24:57
13862," stands by Ukraine. Now, for more, we go to our reporter Maria Tadeo, who is of course following the meeting at NATO, who's also joined by a minister. Maria, over to you. Maria, over to you. Yes, friends, good morning. And of course, the word here, the NATO headquarters, is escalation after a very terrible week for Ukraine. And to talk about this, we're joined by Yanis Garrison, who is the state secretary for defense for Latvia and serve. We look at the choreography here. We've had the Nordstrom explosions, then you have a black Monday for Ukraine, eight to four missiles were launched against this country Monday. And today the Polish say we've detected a leak in an oil pipeline. In your view, are we now in a form of hybrid war, even here in the West? Well, I would say on that day, when President Putin announced mobilization and he's all a strategy from that point of view, it's escalation strategy. And I think we have to count that there will be even more escalation. And therefore, I would certainly see all actions taken by Russia on that kind of escalatory track. Therefore, also, threatening nuclear weapons, the use of nuclear weapons in part of that. But that is probably the ultimate tool that Mr. Putin can use. He's been blackmailing, I would put this nuclear blackmailing for quite a time. Therefore, before he gets to this nuclear issue, I would say we will see most likely analysis escalations and they would be most likely in hybrid terms. And we have to look very carefully on our critical infrastructure. You mentioned escalation and potentially attacks on critical infrastructure. So that means, well, the pipelines and anything that has to do potential with internet, telecoms, communications, but I wonder just to make it very clear, if that were to happen, and you look at Article 5 of NATO, how does NATO respond to this? Because Article 5 does not make a reference to infrastructure. Well, I think Article 5 is political issue and the decision will be taken on case-by-case basis. I've seen the evolution of Article 5, specifically, for example, the cyber. NATO stated very clearly that there might be cases when a cyber attack is viewed as Article 5. And therefore, I certainly would see also that there might be cases when vital interests of states are certain NATO states are threatened and NATO can step in in protecting interest. And therefore, I would look also very carefully on resilience, how we can strengthen resilience on our critical infrastructure. And also, as Vinta is coming, it's very clear that Putin's strategy is actually to harm Europe as much as possible when it comes to energy. And this probably is his last option to change European views on Ukraine. And that's a very good point as we head into the winter, the idea that pressure is going up. I think it's very clear what you say is you would not be surprised to see if from now to the winter there's pipelines that no longer work. There's perhaps explosions that nobody knows where they come from. That's essentially what you mean. Yes, because that, as I said, it's from our perspective that it's the only way how Mr. Putin can affect this situation and turn it into his own favor. Because we don't think that he might change any views of Ukraine because they are very determined. And he can't change most likely the situation in front also with big mobilization because we see that troops are not trained. Exactly. Therefore, the only way actually how he can change the situation is cut Western supplies. And how you can do it actually to effect in public mode. And I think the coming winter is probably lack of a source of NATO Europeans. And can I ask you, a lot of the words here or the word that gets repeated in the mode is that Russia has now chosen escalation on Ukraine. He's gone down the path of escalation. That means Ukraine needs more weapons to defend itself. That I wonder, do you fear?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2088,2022-10-12 08:29:12
13863," has now chosen escalation on Ukraine. He has gone down the path of escalation. That means Ukraine needs more weapons to defend itself. But I wonder, do you fear that, perversely, that is going to make things worse or is this the right thing to do? Ukraine needs more weapons, even if the fight gets tougher? No, I think generally we should not probably, that is important to discuss our strategy here at this night of ministerial. What will be our strategy towards Russia and also towards Ukraine? Because if we have any doubts about our determination to help Ukraine, the probably Russia already won, at least partially. And I would say it's been traditional Russian strategy to escalate and use this escalated threat and NATO, certain Western countries, societies, and if we decide to step back and give up our principles, that means Russia won already. Therefore, that will be only a matter of time when they will ask something else. That is how putting strategy works. And just as a final question, he has talked about nuclear saying we're not bluffing. If there is damage done to our territorial integrity to Russia, I'm not bluffing, this is not a joke. In your view, treating this very carefully, is this a real manace? And I guess the real question is, do you have the deterrence from a NATO perspective to stop this from happening? No, I think NATO has good policy and also latest NATO statins and US statments made it very clear and that deterrence work. But looking what happened or before, probably this will be his last chance. And probably it's very low possibility that he will turn to nuclear weapons. But still, I would not exclude probably 100 percent that it might not happen because we also didn't expect that he might go for full scale war, that he won for mobilization and many other things. But I think therefore it's important to have very strong deterrence strategy. Well, and of course the war did happen and unfortunately it continues. Sir, thank you so much for joining us on Bloomberg to see, I appreciate your time. And that was Yannis Garryson, the State Secretary for Defense for Latvia, Francine. Maria, thanks so much. Today, they're alive at NATO headquarters with of course a great interview talking about Ukraine and Russia. Now let's get back to our top story. The extreme volatility in the pound and UK bond market has put the country's mortgage industry under immense pressure. Now the average five-year mortgage on a fixed rate actually soared to more than 6 percent following the chancellor's fiscal plans. Now that's a high level in around 14 years. Well, my next guest is Sir Howard Davies, chairman of one of the UK's biggest lenders. Now West is also former deputy governor at the Bank of England. So, Sir, Howard, thank you for joining us. I mean, I have a million questions, first of all, on the Bank of England because frankly the markets are a little bit all over the place. Many operators saying this is a huge communication blunder from the Bank of England, but also in thought they can't end these purchases on Friday. What is going on at the bank? Gosh, that's a question surprising. I thought you'd ask me on to talk about AC Milan's latest home defeat. But if that's what you want to do. I love Chelsea, so we can also talk about football. Okay. Well, if that's what if the Bank of England considers you more, yeah, what is going on? Well, they introduced this facility which they always said was time limited. And they wanted to allow the pension funds to readjust their portfolio with these liability driven investment strategies. And I think what they are concerned about is giving the impression that they have one foot on the accelerator and another foot on the brake for a standard period of time. Because on the one hand, the monetary policy committee at one end of the corridor in the bank has said we are going to go for QT, quantitative tightening with drawing support from the market. And at the other end of the corridor, the financial policy committee, also chaired by the governor, of course, has said, well, we actually are prepared to do some buying, but they clearly define that as being related to particular market turbulence and instability. So I think what Andrew Bailey was saying last night was simply that particular scheme comes to an end. That's what it is for. Now, of course, if we have renewed turbulence, who knows, and the central bank will never say, never, we will never intervene. But that's what I think, that's how I read what they're saying at the moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2089,2022-10-12 08:33:32
13864,"...deterbulence, who knows? And the central bank will never say, never. We will never intervene. But that's what I think, that's how I read what they're saying at the moment. Are you expecting the markets just to test this? And test this and test this until the Bank of England does more? Well, let's try to unbundle what you mean by the markets. I mean, this is a fairly specific intervention designed for particular pension funds. Now, that's what he is talking about bringing to an end. And he's saying those people who are short of liquidity should use this scheme quickly. There is incidentally another scheme that has been announced, which is called the temporary expanded collateral repay facility, TCRF. They've not got great marketing people in the Bank of England, I think. But so the tech roof is open to people to post collateral with banks and the for banks in turn to post collateral at the central bank in order to get cash. So there are various routes. Now, of course, there are other market participants who are not directly affected by this, who are just looking at this and saying, look, we don't like sterling assets and we don't like the pound. And therefore, I can't rule out, and nobody can rule out the fact that there will be sort of knock on consequences in other markets. But so how, so effectively, this tool that you're mentioning without the great marketing skills is it's not really a backstop? Is it a backstop when the current backstop in on Friday runs out? But it's not necessarily for pensions. It's just for banks to be able to join too. Nobody's for clients of banks. Right. So we don't need it ourselves. But it's for our clients, if they're pension funds, we're not big in this market as it happens, but we do have some clients of that sort who could deposit collateral with us. We, in turn, deposit at the Bank of England and we can provide liquidity for them. Not been used so far, but it could be. So is there a danger in the markets over the next two weeks until we also understand what the government's plans fiscally are? And could this be a stroke of genius of the bank saying, look, we stop on Friday, because as you say, it's fairly difficult to take away with one hand and give it the other. Well, I doubt if even the governor would say this was a stroke of genius at this point because nobody knows what will happen over the next couple of weeks. I mean, you'll write to point to the fact that the key thing is some certainty about the government's fiscal policy. And we're not going to get that until the end of the month. So I fear that the next couple of weeks is going to be a bit of a rocky ride. Maybe people can hope that, as everybody gets to the IMF, the governor's already there, I'm off this afternoon. You know, that people will start to focus on global economy and big issues in the UK, we're participating in the background. That'd be nice to hope. But do you think they will or do investors shy away from the UK from this year's the come because of what we've lived through in the last month and a half? Well, we'll see. Investors are driven by the possibility of making some profit at the moment. They say many of them, UK is too uncertain. I've heard people bandy around, UK is uninvestable at the moment. It's sort of words that investors like to use. But they will look at it. But it looks as if we're having a sort of repricing of UK assets via the fall in the exchange rate. At some point, they'll be attractive to people again. But at the moment, it's a bit difficult to entice people into UK assets and we're seeing that in the fall in the equity market. When do you think the UK will be attractive again? I mean, I've heard investors say, well, this is behaving like an emerging market. I'm getting the hell out. Well, I think the key thing is whether the fiscal strategy that is produced at the end of the month is one that is credible. And then what happens to the UK economy? I mean, at the moment, we're the only one who hasn't got back to pre-crisis levels, which is unusual. Some of that Brexit, I would think. So I think there'll be two things. One, in the short round, there'll be the fiscal strategy credible. And then, secondly, is in the impending recession, which I think everybody now pretty much expects, is the UK hit worse than other people? Or do we just sort of ride down with the crowd? Do you think the credibility of the Bank of England is really at play now? Or again, they've been dragged into this political mayhem, and it's difficult to see a way out? The Bank has been played into a very difficult position, I think, as a result of this hiatus, if you like, in policy making. And so they're left holding the baby, so to speak. And so I have quite a lot of sympathy with the Bank. Maybe as a next...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2090,2022-10-12 08:38:06
13865," like in policy making and so you know they're left holding the baby so to speak and so I have quite a lot of sympathy with the Mac maybe as an ex deputy governor you expect me to say that but I do because I think they are trying to hold things together as best they can in something of a policy vacuum and that's never a great place to be for a central bank. Where do you see the UK headed economically? So you have you know very recent data at NAT West trying to understand how consumers are spending what mortgages are doing. Yes. What do you worry about the most? Well you know what one of the things that does concern me is that I think we have been talking ourselves into a worse state of mind than perhaps we are you know if you look on the good side you've still got rather full employment now some of that's to do with what's going on in the labour market she's tricky but we are still seeing people with a lot of deposits deposits in our bank went up last week I mean strangely enough we're still seeing strong spending on holidays and leisure spend is strong we're not seeing very much in the way of distress among consumer borrowers you know mortgages are still available they're at a different price which obviously is not welcome to people but they're still available. So I think we're at risk of talking ourselves into a worse position than we are you know this is not yet looking to me like a very steep and deep recession it's looking like an adjustment to a an unfavorable development in the terms of trade because energy prices have gone up significantly and we are having to adjust to that.

The owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior reported third quarter sales of fashion and leather goods up 22% on an organic basis. Now Intel is said to be planning job cuts possibly in their thousands, as it looks to lower costs and cope with weakening demand for personal computers. Bloomberg understands that Laos could be announced as early as this month, around the same time as the company's third quarter earnings. Now the US Justice Department is investigating whether Credit Suisse continued to help clients evade taxes years after it pledged to actually tackle the issue. The latest probe comes eight years after the bank paid a $2.6 billion settlement in the US. Credit Suisse denies any improper conduct and says it is cooperating with authorities. And that's your Bloomberg Business Flash Francine. Leanne, thank you so much, Leanne Garenzer, with the first world news. Now let's get straight to Sir Howard Davies, he's chairman of that West Group, to talk about mortgages, the UK, the Bank of England and of course the guilt markets. Sir Howard, thank you so much for staying with us. We were talking a little bit about some of the refunding, refinancing plans of the LBI's and pension funds. Do you worry about first of all of money going into even more into shadow banking, a space which is unregulated and is that where the next crisis coming from? Yes, I mean it's not totally unregulated because the financial stability board have done a lot of work on trying to get out the shadow banking sector via funding from regulated entities for the banks etc. But undoubtedly there is a lot of maturity transformation that goes on inside the shadow banking sector. That's inherently risky. The squeeze on banks via ever increasing capital ratios gives people an incentive to go to shadow banks for credit because it can be cheaper but of course they fund themselves frequently in relatively short term markets. So yeah, if I were at the central bank today I would be casting a BDI on those areas of the shadow banking sector that do maturity transformation and where they are dependent on short term funding. And I think you're going to see just as you've seen some marginal players in the mortgage market pulling out because their wholesale funding is not available. I think you're going to see that in other parts of shadow banking. But something actually blowing up, we have also liquid to concerns in other parts of the market. Well blowing up I suspect it's more slow puncture probably that people will just be withdrawing from the market. But I think any time you get a relatively sharp rise in interest rates which is what we're having at the moment then where you have to look is those people who are leveraged where the leverage was comfortable when interest rates were 1% but where it's not comfortable when interest rates are 5%. And that is I think shadow banking is part of that. But that's where I'd be looking as if I were the overseer of financial stability at the moment. So how are we going back to what you're seeing at that west with many of your customers and mortgages? Are you seeing any signs of distress? Not, no, not very much. But then what's important to note I think and it's not been discussed so much is the mortgage market is a very different shape today than it was the last time we had a sharp rise in interest rates which goes back way before the financial crisis. Now for us 92% of our mortgages are on fixed rate 8% are standard variable. Standard variable mortgage holder mortgage get rate goes up half a point you see it at the end of every month. For the 92% who have fixed their fixed at various different lengths on average I think it's about two years and nine months. So if you see about a third of them roll off every year. Most people will face a very sharp increase in their interest rates because they will move off a fixed rate that might be based on one and a half percent to one that might be based on 5% at the moment. So the incidence of distress will be very uneven across the market. There will be plenty of people who for the next two or three years say crisis what crisis? My mortgage payments have stayed the same because I fixed last year. But so I think it's going to be very, very unusual and we will see some signs of individuals in distress because of these jumps in the mortgage rate. But the many parts of the market will remain very calm. At what point do interest rates peak? Are we looking at 5, 6% could they go higher? And so what's the biggest danger point for the economy? Is it 18 months from now or is it real? And so I'm just standing in the case of mortgages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2092,2022-10-12 08:46:40
13867," Economy, is it 18 months from now or is it a real time? Well, interestingly, in the case of mortgages, what it seems that the turmoil has done is bring forward the rise in the long end of the curve. So we're in the unusual position where the short end, you know, the bank base rates still quite low. And yet they curve a steepened sharply, so that at 10 years, you know, you're talking at nearly at 5% in the guilt market, and of course people will price off that. So what you've seen is a very sharp rise, and therefore now fixed rates are very, that's significantly repriced. The question I don't think anyone can answer is, well, what happens as the Bank of England raises rates, which we expect, you know, the yield curve looks like that at the moment, as the bank raises rates, does it go like that, or does it go like that, as the short rate rises, but the term premium doesn't go up very much because it's... What do you think it'll do? Well, I think it'll be a bit more like that. Like flat, right? I think it'll... Because I think it's very steep at the moment. But I think if you look at real rates, you know, for the 10 year, they're now above 1%, a month ago, there were still minus 1%. Yes. So undoubtedly, you know, the long end of the curve has been repriced, and that's partly because of the turmoil in the guilt market. This also, however, will depend on how the government issues its own debt. We know they're going to issue a lot. Will they issue, continuing at very long rates, or will they sort of take advantage of the fact that the curve is the way it is, and issue more short-gilts? I think, personally, I would say that might be quite a smart move at the moment. So if you're a mortgage holder today, and I actually do get that question quite a lot from social media or people that, well, what's that? First time buyers, do you have any practical advice of what you should be looking at? Or people that don't look at finance? First time, looking at my regulator, which whom I always think over my shoulder here, I'm not registered to give financial advice to some individual. But I mean, I think what people have got to weigh up very carefully now is affordability at a different level. I mean, we stress our mortgages, obviously, at rates that are higher than their current rates. So when you come to us and ask for a mortgage, we would say, well, OK, Francine, how does this look if rates are 5% or 6%, how would your finances look? And we don't lend to you unless it looks as if you can carry on paying at that rate. So most of our mortgage portfolio is stressed at these levels of interest rates. Now, people won't like it. You'll have to spend a bit less on designer dresses when this happens. But you will, in our view, if we'd given you a mortgage, we would have given it on the basis that you could afford it. You'd have to adjust your spending a bit, but you could afford it. So we hope that given that we've been pretty prudent and most of the big banks, I think, would be the same, that this won't create too much consumer distress, but it will create some problems for people who've got their spending out of balance. But in some of the banks, I actually had to pull mortgages when we had this discrepancy in the markets. That was, didn't, is it because you're hedged and stress tests at a higher level? Yes. Well, we do have two things. One, we were quite deposit-rich at the moment, and secondly, we did hedge, and we were able to stay in the market. We thought that was the right thing to do, because there were people who were in chains and transactions that needed to take place, and it was better for them, even at a higher rate, to do that than to lose the transaction. So we felt we should stick with our customers in that way, and we had hedged in such a way that we still wrote that business at an roughly acceptable margin. We're also preparing for blackouts, from the government possibly, over the winter months. How does that West manage that? Well, that's a bit difficult for us, because we don't have any real ability, as a normal financial business, to sort of hedge against blackouts. I mean, we would have some issues. We have backup generators for our core systems, et cetera. I hope touch wood that we are reasonably well prepared for that. But I mean, I don't think a bank can really insulate itself to that degree. Sir Howard, thank you so much. As always, Sir Howard Davis, there are a term of that West group, of course, talking about housing, mortgages, GDP, and the Bank of England. Now, coming up more on our top-stories, our Governor Bailey says, the emergency support will end on-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2093,2022-10-12 08:51:10

This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with Replays All Weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of circulation fears, moment, people were talking about that all day, yesterday. Economics, Finance, Politics. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition and front scene, Lackwai here in London. So the Bank of England has reiterated its plan to end its emergency bond bank program on Friday, despite a conflicting report it could be extended. Now joining us now is Bloomberg's Van Ram from our markets like Team Van. You always make me smarter on guilds on what the Bank of England shouldn't do. Bailey talking tough, is it B-O-E really going to stand firm? Morning, Francine. It looks like the B-O-E's communication is all over the place. They've been saying at least they issued a press statement earlier this week saying that the bond purchases will end this week. And that's what really betrayed to yesterday, which the markets took notice of. Now there is also the other financial transactions reporting that they're open to extending purchases. So it's not really clear what the B-O-E is trying to do here, but it looks like from Bailey's position last night that they may have had a rethink and they may not extend bond purchases going beyond this week. And the markets are extremely nervous about it because if you look at the 30-year lead where the B-O-E has a real presence in terms of the guild auctions, the yields are up considerably today and if that keeps going then there is going to be a bit more volatility. But so what-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2094,2022-10-12 08:55:19
13869," in terms of the guild auctions, the yields are up considerably today and if that keeps going, then there is going to be a bit more volatility. But so what are we looking at, Ven? Is this like a massive gamble or just a policy mistake? It is a gamble and a policy mistake if you ask me because it's interesting in the UK or there have been a lot higher given where inflation is at this point. So but we are not even in neutral territory yet, which is an inexplicable policy lax, no matter how you look at it. I mean every other major central bank in the world is racing towards neutral or trying to get go higher than that. Even the ECB is showing a locality in getting to the neutral rate whereas the BOE has been dragging its feet and getting to neutral rate and now the market's are pricing in a terminal rate of 575. That's a light years away from where the BOE is at the moment. We are at 225. So the BOE has got plenty of plenty more to do in the cycle and it's not clear that they're willing customers to raise rates because for some reason or the other and it may be the mortgage markets that they are worried about that they are not willing to raise rates in this current cycle. From Seen? Yeah but so Ven is this trying to keep pressure? I'm trying to find some policies. Is it trying to keep pressure on the government? So we're going to have two weeks of volatility but that things could look a lot better for the UK. Absolutely. I think it does put the government on the back foot. When Quoting took over a Chancellor it looked like the Bank of England maybe made your account for its laps in controlling inflation but now the BOE looks like it's on the other foot with the Bank of England trying to tell the government look you need to clean your out of top now. So it's an interesting change of positions for the Bank of England and the and downing street and definitely the pressure will be on the government if the Bank of England is intent on ending its backdrop. Okay Ven thanks so much as always making us smarter of course on GILTS and all things bonds from our markets live team. Now Bloomberg surveillance continues in the next hour Matt Miller, Kaley Lines, our New York and Edward Stern London. The look at the Bank of England and the look at GILTS and of course the building wants to re-dominating them all. Of course there's what's happening with UK. Watch out for volatility and liquidity. This is Bloomberg. What about cryptocurrencies or are you a believer in cryptocurrencies? No I'm not a believer in cryptocurrencies and I would say that cryptocurrencies are a bubble and I would describe cryptocurrencies as a limited supply of nothing. So to the extent there's more demand than the limited supply the price would go up but to the extent the demand falls than the price would go down. There's no intrinsic value to any of the crypto currencies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2095,2022-10-12 08:59:32
13870," Why the price would go up, but to the extent the demand falls and the price would go down. There's no intrinsic value to any of the cryptocurrencies except that there's unlimited amount. Well, based on what you've just said, why would you not put a big short of some type on cryptocurrencies, or maybe you have, but do you think there's a good short? Well, you know, when we look for the subprime, the reason why we shorted the subprime and size because it was asymmetrical. You're shorting a bond at par that has a limited duration that trades at a 1% spread of treasures. You can't lose more than the spread and the duration. Yet, if it defaults, you can make the par amount. In crypto, there's this unlimited downside. So even though I could be right over the long term, in the short term is the case of Bitcoin, you know, one from 5,000 to 45,000, you know, I would be wiped out on the short side. So it should do volatile short. The difference between political gossip and policy intelligence.

I think it's this terrible pressure on the global economy. I think we are at the toughest spot, you know, in the year. We are as we're in a period of economic slowdown or deterioration. The economy is starting to go through the windshield. The financial system is starting to go through the windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. This is not just a U.S. issue. This is a global issue. Market functioning problem in the U.S. We haven't really seen it, especially when we compare it to what's happening in the UK. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early addition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lymes. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. Drama at the Bank of England investors get wit lash as the Bank of England is forced to reaffirm Bayley's warning that the central bank will end its bond buying program on Friday. NATO defense chiefs gather in Brussels to discuss weapons production and support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Joe Biden says the U.S. has gained out responses if Vladimir Putin uses a nuclear weapon. And as Biden tries to downplay the recession risk, Intel cuts back. The chipmaker is planning thousands of job cuts as a broader slowdown adds to its challenges. Welcome to Bloomberg's Bayley's early addition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lymes in New York. It is only 10 a.m. here in London. I was going to say I know it's much earlier with UK. But we have already, as I said in the headlines, got wit lash around all UK assets this morning. Yeah, back and forth, back and forth, the BOE clearly trying to push back against the financial time story that suggested that that deadline is going to be extended beyond Friday. A lot of volatility in UK markets. And of course, we've seen a lot of volatility in other markets around the world as well, just to recap what happened in Asia overnight. It was an interesting mixed session. The MSCI Asia Pacific index as a whole down about a tenth of one percent is you saw stocks just a little bit lower in Japan and Hong Kong, but really interesting action in China in the latter half of the day. Some real dip buying coming in. Maybe some bargain hunting for those really beaten down Chinese stocks. So that's all the CSI 300 actually rallying about one and a half percent. And the biggest contributor to that on an individual stock basis was CATL, which of course is the big battery company. It forecasting a big surgeon profit. So those shares up about 5 percent as a result. Finally, in foreign exchange, I just want to bring our attention to the Japanese yen. We are back at 146.32 on dollar yen. That is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2096,2022-10-12 09:03:55
13871," 5% as a result. Finally in foreign exchange, I just want to bring our attention to the Japanese yen. We are back at 146. 32 on dollar yen. That is around the levels where we saw intervention last time. The first intervention to stem weakness in the end going all the way back to 1998 that we saw several weeks ago. So it raises the question is if more intervention may be coming that something we should all keep an eye out for. Also two weeks from today, I will be going to Tokyo. Kaley, so I'm looking forward to that. Exchangerate is staying the same. Not a lot stays the same in these markets, frankly. I mean yesterday in the cash trade on the S&P, we were down, then we were up, then we were down again dramatically. And now the S&P futures are back up again. So a lot of volatility to say the least. We see the 10 year yield very little changed, but up almost at 4% at 3 spot 9268. And we did, of course, come up through 4% briefly, very briefly yesterday for only the second time this month. And you can see 9X crude is coming down. 8928, a barrel right now. So, but very little change. It'll be interesting because to watch this because President Biden has suggested consequences to Saudi Arabia for joining in the OPEC plus decision to cut 2 million barrels of production a day. He doesn't say what consequences there in the process. Apparently they hadn't thought about this before. They probably have to have meetings and figure out what to do. No one's ever gameed anything like that out before Bitcoin right now. Well, it's up 7 tens of 1% but still holding at 19159. This has been the least volatile asset that we've been watching for so long. I find that so fascinating. Will it continue to stick in this range? And then just so that we've all said it. And I want to point out that the bank of England did come out and refute the FT report that they will continue their bond buying program past Friday. They say it goes only until Friday. So let's just understand this in case they decide to extend it. Right. Okay, so this is 1003 UK time. What is it? 503 504 just about New York time will keep this story under review, but that's where we are. Right now I'm going to say the same thing and again when we look at my assets I've chosen today. We look like a bit of a mess across European stocks today. The future picture actually suggested we go higher. That's when US futures were much stronger than we didn't. We retreated at the start of the European trading day and we've clawed back some of those losses and now some of these markets look more positive. But a little bit of a messy picture and a lot of volatility in these markets as we've said. So that's equities. Let's get to the UK assets and to just recap where we have been then at the pound fell on those comments that we heard from Andrew Bailey last night where he said the skin ends on Friday pension funds. You have three days to get your houses in order. Then the FT story dropped early hours this morning and that's led to a rally in the pound. Then the pound sold off again as the Bank of England was forced to come out and reaffirm what Bailey had said last night and then the pound gained for who knows what reason because that's where we are right now 110 40 up by seven cents of 1% at the 30 year guilt yield also responding to this story. Perhaps we're seeing selling almost across the curve. Although the short end looks a little different but selling of UK. Guilt today continues with pressure on them. Of course, because of what Bailey has said with that line in the sand now being drawn 4.9% is where we have to on the 30 year yield and it was going over 5 of course initially that seemed to trigger the Bank of England to want to get involved in buying bonds. LVMH the luxury goods company 2.9% Matties look you are looking forward to going to Tokyo with your strong dollars. Well, it seems a lot of Americans have been coming to Europe with those strong dollars and buying some handbags and other luxury goods whilst they're here. LVMH doing very nicely as a result and Phillips down by 6.5% for the healthcare business. This after they had to take a non cash charge linked to writing down the good will on their sleep business but also interestingly more of a read across for other businesses because of ongoing supply chain issues. All of the handbags that you can buy in Europe, we can buy here and everywhere else in the world at every major airport. Where we go, but I'm guessing the exchange rate that helps. Yeah, I just want to point point point that out. All right, let's get more on that B.O.E. drama. Whatever it takes until Friday, a spokesperson from the Central Bank reiterated Governor Andrew Bailey's warning that the bond buying program will end on Friday. Bailey spoke at the IIF event in Washington yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done and my message to the funds involved.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2097,2022-10-12 09:08:36
13872," Bailey spoke at the IIF event in Washington yesterday. We've announced that we will be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left. Now you've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. Bloomberg's Danny Berger joins us now for more. So Bailey says they're not going to extend the program, Danny. Do markets buy it? Well, they're volatile. I don't know. It's really difficult to discern exactly how markets are interpreting this. Anna went over the timeline. And for a radio listening audience, I have a very simple chart in front of me. It's sterling over the past two days. And I mean, the chart's really wild. You see what Anna was describing. He says those comments. It falls. You get the FT story that the BOE is talked to privately with bankers that they will extend it. Pound rallies. It's still higher today. And then, of course, the UK bond market on the long end of the curve is still settling off. And that would suggest that the bond vigilantes are still out there challenging the Bank of England who only about an hour ago came out and said, a spokesperson said that they are still going to have that Friday cut off date. Matt, I would say they didn't outright deny the story. They said they wouldn't comment on the story and offer this as an aside. So do with that with you will. But look, at stake here, it's more than just a liquidity crisis. It is a crisis of credibility. And this is one of the main tools of the central banks. But I wouldn't go as far just to say that it's credibility of Andrew Bailey himself of what he says. Because to be frank, this is something all central banks are struggling with right now that they've these two primary objectives. One is to control short-term rates, manipulate central bank policy through that. And then the other is being the lender of last resort. What happens when those two goals are in direct opposition to each other? Do you danger doing one of those goals over one of the other? And that one becomes endangered? So it's something everyone is struggling with. And honestly, it seems like we're just watching the BOE try to figure that out in real time, Kayleigh. All right, Bloomberg, Danny Berger, you're going to have quite a roll of coaster ride tracking. This one I am sure. Thank you so much. Let's turn now to geopolitics. NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels as Ukraine calls for more military equipment following a series of deadly missile strikes across its territory by Russia. NATO Secretary General Yen Stoltenberg is speaking right now. He has said, among his other comments, that the ministers will be discussing Ukraine air defense. Also on the subject of nuclear weapons, he said a nuclear strike by Russia would have consequences for Russia, but they have not yet seen any changes in nuclear posture. Let's get more on this now with Maria Tadeo, who is following the meeting at NATO headquarters. Maria, nuclear aside, we have seen a dramatic escalation in the war in the past week. How will NATO allies respond? Yeah, and we've seen the bombings in Ukraine on Monday. That is what the country says was a black Monday, eight to four missiles were launched by the Russian Federation across the Ukrainian territory, the NATO Secretary General. By the way, just now, he was speaking to us reporters, seeing that this is the week of the most severe escalation in the war since it started back in February. They're going to talk about how to better help while Ukraine protected itself. They talk about air defense systems. Remember, it seems again that the nature of this war is changing from the ground to the skies. And they will also talk about how to protect critical infrastructure in NATO itself. And this is a big talking point today. We have seen the explosions in Nord Stream 1, Nord Stream 2, the Secretary General talked about sabotage. And then, of course, today, the Polish said that they detected a leak in an oil pipeline that goes through Germany. So now, this is of the utmost concern for NATO. How to deal with potentially 50-year hybrid war? Didn't the Polish suggest that they didn't find any evidence of sabotage? Well, the Polish have said they found a leak. But what NATO says is that they want to investigate everything and see the entire results of everything. And by the way, when I spoke to the Latvian defense minister, he said he would not be surprised if pipelines mysteriously, well, don't work anymore. They explode or we have issues with entering connections, with the telegram sector. A lot of this is something that they will seriously consider. Today, there has been a remarkable change in tone over the past week when I talked to my sources.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2098,2022-10-12 09:12:51
13873," Seriously consider today there has been a remarkable change in tone over the past week when I talked to my sources now and a week ago Who say this is something they now have to treat seriously? Yes, this is something that Europe is taking seriously is very ready for of course the threat of sabotage Maria You're right to point that out but the Polish government official has been saying there's no reason to think the leak is sabotage And I'm sure those saying queries are continuing. So that's NATO. That's where you are Maria Let me ask you about the G7 and how we tease planning to respond to the latest escalation we've seen this week Well, Anna it was pretty much essentially a repeat of what they need to talked about in their own statements So we talk about the collective West Well, they share a lot of the talking points here But also once again reiterate and that the G7 stands by Ukraine They also warned that anything that looks like a nuclear potentially even Will operation against the country will be met in the most severe terms, but to me the real takeaway from that statement was president Selenski this one under the radar, but yesterday he said and he described Vladimir Putin not as a Russian president But quote as he terrorists and once again repeated that at this point Ukraine does not see a room for diplomacy If you ask me that was slightly under reported, but it really is a takeaway from this a Ukrainians do not see a space for the time being in which they can engage Diplomatically with Russia. All right Maria. Thanks so much for joining us Maria today Are there live at the NATO headquarters? Meanwhile the US is speeding up shipment of two advanced air defense systems to Ukraine as Maria was just saying President Biden said in the CNN interview yesterday that the US has game-doubt responses if Vladimir Putin uses a nuclear weapon That doesn't seem like it would end well Pivoting now to the economy Biden downplayed the risk of a recession in the US saying it's possible, but any downturn would be quote very slight I don't think there will be a recession if it is there'll be a very slight recession that is we'll move down slightly Well, look think about what's happened we have done more within a better position than any of their major country in the world Yet fears of an economic stumble persist of course Intel is said to be planning job cuts possibly in the thousands as it looks to lower costs and cope with weakening demand Bloomberg understands the layoffs could be announced as early as this month Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie joins us now with more Tom yes, I'm terms of the timeline October the 27th That's when they were releasing their third quarter results and the expectation from our reporting is that those announcements around job cuts Code card on that day or around that date. So that's one to watch for the analysts expect that with those earnings They're going to announce a revenue drop of about 15 percent Multiple different pressures on Intel you've been talking about a number of them in the context of the broader tech space But I'll just run through some of the key hits to this company They're seeing their margins squeeze the competition with AMD They haven't managed to claw back some of the market share that they've lost to that company China is their biggest market You've seen of course those restrictions put in place on Friday That's a big hit to Intel as well going forward and then crucially that demand for PC processes on which Intel Depends so greatly as a key part of its sales That has been hit as well slow down significantly What you could be looking at then according to our reporting Particularly the sales and marketing group that is where the axe could fall the heaviest you could be looking at a 20% cut To jobs something of a 10.8 2016 they cut 11,000 jobs the stock is down 50% year-to-date At Bloomberg intelligence says this could lead to cost savings of between 25 and 30 billion What's if that doesn't anything to the stock price go? Yeah, it's interesting that a lot of the job cut stories we cover from the US Do seem to involve the tech industry and this in the hardware side as well as others Aton, thanks very much for that blue post on McKenzie joining us with the latest on the US economy and the jobs fall out so far Coming up on the program Ben M. and joins us managing director for global macro strategy at medley global advisors How is he navigating the the difficult waters of the UK asset classes right now and and exclusive with green light capital president David I'm more on what he thinks about the future of investing ahead Relating to value investing.

13874," I'm off. New tree genomics and precision nutrition is one of those rare scientific fields that overlaps with the Instagram friendly wellness industry. There is a lot of interest in this idea of personalized nutrition and especially how accessible it is to the public. You can go on Google and type personalized nutrition or diet and genes and you will find dozens of different companies that offer this nutrition precision tests. One of those companies is Routine. Routine claims that their personalized tests stemming from sciences like Neutrogenomics make their supplements different. But even with the claims from routine as well as dozens of other personalized nutrition companies, the science still has a long way to go. So, you need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. Everything is your minus and educate these Web acres that offer Brushts worldwide. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed. The data will power. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Next, tomorrow on Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg surveillance. Early edition on Matt Miller here in New York, at Kaley Lines, Anna Edwards out of London. Now, we are looking at a situation with UK rates where they continue to rise even after the bank of England tries to tamp them down or at least tries to stop financial instability because the rise that we saw after quasi-quart tanks, many budget, which the IMF calls a textbook case of how not to budget your country, was very fast. And now we've seen a more gradual rise. Maybe that's better, but it hasn't stopped volatility in markets. Joining us now is Lynn Thomas and Bloomberg markets managing editor. Lynn, yesterday, in fact, was a textbook case of volatility. Was this all caused by the bank of England by the guilt market? Yeah, I think a lot of it absolutely is being caused by really the chaos that's happening in the guilt market. And the fact that people don't know what the BOE is really trying to do, on one hand, they're saying they want to remove the emergency backstop. And the other hand, it seems like maybe that's not the case. OK, Lynn, just as you're speaking, we're guessing, yes, another comment from the bank of England, a bank of England spokesperson reiterating that the target in guilt buying will end on October the 14th, saying the governor made the position clear in contact with banks. This does seem to be a little bit of a pushback once again, against what was reported elsewhere in other media overnight. I mean, is this a case of the lady protesting too much, which might spring to mind, but we've talked to so many guests who just keep saying, if there is chaos in the markets, they will extend. But here they are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2100,2022-10-12 09:21:22

Material samples brought back from objects in space can shed light on billions of years of our solar system's history, including details about the origin of life here on Earth. A piece of an asteroid is a piece of the earliest beginnings of a solar system. But picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close. Probes need to land on surfaces with weak gravitational poles where the surface terrain is completely unknown, gather samples, and then make the long trip back. And while behemoths like NASA and SpaceX grab headlines, it's a relatively young space agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, better known as Jaxa, that is taking the giant leap necessary to bring the mysteries of space back down to Earth. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It's隨 wacky. Lots of bloopers. I've seen the bloopers. What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg's early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Nana Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world, here's the first word. Polish authorities say they believe a leak in an oil pipeline bringing Russian oil to Europe is probably an accident. Poland's top official in charge of strategic energy infrastructure says he has no reason to assume it was an act of sabotage. Pipeline operator PERN says it expects to know the potential causes in a few hours. European authorities are on high alert for any signs of sabotage on energy infrastructure since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in August for the second time in three months, raising the possibility that the country is now in a recession. The Office for National Statistics says the sharp three tenths of a percent drop in industrial production was the main cause of a decline. Many analysts anticipate the decline means the economy will be lucky to avoid a downturn in the third quarter. Lockdown fears in Shanghai, schools and other venues are quietly shutting down as officials trying to rain in a COVID flare-up that's hit the financial hub. Several schools dotted throughout the city have suspended in-person classes according to parents and social media posts. COVID prevention offices say they at least five districts have closed entertainment venues including Senama's bars and gyms. And the U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Credit Suisse continued to help clients evade taxes years after it pledged to tackle the issue. The latest probe comes eight years after the bank paid a $2.6 billion settlement in the U.S. Credit Suisse denies any improper conduct and says it is cooperating with authorities. But man, it is just one thing after another for Credit Suisse and that is the story we continue to follow. Yeah, we'll continue to watch it for sure. But the main concern I think is how they deal with the current liquidity issue and whether or not they have to raise capital. Yeah, absolutely. October 27th then we focus in on that. Coming up, Ben Eamon's joins us, managing director for Global Macro strategy and medley global advisors. We'll get back to some of the UK tails wagging the global market dog. Surely this is being back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2101,2022-10-12 09:29:25
13876,"laughtery. I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity that is the most successful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. I mean you really got to focus on your talent. In the past it's always been given money, you know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to work. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family, I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to a tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with their head, heart, and hands, not just head and hands, the heart has to be engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens are the community, their members of a family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee. Be an employee and be a plus to the community in the family. Mistakes are higher. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. Here's what you need to know. Drama at the Bank of England investors get whiplash as the BOE is forced to reaffirm Bayley's warning that the Central Bank will end its bond-buying program on Friday. NATO defence chiefs gather in Brussels to discuss weapons production and support for Ukraine, meanwhile Joe Biden says the US has gained out responses if Vladimir Putin uses a nuclear weapon. And as Biden tries to downplay the recession risk, Intel cuts back. The chipmaker is planning thousands of job cuts as a broader slowdown adds to its challenges. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lines here in New York. The Bank of England certainly a plenty of challenges the UK government with a few of those as well. That's the European story, but broadly the global picture looking a little bit more risk on than it did just half an hour ago. Yeah, the Bank of England seems to be trying to save the UK from the UK government. We'll see if they continue that experiment past Friday. Let's take a look what's going on in US assets, S&P futures. Right now up one solid percent. Now it should be pointed out that we were down yesterday at the beginning and then we were up in the middle of the day and then right at the end of the session we came straight back down. So a lot of volatility and we still have four hours to go until the opening bell. The 10 year yield at 391 86. Yesterday went up through 4%. I believe it did on September 28th as well. So we're kind of on 4% watch, but now coming the other way is investors buy those bonds. They're also buying crude, but only adding 49.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2102,2022-10-12 09:33:00
13877," believe it did on September 28th as well. So we're kind of on 4% watch, but now coming the other way as investors buy those bonds. They're also buying crude, but only adding 49 cents a barrel right now to 89.87. I thought that it was very interesting that President Biden said there will be consequences for Saudi Arabia, that the relationship needs to change after OPEC plus cut production by a headline two million barrels a day. So we'll see what those consequences are right now. They're apparently in process. Not clear how long it's going to take until we understand. Bitcoin, by the way, continues to remain in the range that we've seen for so long, really cally since June. I mean, it's been up to 24 and down to 17, but just hovering around 20 for the most part right now in $19,172. What do you see in the pre-market movers? Well, I want to begin with Intel, Matt, because this was a big story Bloomberg reporting yesterday that it could be cutting thousands of jobs as it attempts to rain in cost as it contends with a slow down broadly in the PC market. Interestingly, the market taking pretty kindly to that in pre-market trading this morning, maybe investors like the idea of Intel pulling back on cost because it's up about 1.5%. But of course, it also is in tandem with a broader rebound in the chip space, which has had a very painful couple of days in video, for example, down 12% with four down days in a row. It is rebounding though this morning to the tune of about 1.6% in early hours. And we're seeing broadly big tech stocks getting a lift to, as we see yields moving lower, a bit more risk sentiment as Anna was saying coming through. So Tesla and Apple are each up a little more than 1%. Kaley, let's just focus in on UK assets for a moment. We just got some new newslines just to flash them across the bottom of the screen there as Kaley was speaking. The Bank of England maintains its counter-sicklical capital buffer at 2%. The Bank of England is ready to vary that buffer rate, though, in either direction if needed. And this is a measure that they brought in post-financial crisis. A way of stabilizing the banking sector in a counter-sicklical, as the name was, suggest counter-sicklical way, so making sure that banks have enough in reserve for the tough times. So is this just a, is there any messaging behind this or just a sort of statement of what they always are able to do, which is very that buffer rate? More on that, no doubt, to come as we read through that same as in more detail. This is what we see, though, on European assets right now, the stock 600, then up by 4.10% of 1%. The 30-year yield, and it's interesting that this comments come from the Bank of England at a time when we're dealing with such volatility in UK assets. We talked about the rollercoaster in the pound. Here's the 30-year yield, 4.92%. So very close to the 5% mark, we are seeing at the long end of the curve that selling of bonds continuing and the yields going higher, but as Matt pointed out rightly earlier, that rising yields has been at least slowed down by what the Bank of England has done in terms of its intervention at the long end. LVMH, then, a lot of Americans in Europe armed with very strong dollars buying up luxury goods, and that stock up by 3.2% as a result. Phillips down by 5.4%, they took a non-cash charge based on a write-down of the goodwill of their sleep business, also, though, interestingly for other companies talking about supply chain disruptions, Matt, that are still ongoing. All right, we're going to talk more about this right now with Ben Emmons, managing director for Global Macro Strategy at Medlow. Medly Global Advisors, he's in the office with us in the studio, Upper Erly Ben. Great to have you here. Thanks for joining us. Before we get to the world's largest economy suffering a fool in the shower, possibly, let's talk about what an IMF official yesterday described as, the British economy is a car, and it's got two drivers, each with a steering wheel, one, of course, being quasi-quartang and the other one being Andrew Bailey. What do you think about the B.O.E. bailing out the British government, and how long will it last? Yeah, Matt, it looks like it's a really close window because we were talking about, right? So he's put the pension system on, basically, a time alert saying, you gotta get this done, which I think he really is saying, like, he probably have insight on how much hedging is in these LDI derivatives, and how much selling needs to be happening. And then that's it, right? They close it off because the economy is falling in a recession, which ironically, actually would need quantitative easing, but there are- Which this is, essentially. Which this is indeed, because she's lowering long-term interest rates, and she's adding liquidity to the system, but it is a situation of an inflation that's completely out of control, so they gotta do that work. And I think this is why they're standing pat and wanna say, look, you don't have much more time, we're just gonna continue with quantitative easing. Okay, I'm put-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2103,2022-10-12 09:37:55
13878," They got to do that work and I think this is why the standing path. I want to say, look, you don't have much more time. We're just going to continue with quantitative easing. Right. And we've heard a few lines this morning. Good to see you, Ben, from the Bank of England. I mentioned some of them around the counter-sicklicor buffer. They're giving us the results of one of their meetings over at the B-O-E, saying the deadline has been made absolutely clear to banks. So once again, reiterating that the deadline stands on Friday and they want LDI funds to be better prepared for future stresses. So they're certainly putting that line in the sand. What is the peril of putting that line in the sand, Ben? What is the risk attached with saying on Friday, the Bank of England steps back? So this morning, and there was a story out in Wolsey Journal about that actually pension funds in the UK have been selling collateralized loan obligations to meet their margin requirements on those derivatives. And that's the segment of our markets that's illiquid, right? And that could continue. So there's one of that consequences of that that has a spillover effect to other markets, like collateral loan obligations that then spill into the equity markets and cause friction. The other one, of course, is we're closely watching is what will the pound do? If it does lead to a crash of the pound, then you do get a confidence crisis. So it is really a knife at situation. I think to Matt's description of two people in the car, both at steering wheel, both on a pull-edge or a steering wheel, I think is that that analogy of like you really having for this cliff if you follow this action. Well, and we can talk about the two people steering the car in terms of fiscal and monetary policy. But there is also what central banks are attempting to message and do and what the market response is. You can call them vigilantes maybe what we've seen in the UK bond market over the last several weeks. And even here in the US, the Federal Reserve continually says, once we get up to terminal, we are staying there. If you're betting on cuts next year, it's too early and the market still is sticking by the fact that it thinks the Fed is wrong. I mean, where is the credibility of these central banks right now? It's still in deficit, Galey. It's not really getting the traction from the markets and saying, you really truly are ahead of this problem. You were too late, as everybody has concluded. And you have to ratchet up even more. I'd like in it sort of what the Bank of Brazil has been doing far more ahead of any other central bank. They keep going until they make absolutely certain that they get inflation on the control. And that's what these central banks are signaling, they're not. They want to ratchet up to a level and then stop. So at a markets challenging that say, if you do that, you're not getting the situation on the control and you would have to reverse to cuts or getting the strange situation that we're seeing in the UK. Which makes matters worse. So I think this is the tension that we're going to stay in until it's fleshed out. But the concern is that something breaks, right? We've heard L-Arian criticize the Fed again. We've heard Larry Summers say that maybe they'll be able to deal with it. But to get back to an analogy that maybe all of us have heard too much, but I still love so much. Milton Friedman's fool in the shower. When the water's too cold, you turn on the hot water all the way, not realizing that it takes a while for that heat to come out. And then you burn yourself. Is the Fed risking burning the American economy? That's certainly a risk because it's freezing, as it may be. Right. You know, that is, of course, a risk map because it's been a history of tightening that had that negative effect on the economy. It spills over and to little brainer at speech, G-Ready is making this point of saying, it's already coming through. It's starting to happen. So pushing it harder, obviously, it's going to affect the economy. I think though that this idea of adding hot water to when the water's still cold, you know, Milton Friedman said, do it with a dosing. I do it at certain stages. Not front loading. It's never-deaf-five basis points for meeting. Right. And that is what the market is. Those, of course, constantly trying to trade here. You are going to have, at some point, to very quickly shift to a slower pace of tightening because the slowdown is getting accelerated. So that's the other tension I think in the market that is the pivot trade that's hanging. Well, and of course, the market is so focused on macro policy right now and for good reason. But we're about to get a whole lot of micro. JP Morgan's going to kick off earnings season, come Friday. What do you think that micro picture is going to tell us on an individual company level? And what ultimately will that mean for the equity market? The earnings no longer are able to hang in there. Yeah, and then you shift the attention really to the profit margins because there's where I think the pressure will be, where inflation is coming through, all the costs are coming through and these margins start to shrink. That has not happened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2104,2022-10-12 09:42:09
13879," Because there's where I think the pressure will be where inflation is coming through, all the costs are coming through and these margins start to shrink. That has not happened yet. All the data shows that we haven't rolled really over there. I think and the analyst expectations haven't for now adjusted there either. So that's going to be the sticker shark I think coming out of these earnings. It's not the top line EPS, it's the margins. Yeah, and here in Europe that manifests as vulnerability around higher interest rates, banks and real estate, the worst performing sectors just today in these markets. Ben, thanks so much for joining us. Ben Emmens of Medley Global Advisors. Coming up on the programme, have we seen the death of value investing? Part of our exclusive interview with Greenlight Capital President David Einhorn. That's next, this is Blaineback. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy, but could be significantly more impactful. Containershiping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. This is Bloomberg surveillance. Early edition, I'm Matt Miller, Kaley Lines, in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now, hedge fund manager David Einhorn says he doesn't know if value investing will ever be in vogue again. He spoke with Bloomberg, Shunali Bastic, exclusively on the sidelines of the Robin Hood Investors Conference yesterday. Relating to value investing, I don't know that it ever comes back. There have been serious changes to the market structure, and pretty much most of the value investors have been put out of business. So, if value investing is trying to do security analysis, think about what companies are worth, think about why they might be misvalued or misunderstood, and then do valuation analysis that tells you that that in fact is true, there's just very few of us left. Most market participants these days, they either cannot do value, they're just not trained or experienced in knowing how to do valuations, or their structure doesn't allow them to, like if they're an index fund or a passive thing, the last thing you're doing is value, or their system is a quantitative system or a trading system or an algorithmic system, and or your style is to just buy things that have charts that go up into the right, and none of those participants are really doing value. So, it used to be,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2105,2022-10-12 09:45:54
13880," things that have charts that go up into the right, right? And none of those participants are really doing value. So it used to be, you know, that on every conference call of every company, there were like dozens of analysts from all of these competing, long-only, hedge fund, long-short people and stuff like that, trying to hear what companies were doing and saying and trying to figure it out. And those staffs have been gutted because the world is move passive. And so there's just a lot less competition for what we do. Well, what does that mean for how you operate as an investor? If you're saying that so much of the world has turned passive or quantitative, has that made your job fundamentally different as somebody who picks specific securities? It absolutely does. It used to be we could buy something at a reasonably low multiple, whatever we thought that was. Think that the company would do somewhat better, benefit from it being somewhat better, and realize that other investors would see what we saw six months later, a year later, and would re-rate the shares. So you could buy something 11 times earnings, and maybe they would earn 10% more, but you'd get another three points on the multiple, and you'd make 50% over two or three years. That isn't happening anymore because there's nobody to notice what actually happens at these companies. So we have to be, the other side of that is, is nobody knows what anything is worth. So there's an enormous number of companies that are dramatically misvalued in ways that we haven't seen before. So it's whereas before, we might pay eight times, or nine times, or 12 times, which seem like low multiples. But now we can buy a lot of those same companies at three times earnings, or four times earnings. And if they're buying back 10 or 15 or 20, or 40% of their stock, in some cases, eventually we're gonna have to get paid by the company as opposed to having other investors figure out what we thought we figured out before them. That was David Einhorn speaking exclusively with Bloomberg, Sionali Bassa, who was up early, after a big day yesterday joining us on set here in New York, Sionali, it wasn't just David Einhorn, you got to speak with you. We're at that Robin Hood Investors conference yesterday. Also, there was the Greenwich Economic Forum. I mean, other than perhaps the death of, and that to the death of value investing, what were some of your other takeaways from those conversations you have? I think it's really interesting to see investors navigate the world after quantitative easing and what that looks like. The throwing away of value investing was really a comment about the structural changes in the market here. Why is that interesting? Because other value investors, like Cliff Asnist, saying that value is at its best, really, premium that you're seeing here in history relative to what you're seeing, even compared to the tech bubble. So you do have some differences here, and I think what the bottom line is here is that this is not your father's market. This is, you have to really change strategies here and start to pivot and start to react to what the new market structure looks like. It looks like. It's interesting because the big take today is about just the absolute saturation in this market of long equity head funds, and they've been pretty much dead since, although still in abundance, since the great financial crisis, right? So let me give you some numbers here. Nishan Kumar really put this out very well in the big take today, and it's still a dominant strategy, but why does this matter? It's so close to being overtaken by multi-strat when I was preparing for David Ironhorn's interview. Yesterday I talked to a lot of long short managers who wanted me to really understand is the long short model dead. Here's the thing, if you look at the hedge fund index that's a track by Bloomberg, long only strategies are doing worse than long short strategies, which shows you that there's a reason to short still, and frankly a lot of people are still, David Ironhorn is net short in a lot of ways also. So there is a role to shorting here, but it is true that all the multi-strats this year, whether you're thinking the D, shaws of the world or Citadel, they're doing better than the traditional long short manager. Shenali, good morning. What struck out, what stood out to me from what you were doing yesterday, all the stories you were covering and the interviews you were doing, is the number of people talking about distressed assets being an interesting asset class at the moment that we had Barry Stern, like talking about that, Apollo's Zelda talking about that, a real focus on distress. I'm glad you brought that up too, because if we're sitting here talking about value, Anna, it's interesting whether you're a value investor in the stock market, the big debt investors that focus on value seem to find a lot more opportunity. When that comes, I think, is a huge debate. Jim Zeltor, the co-president of Apollo, said he says that a little bit further away, maybe six, 12 months further along here, but you see Barry Stern, like the Starward Capitol, мWeaимo Thelaimov, Yes. M Clouds of wheeled",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2106,2022-10-12 09:50:57
13881," Jim Zeltor, the co-president of Apollo, said he says that a little bit further away, maybe 6'12 months further along here. But you see very stern, like the Starward Capitol, really seeing opportunities right now. And again, those structural changes we were talking about really come down to the banks where they have stepped back and where guys like Barry can step in. So for me, the story, the investing story of the year is something else that Neshot has been writing about, not the long short hedge funds that perpetually disappoint, but the macro funds that are knocking it out of the park. I mean, when you think of Crispin O'Day or any of these guys that are betting against rates, they're making 200-300% returns. Yeah, so Haydhar is another one best year ever. Exactly. A lot of hope is on him. The other interesting thing about that is you had Ray Dalio speaking yesterday to David Weston, and he's telling you that a currency is all over the world are trouble. And so when you're making money in macro, it's a very complicated equation here. You can get burned really quickly. I spoke to a couple big investors yesterday who were playing around in the UK, and none of them wanted to make a lot of conviction, given the whip sign you're seeing with the narratives with the B.O.E. Or go public, right? People are old. Because it doesn't look very good if you're betting against the pound. George Soros didn't get a great reputation. So we're not there yet. It's also what I'm saying. And at least a lot of the big investors are not put that type of conviction on their trades because they've gotten burned a lot this year too. And you see that in the numbers. The yen, I would also say, is the other area people are really worried about. And back to David Einhorn, one of the things he was really worried about, he said people are a little overly focused on monetary policy, and they're not focused enough on fiscal. What he's most worried about is the systemic risk is the government balance sheets here in the United States as well as across the world. Okay. So, finally, that is really interesting. Your comments all around really on the interviews you were doing yesterday, but also on what hedge funds and others are thinking about the UK. Very interesting story. Certainly feels from here, like there's a lot of people playing around with UK assets to use your phrase. She and Ali Bassack there in New York. Now, coming up on the program, Bloomberg invest. In fact, coming up a little bit later on, Bloomberg invests New York returns in person to bring together the most influential dynamic and innovative figures in investing and markets. Today, they'll be hearing from Grace Gail CEO, Michael Sonenshine and Pantera Capital CEO, Dan Morehead joins also, among many others. Look for those interviews throughout the day. This is Blaineback. The deal was the brainchild of Apollo CEO Mark Rowan. In January, Apollo closed its $11 billion all stock merger with Athene Holding. Apollo has already owned 35% of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects them to double to about a trillion dollars by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies typically go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. Athene is a steady provider of fee income. It is grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers.

The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. It gave up its dual-class share structure and adopted a one-share, one-vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Maryott's Lenealberg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eramela at Mondelese. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. The CFO market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopold potential rises. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now a quick look at what is coming up for the rest of the day. NATO defense ministers are gathering in Brussels for a two-day meeting. We'll get USPPI data at 830 a.m. New York time. Fed minutes are due at 2 p.m. Eastern. But of course it's not just about the fair today Anna. All of our attention is on the BOE. Absolutely. A lot of focus on the BOE and continued focus on the rising yield environment. We see certainly the 30 year, 4.96% right now. Now previous bounce of trading turmoil in the UK have ended in balance sheet expansion by the Bank of England. Our market senator, Valerie Taitel, is back with us. To talk about why the BOE putting a line in the sand on ending purchases this time round is making markets nervous and we were expressing it this way earlier saying that this was a kind of they'll do whatever it takes at the moment. Or they'll do a lot at the moment but don't ask after Friday. Yes, that's right Anna. Now I wanted to look back at previous points where UK assets express some sort of EM like trading which it's come under focus a lot recently. The fact that we've had the currency weakening alongside yield rising. And this analysis was done by Brett Donnelly at Spectrum markets and he found that there were two times in the last 20 years where UK assets had this kind of move. One was in September 2009 that was during the global financial crisis when the Bank of England announced their the bank bailout excuse me. And another time was in 2016 around the political turmoil of the Brexit vote. Now for our radio audience listeners I have a chart here at GTFego. It's the timeline of the Bank of England's balance sheet and how it's expanded. Now I want to focus on these two points in the recent history where we saw this EM movement. And both of those times it was analogous with balance sheet expansion in 2008 and 2009 and in 2016, 2017. Now the whole world is really watching with baited breath if the Bank of England is really able to take the situation under control without a massive balance sheet expansion this time. Okay, really interesting chart value. Thank you for bringing it to us. Yeah, GTFego the functions you use on your Bloomberg terminal if you want to see that in detail. Say to say the market had in the past got used to relying on that backstuff from the Bank of England. That is it for early edition surveillance.

13883," Music So you build a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government, if the president called you to serve our country, would you go into government, or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. We started out just as a start out consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in a job, then you should quit. And frankly, when people leave 23 me, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like, I want to build out a true consumer-empowered healthcare world, one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. Today with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow. This question is like does a Fed blink? I don't think it will. How do you explain to markets in the public that you still have resolve in fighting inflation if you're slowing down rate heights? Instead inflation got out of control, and now they need to really get it under control, which is going to be a process. The Fed have got a domestically focused mandate. Market functioning problem in the US. We haven't really seen it, especially when we compare it to what's happening in the UK. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Life from New York City for our audience worldwide. Good morning. Good morning. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio alongside Lisa Bramisin, Tom Keane. I'm Jonathan Farrow. Features just about positive this morning, up 8% of 1% Bramow, equities at new lows yesterday to your yields at new highs. People blaming the United Kingdom once more are basically saying the Bank of England might be a part of what's behind this. Nonetheless, there's a gloom, the pervasive gloom that you're hearing from pretty much everyone, even President Biden coming out and saying that the chances of recession, a smaller recession, look reasonable. And at what point does this really feed into that gloom that has already taken hold of? The Bank of England, Governor Bailey coming out yesterday and saying you've got three days, the financial times reporting that maybe the Bank of England had told banks that they've got more than three days and then the Bank of England comes out again and says, now, you've got three days. This is a mess. It's a mess and it's a credibility issue. And at this point, and I'm pointing to Jordan Rochester and what he said in a note this morning, if the Bank of England does reverse, that's not a positive for the pound. At this point, the lack of credibility, the lack of consistent messaging and the lack of sort of any cohesive plan of what they're trying to do. Yes, they don't want to necessarily cap yields, but they don't want financial instability. Define the two. It's a mess. Let's work through this price action for you. It's not that messy this morning. Futures are up by around about eight cents of 1% on ESNP, yield to go and nowhere at $394.32 on a 10 year Euro dollar unchanged at 9707 yesterday, Muhammad Alierean.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2109,2022-10-12 10:03:34

Yesterday, Muhammad Ali and turned around on this program and said that the IMF meetings this week will have a 2008-like feel to it. TK, you're down at those IMF meetings this week. Walk us through what's coming up. John, this is an extraordinary moment here for the World Bank. The IMF as well, and we'll talk here to their people today. But far more, it's about the international monetary fund. John, as you mentioned, it is without question the most important meetings, the most tense meetings since 2008. What I would note, John, is the data shows up right on time with Yen going out to 146, many strategists modeling a week Yen out to 150. And critically, John, as you mentioned, the United Kingdom, a complete total mess. There was one point yesterday, John, where I looked at three British newspapers, and they had three different headlines about what Governor Bailey's going to do. Tom and I have got some great guests coming up later and we're looking forward to hearing from you with Lisa, just an absolute mess for so many people of this Bank of England. The worry for me, I think the governor at the moment in this Bank of England is overly concerned about contributing to perceived fiscal dominance. The idea that they'll just focus on accommodating the fiscal effort of this government at the expense of tackling inflation. That's problematic. It's also problematic to think that the pension funds can remedy their issues, their structural issues that have been built over a decade in a matter of days or a couple of weeks. And this really creates the real rock at a hard place that the Bank of England is between if they're trying to talk financial stability on one hand and they don't want to necessarily cap yields to your point, they don't want to be basically facilitators for a budget. How do they do that at a time when they are really on the break of financial stability concerns that are pretty significant? The joining us now is Ben Leytler, the global market strategist at Eitaro. Ben, let's start with the UK. Can you help us get a better understanding of what happens if the guilt market operation of this Bank of England ends in two days' time? We basically flip from an energy crisis, which hasn't the government has sort of successfully neutralised, but in the process, they've stoked this bond market firestorm, which was exacerbated by this sort of self-inflicted misstep from the governor of the Bank of England yesterday. And this is more thing into a broader economic confidence crisis. If you're a consumer in the UK today, picking up these newspapers, looking at your mortgage rate, which is probably going to reset at some point in the next two years, and looking at all the doom and gloom that's coming, what are you going to do? You're going to do as little as possible. You're going to save as much as possible. I mean, we had economic numbers this morning, which basically show that the economy is sort of barreling towards recession, and all this doom and gloom, this doom-loop out of financial markets with bond yields now back out where they were on that in glorious September 28th day, it's just hastening the broadening this economic precipice that we're on the edge of right now. Well, Ben, talking about the economic precipice, how does this change your view of the fragility or perhaps how close we are to the culmination of some of these pressures, at least from a market perspective? So in the UK, I think support has to be extended. And I think they're sort of talking out of both sides of your mouth, needs to be resolved as soon as possible, otherwise the markets are just going to continue to push these bond yields higher, and that's going to spread contagion in the UK. But I think the real significant thing here is, you know, the world's watching. This could easily be Italy, or, you know, US-Bonnie, or 10-year bneeds now, you know, the cost was sort of 4%, I mean, this is not just a UK issue, this bond route is going global. And for markets, I think to sort of find their feeds, I think you need a sort of fire break for how high bond yields are going to go. I think you need, hopefully, some continued signs that inflation is easing. All the inflation-lead indicators are easing, but the headline inflation numbers are not. And I think that is the key. And then I think the third one would just be, hopefully, another less bad earnings season, which are on the sort of cusp of right now, to maybe just remind us that whatever bad things are, we're not at some, you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2110,2022-10-12 10:07:58
13885," Hopefully another less bad ending season, which are on the sort of cusp of right now to maybe just remind us that how bad things are. We're not at some, you know, they're not maybe quite terrible yet. They're not quite terrible yet. Does that mean that you expect them to get more terrible? Does that mean that you're sort of hunkering down in a significant portion of cash? Or are you seeing that this is sort of creating the end of a painful cycle that will create some buying opportunities? I do think the glass is sort of half full. I may sound crazy to sort of say that, but you know, I do think the fed will start desalering here, do thing over the fed or the all the inflation lead indicators are falling, even though the reported numbers, you know, are not. I do think that we're reaching the point where it's a limit to how high bond yields can go with inflation with inflation lead indicators falling with recession risks rising. And I am confident that companies can do what they did in the second quarter and just show us maybe that things aren't as bad as maybe the market's sort of pricing right now. And I think that combined that that I think allows us to begin to dig ourselves out of this of this whole that we're in right now. Ben, you're talking about the earnings of the last quarter. This is what Bank of America had to say on that. Consensus feedback from clients. The third quarter might hold up, but who cares? Garnets is going to be absolutely terrible. Ben, what would you say back to that? I don't disagree. I mean, I think this is more about the guidance and the reported earnings. So the reported earnings are going to hang on in there. But I think so far, the forward guidance, the company that we've had more people raising guidance than cutting guidance. And so again, we haven't even started yet, right? But, you know, upgrades minus downgrades or the number of companies that are improving guidance rather than cutting guidance has actually been a little bit better than you might have seen historically. So again, we'll see I agree. It's all about the future, the future, you know, it's looking, you know, it's clearly darkening. But, you know, large cap companies have shown that they've been fairly nimble, fairly resilient. And I think, you know, I think a large number of them will continue to do that. What'd you make of that, Pramo? Never mind the earnings. Let's talk about the guidance. The guidance for next year. We said how much the forecast have come down from the IMF? They've come from close to fourth for global growth in 23. Close to three. And now heading down towards two, very slowly for 23. And for advanced economies, the picture is even worse. We're talking a one-handle, potentially for GDP growth in 2023. How much visibility do you think that these companies are going to have to have to come to guidance, which basically really is issue of how helpful can this actually be? We're already getting guidance. Are we missing it? I mean, that's the big takeaway, especially with Intel yesterday, announcing thousands of job cuts. Their first big cut to their workforce going back to 2016. Aren't we already getting some signs that we're seeing real weakness, John, in terms of the actions of certain corporate players here? A Laurie Kampacina of NBC came out with new forecasts. They cut their 22 forecast, data 3,800 from 4,200. The issue a new preliminary target of 4,100 for 23. She acknowledges in the note that it's still pretty early to try and make a big call with any conviction whatsoever about next year. But said this, Ben, the forecast is driven by the idea that 12 month rebounds at a stock market off of extreme lows and sentiment are powerful. I sense that probably resonates with you, Ben. The sentiment is already completely capitulated. Valuations have come down a lot. They're below average. They're already looking for weak earnings. Earnings are going to keep drifting lower. I just don't think they're going to capitulate. And I think the Fed will decelerate the pace of rate highs. That's not pivot, but I think we're not going to keep doing 75 basis points of media. We're going to go from 75 to 50 to 25 and we're going to pause at some point in the first quarter next year. That is a big catalyst. I think you put all that together. I think the glass is sort of half full and just do the earnings. This is not all about earnings. We know the earnings are going to be dreadful. It's just a question of how dreadful. I think from here, the story flips a little bit, to become a little bit more about valuations. Bondials peak valuations are below long-term averages. I think we get some valuation relief and it's valuations that have crushed the market this year. So yes, weaker earnings, maybe not capitulated earnings, but I do expect some valuation relief coming up. I bet. Thank you. Ben.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2111,2022-10-12 10:12:18
13886," is that a crush the market this year. So yes, weaker earnings, maybe not capitulated earnings, but I do expect some valuation relief coming up. I bet thank you. Ben later that of Etoro. That's the constructive way of looking at this market, I guess, Lisa, got into next year. Okay. That was it right there. Do you think that a deceleration of rate hikes is a catalytic moment for gains in risk assets? This is actually one of the key questions right now. Ben was basically making that argument. Other people would say, well, why will they be decelerating? Will it be because there's some sort of virtuous cycle of flowing inflation? Or is this going to be something more substantial, like a real downturn? Well, I've said this a million times. If there is a positive supply side story to speak about, that brings down inflation, that allows this Fed to back away, you can make the argument that's bullish. If the Fed's pausing and we have a recession and an economy rolling over all around us, then I think you're hard push to say that's bullish. And right now when you look out at the global economy, you can see new shutdowns in Shanghai ahead of the party Congress. You can see factories idling for some of the time. It's certainly in Germany as they try to save energy. Where is the supply side response going to come from? We'll talk about the policy response in just a moment with Amber E. Holttern down in DC.

13887," When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. So in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Eating food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. Lots happening on Wall Street.

Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. I don't think there will be every session. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. That is, we will move down slightly. Well, look, think about what's happened. We have done more. We're in a better position than any other major country in the world. The president of the United States on CNN yesterday evening, live from New York City this morning, good morning, a rough ride in this equity market, the S&P 500 down for the previous five days on the S&P this morning, futures bouncing back by eight tenths of 1 percent. Yields on the US 10 year unchanged at 3.9493 in the guilt market. Anything but unchanged, the two years down eight basis points, the 10 years up nine, the 30 year is up 25 basis points right now and back through 5 percent. Closing high of the year on the 30 year guilt was 4.99 at the end of September. In today, we were higher than that, but back to five handles on a 30 year guilt. Lisa, the Bank of England operation. We've been told by the governor by the Bank of England repeatedly. It will end in a couple of days time at the end of this week. The pressure is built in maybe to extend.

What this does suggest though is that the market dysfunction has not been remedied, that a lot of these pensions have not dealt with some of the liabilities, some of their imbalances, and it's going to be a problem for the Bank of England and possibly the trust administration. 25 basis points at five-handel again on a UK 30-year yield. We'll keep you up to speed on those moves. Joining us around the table, I'm pleased to say is Bloomberg's Amory here in New York City. Alongside Maria Tadau in Brussels, MH want to start with you and talk about the comments from the President of the United States yesterday, a month away from midterms within a month now, and the pressure starting to build again. Yeah, it certainly is. I mean, the clip we just heard there was the President talking about the fact that, no, there's not going to be a recession. But as you say, a month away from the midterms, how can the President of the United States sit down and interview and say to people, yes, prepare for a recession? That's not good signaling, but he did say potentially maybe there would be. I think he was trying to hit it. Potentially, maybe, hopefully, a soft landing. But it is ramping up for him right now, right? They have four weeks, and their issue right now, of course, is they have this spat with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is how are they going to put a lid on gasoline prices? Because this still maintains the biggest issue going into the election. It's inflation. Beyond the election, it goes into next year. I think the issue I have with policy right now is it's been calibrated to tackle a near-term calendar. So basically, a short term. So you've got the policy makers in Europe focused on this winter and not thinking about what next looks like and the one after that. And you've got the administration thinking about the midterms and not thinking about what the oil market looks like in 2023. Well, welcome to Washington, D.C. Jonathan. It's a huge problem. The entire calendar is based on politics. Not only is it a huge problem in Europe, more so in the United States, but also what you see what European leaders are doing is that at the very minimum, they are trying to prepare their populations. They are shutting down the lights at the Eiffel Tower. You have the French President, Finance Minister Bruno Lamar saying, I'm going to be wearing Turtlenecks every day this winter to make sure I could start saving on heat. And then the next day, Macron shows up to a press event in a Turtleneck. You have not heard, though, that kind of rhetoric from this administration. Maybe preparing the American people, we are going to continue support Ukraine, which might mean higher gasoline prices. And that is going to be the cost to the American people want that or not. That's a big question. Maria, I toss this over to you because Enmeria is saying that over in Europe, there is a much more realistic addressing of the need to reduce some of the energy consumption. Do you think that that's true as the discussions of price caps go into effect in some sort of European continental basis at a time when there really isn't a plan to curb demand? You know, I would say to be fair to European leaders, they really do feel that this is the winter of the breakup of the rupture with Russia. This will be the biggest test because if we want to continue sanctions into next year, you have to be able to weather the storm. So they are aware that storage season for next year will be even more complicated than this year. But what they say is, I have a near term future or near term problem and I have to deal with that, especially from the public reaction. If we want to continue this pressure, we need to make sure that we get ahead in this winter. Now, the other thing when it comes to the price cap, there is an active debate. We need something on paper. Remember, the commission has been given a deadline to come up with a proposal by next week. So this time next week, October 20th and October 21st. But to add on to the headache and this goes back to NATO where I'm in today, there's a real concern and you can really feel it behind the scenes about what happens if a lot of the key infrastructure suddenly becomes damaged or there are pipelines that mysteriously go down or perhaps there are explosions or to some extent traumatize, they say, by this north-sroom one and north-sroom two, they want to figure out what happened there. So there is a real conversation about not just how we secure the supplies, but also how we keep this critical infrastructure safe and working throughout the winter. Maria, the subtext here is Vladimir Putin and what happens with Russia and their war against Ukraine. President Biden and his interview last night also called Vladimir Putin a rational actor who just miscalculated with this war. Is that basically the party line in Europe as well? Well, I think it's very difficult to second guess Vladimir Putin and everyone who's tried to second guess, but he has gotten it essentially wrong. It is right to mention and stress and highlight from the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2114,2022-10-12 10:25:25
13889," I think it's very difficult to second guess Vladimir Putin and everyone who's tried to second guess Vladimir Putin has gotten it essentially wrong. What is right to mention and stress and highlight from the United States is that their intel was spot on and the Europeans now recognize that their diagnosis was in many ways the correct one. Perhaps they were soft thinking how can he do this? There is no incentives to break up commercial relations, diplomatic relations to such an extent. They're also the response from Ukraine. They probably thought would not be as forceful as it is, but I think at this point would they repeat and again it goes back very much to that message from the US president too is that they're in it from the long haul. They will continue to stand by Ukraine and today by the way the Secretary General said with this country needs and it needs quickly now is our defense systems. We're seeing that the tactics are changing from hitting on the ground to going back to the year and pounding Ukraine from the year. So that is going to be the key takeaway from this meeting, how to provide our defense systems to this country. Maria, thank you. Maria, today I have there over in Brussels. I just want to sit on the energy story. Too often I think this is framed as a one off shock, one war, one winter. And I think for many people in the energy market it's a permanent shift away from Russian barrels away from Russian gas. And when you calibrate a policy response to something you have to understand if is it a one off shock, one winter, one war or is it a permanent shift and if it's a permanent shift you'd have to imagine the policy response is going to look a little bit different to the one we're getting. And I think in the beginning February March they thought it was going to be one winter, right? Maybe there's a peace agreement, Nord Stream 1, maybe even Nord Stream 2 at some point would come flowing and we'd still have that cheap Russian gas. What you see in Europe now is an entire recalibration. You had Greta Thunberg in an interview with German TV telling the German government you might as well keep nuclear still on if they're running because it's better than coal. Germany is spending billions to build LNG terminals because they now need to import more liquefied natural gas. It is a complete recalibration for Europe. Do you think that's the problem when teenagers start to shape policy? This is where we end up, seriously. The pandering on the left are big, big issues that can't be resolved overnight. They can't be resolved overnight. These issues cannot be resolved overnight. And winter 2023, winter 2024 is going to be incredibly challenging for Europe. The United States will beat, we are a net exporter of product. Different situation in the US. Completely different situation. Tricerate. And actually, when you look at gasoline prices, even though in Nevada, they're say $5 a gallon in California, Ben Emman's was just telling me they're $6. The Europeans will laugh at us. That is their norm. André Holtz and here in New York City, we're just in the next hour as well.

There is a lot of interest in this idea of personalized nutrition and especially how accessible it is to the public. You can go on Google and type personalized nutrition or diet and genes and you will find dozens of different companies that offer this nutrition precision tests. One of those companies is Routine. Routine claims that their personalized tests stemming from sciences like Nutri-Genomics make their supplements different. But even with the claims from routine as well as dozens of other personalized nutrition companies, the science still has a long way to go. All Street Preparers for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak whole, fishiness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to super-aggress our inflation? That just has a long way to go. Inflation is still stick, the US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite a ways away from the Fed. This is a Fed that will blame the protein thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. You will put a woman on Mars.

At the same time, the financing costs are going up so there cannot be the same fiscal response on the other side. really yes it's a trilema it doesn't seem like there's a happy ending for it and that's certainly what the signal is from the United Kingdom. Well these are the trade-offs we need to talk about could you have a permanent facility that looks at sitting at the long end of the gilt curve and still raise interest rates do something at the front end at the same time. They couldn't communicate that this is for financial stability that would be that problem is it because at this point they're making the excuse that this is entirely for financial stability no longer is if suddenly they're just sitting there and they're trying to cap yields but if they don't then it cannot be really arranged so quickly that pensions will be able to get their books in order ahead of whatever is going to happen and leaving yields to get unmoored at whatever pace they're going to get.

13891," pensions will be able to get their books in order ahead of whatever is going to happen and leaving yields to get unmoored at whatever pace they're going to get. I believe QT is still slated in for the end of this month. It's kind of crows isn't it? The calendar in the UK right now. October 14th, Guild Market Operation Ends, End of the Month, Halloween, we get the fiscal announcement alongside the forecast for whatever they're worth. And then we get QT, the set to start a few days before the Bank of England's next decision. It seems pretty impossible. I also just want to raise this issue of credibility because there were two emergency interventions within 24 hours from the Bank of England in this particular market in the Guild Market. And then there was, you've got three days. And then we're done. What message are they trying to say? What are the back workings of some of these discussions with some of these pension fund managers in order to say we're getting fed up guys, get it together, sell what you got to sell, even if it's in a discount take a loss. I'm happy to go after central bankers any time, but just on the Governor Bailey quote from yesterday, you've got three days. Did people not realise it finished in three days? But what was the news in that? Were they thinking he would back away at the IMF meetings down in DC that he wouldn't say it's going to end on October 14th? I was watching some of the coverage of this yesterday and there was some people responding as if they didn't realise that actually the operation ended in three days. I don't think it was an issue of ignorance. It sounds like it's an issue of a lot of companies hoping that there would be some sort of extension, hoping that there would be some sort of central bank put so they wouldn't have to sell at such a massive discount. What you're getting right now is funds that are freezing, you're getting massive withdrawals from property funds. There is a desire to wait this out. Hope that this is a temporary dislocation. How much is this? There is a lack of desire to have forced sales at a time of incredible turmoil. Cliff had John Friday. I think a lot of people believe we've got one now. Your 30-year-old is up around about 20 basis points of 498 very briefly. Breaking 5%. John Augustine has Andrew Slim and City of Portfolio Manager and Morgan Stanley Investment Management. Andrew, you think we can get a rally into year end? Give me the reasons why. Well, I think we'll have a rally in the year and I think the market right now has a very hard time being competitive with the two year. I think you've got to get the two year coming down before you can get a rally. I think that might happen in a year end. I'm not sure today and tomorrow see inflation, inflation, will be particularly good, but I think they'll start to improve. Q3 earnings, I think, there's so much consensus now. They're going to be bad. They probably won't be good, but the consensus is so bad. It does remind me of Q2. I think the market will start to anticipate that the Fed's positioning in 2023 is going to become increasingly untenable. Most everyone wants commodity inflation coming down, but it's going to be more difficult to ring out wage inflation. I think there's a lesson of an appetite for that and I think the market will anticipate. So I wouldn't be surprised you get your normal end of the year, midterm year, rally. The question is where do we go from? Until then, and as I said, I think with the two year at 4.3%, bonds just are a very attractive alternative stock at this point. You need to see that you'll come down first. Andrew, for a long time, people have been conditioned rewarded just to hug the benchmark. The market cap weighted S&P 500. That needs to change clearly this year. Andrew, does it need to change next year too? Well, yeah, I mean, this is a big opportunity for someone like myself who's trying to drive out, but through active management, the top 10 stocks and the S&P are outrageously expensive compared to the other 490. And when I think about, okay, are we in a recession, not a recession? I don't think the top 10 stocks reflect a recession, but there are a whole host of stocks of the other 490 that are down 40, 50, 60%. That's a recession. Number two is if in fact earnings do begin to miss, I much rather own stocks that are already down a lot that's PEs are very compressed, then huddle in a group of stocks that are still expensive. Because I think if the Fed were to soften their stance, you could see the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2117,2022-10-12 10:38:10
13892," that hodl in a group of stocks that are still expensive, because I think if the Fed were to soften their stance, you could see the reverse of what happened this year, which is some PE expansion in very low PE stocks, even if earnings don't turn out to be so good. What I don't want to own is stocks that still have high PEs, whose earnings have come through and that seems to be in the very large cap stocks, that are heavily weighted in the US and P. So I'm not particularly bullish on the S&P cap weighted as I look out the next 12 months. So in other words, no big tech, but perhaps some of the home builders and some of the similar types of industries. You note that you like Home Depot, you like Lenar, you like some of these names that are tied to some of the pain that we've been seeing in the housing market. How much of that Andrew is hinged on this belief that there will be some sort of trigger the sort of Ben, Ben, Latler comment of some deceleration in the pace of rate hikes, providing some relief, some optimism. It's possible what I can tell you is if you look at these stocks the last 45 days, they've outperformed on a relative basis, the stock market, even though rates have continued to push higher. And the reason why that's important is these stocks started to underperform the market before mortgage rates started to lift. So they seem to do a good job of predicting where we're going in the future. And it goes back to this concept of what worries me in this market, this junction I hear over and over is people are buying and huddled in defenses. And once you get to a bottom, the worst thing known is the defensive because they will lag and I'm not saying we're at a bottom, but you need to start to accumulate stocks that you think could, could have quite a move if the market were to recover. And I think some of these early cycle stocks are starting to show good relative performance and I find that intriguing. Andrew, right now people are not worried about necessarily finding a bottom in specific stocks and sure that they are on a sort of weekly basis. Right now they're wondering about financial dysfunction on a pretty massive level and you're starting to see signs of potential contagion from the UK market. Certainly yesterday we saw that in the US market with stocks taking a leg lower, yields in the US taking a leg higher. Do you think that there is going to be some sort of inflection points, some sort of reckoning between financial stability and prioritizing that above, perhaps tackling inflation at the speed that central banks have been trying to do so? Great question. I'm not, I'm just not sure we know the answer to that. Lisa, it's a very tough question to know. I know that some of the traditional things like high yield have not relative to investment grade have not screened fear relative on a relative basis, but I'm an equity manager. What I'm more confident of is that pushing inflation down below certain level by lowering wage inflation, putting on pushing unemployment up is going to become increasingly difficult for the Fed to stick to that policies, especially when you're having all these problems in other parts of the world. So the pressure is going to mount on the Fed. And I'm not saying I don't like the term pivot, but I think there could be some moderation and the question is, will the stock market anticipate that? Don't think it's now. It's too early. I just think it's coming next year. I'm more confident of that than the contagion issue that you particularly put. Look, all central banks are trying to reverse decade of QE and it's improving to be very, very difficult. Andrew Slemen, thank you, sir, of Morgan Stanley. It's proven to be incredibly difficult. This was the criticism that Al Arian had on this program yesterday that it didn't have to be this way that the Federal Reserve has had to slam on the brakes because it is so great.

13893," On how much tightening we've seen already, rates are up 300 basis points in six months. Mortgage rates in this country have more than doubled year to date. The dollar, their trade-weighted dollar, is up something like 10-11 percentage points this year. That's a lot of tightening in this market. I'm glad that you and Mohammed talked about the Leal Breedner's speech. I'm not sure I got enough attention. It was a little bit of a shift in tone relative to some of the other federal officials in terms of emphasizing these particular issues. The push pull, the balance of risks, including over tightening and not allowing the lag effects to really take place. And that I think may be a shift in tone that we're going to be looking for over the next couple of months, certainly if there's any relief whatsoever. But it should be an anticipated shift in tone. These guys wanted to pause. At some point, as what Charles Evans was talking about earlier this week as well, I just don't know if pausing because the economy is rolling over is as bullish as the equity market rules would make it out to be. I'm sympathetic to your view. I'm not going to push back on that one and I think that you could hear that in my comment Ben Leidler. There is an issue. Obviously, you start to see the earnings really prove the point. Well, not exactly a rosy scenario. You'll get to rupt 21 basis points in the UK, 498. Just short of 5%. We went through that level a little bit earlier this hour. Live from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Polish authorities say they believe a leak in a pipeline bringing Russian oil to Europe is probably an accident. Poland's top official in charge of strategic energy infrastructure says he has no reason to assume it was an act of sabotage. Pipeline operator Perne says it expects to know the potential causes in just a few hours. Perpian authorities are on high alert for any signs of sabotage on energy infrastructure since the destruction of the Nord Stream gas pipelines last month. NATO defense chiefs are gathering in Brussels today to discuss how to better protect critical infrastructure, ramp up weapons production and maintain support for Ukraine. Meanwhile, the U.S. is speeding up shipment of two advanced air defense systems to Ukraine and responds to pleas by President Vladimir Zelensky for partners to supply more weaponry in the fight against Russia. The U.K. economy shrank unexpectedly in August for the first second time in three months, raising the possibility that the country is now in a recession. The Office for National Statistics says the sharp 0.3 percent drop in industrial production was the main cause of the decline. Many analysts anticipate that drop means the economy will be lucky to avoid a downturn in the third quarter, marking the start of a cost of living recession.

13894," Material samples brought back from objects in space can shed light on billions of years of our solar system's history, including details about the origin of life here on Earth. A piece of an asteroid is a piece of the earliest beginnings of a solar system. But picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close. Probes need to land on surfaces with weak gravitational poles where the surface terrain is completely unknown, gather samples, and then make the long trip back. And while behemoths like NASA and SpaceX grab headlines, it's a relatively young space agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, better known as Jaxa, that is taking the giant leap necessary to bring the mysteries of space back down to Earth. It means they have a Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Containershiping is the key component of global trade. About 80% of all the world's goods are transported at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. Three percent may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Once reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? The real issue is we need to do more. We have not seen inflation move back down. And we need to see that because leaving inflation where it is continues, there's a higher chance that it does become embedded in the economy. The Redemester, the Cleveland Fed President, that lady is not returning anytime soon on hiking interest rated teams. Live from New York City this morning. Good morning. Here's the price action. Equity is bouncing back from five days of losses on the S&P. A half of 1% yield is just a little bit higher by a basis point or two on a 10 year in the US at 39637 in the UK yield to a whole lot higher on a 30 year up by 20 basis points to 498. You see this headline from early this morning, the Japanese 10 year lease, the bond hasn't traded for four days. But the first time since 1999, talking about a broken market in the UK, can we talk about just a broken mess over in Japan? It's not even a market. How many times have we said that? It's not a market, so we're seeing the relief valve is in the yen and you saw the yen actually weaken to levels that were beyond where we had seen when they actually did intervention. So at what points this being new intervention at what point does this mean that Japanese authorities have to more aggressively liquidate their FX reserves at a time when they're planning for a pretty long haul it seems. What a crazy time. Rick Reed has said it was a crazy time. Mohammed said he's never seen anything like this before either. Truly historic. Joining us from DC on what it's shaping up to be.

13895," You've got a special guest for us. Well, John, it's going to be very interesting. If you remember yesterday afternoon, and here's the headline buried in the news flow, the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey. This is at the IIF Annual Membership Meeting yesterday in conversation with Tim Adams, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Institute of International Finance. And we begin today's coverage in Washington with Mr. Adams, with his deep experience with the Bush Administration and with international economics, certainly Tim in time of crisis. So thank you so much for starting our day. Strong, we've got Axel Weber coming up as well, much more on Europe than that. What was it like yesterday when Governor Bailey set reset the global debate? Well, thanks, Tom, it's always a pleasure to be with you. Thank you for having me. You know, look, I think we're hearing from Governor Bailey and others who will have Corota and Chris Ingligar today. They're serious. They're serious about taking the punchball away. It's time to reverse the policies we've seen over the past seven to eight years. This time to move on to the new normal. And I think Andrew said he's ready to get on with it. Stanley Fisher, five years ago, six years ago, talked of ultra-accommodative. We clearly moved through a commentator. We're trying to search for neutrality. And even some of these bankers desire a restrictive state. Does that put out the zombie companies? Is the final result of all of this movement? That we eliminate the zombie companies? And indeed, I say the zombie banks of which you represent? Yeah, well, I don't represent zombie banks. Banks are in good shape. But yes, the zombie companies are going to go, and they should. This is creative destruction. This is the way cycles work. And for far too long, we've had cheap liquidity, an abundant amount of liquidity. And we fund a lot of firms, a lot of sectors that probably shouldn't be in business. We need to redeploy those resources, those assets, in more productive ways. You said on the political side of this debate serving the younger president Bush, would you suggest the politicians have power here or renewed power with British yields out at 5% with Yannet 146? What's the power of politicians this morning? Well, the politicians want it both ways. They want to get rid of inflation as quickly as possible, because they see it every day, gasoline prices, for example. But they want to do it in a painless way. They want to do it in a way that doesn't create disruption. It's very difficult to do, central bankers have probably the toughest job they've ever had right now. Okay, I'll go with that. But Secretary Geithner, 15 years ago, 17 years ago, would say the solution is to extend the timeline. Why are we in such a hurry to bury the economy into a global recession? What's the race here? I think there's a sense of catch up that they're waiting too long. Right on it. And so they want to make up. I think some of it is just bringing back the reputation of the institutions. There's a concern that maybe some, the Fed or other institutions have lost some of the reputation as being tough. I think Jay wants to prove a point. And I think you heard from Andrew yesterday he wants to prove a point too. Can they stop and pause? They can. I don't know that they will. It depends on what they might see. Obviously, there's a lot of turmoil around the world. War and the continent of Europe, gasoline prices, as we see from OPEC. I think they're pretty adamant about moving ahead. I must turn to banking, of course, the great mystery. And this goes back to Fortis of Belgium years ago, which is where in Europe there were transactions and combinations across borders. That's always a challenging thing. With the challenges at a selected Swiss bank, do you look for transactions and combinations within the members of the Institute of International Finance? We do. Risk assessments are an important part of what we do here. That's why we have a board of 50 institutions that encompass the world. So we constantly talk about risk. Our board meeting tomorrow will be a conversation about where do we see weaknesses in the system and how do our institutions communicate with each other? Okay. I'll go with that. But the reality is selected regions, book values of banking are to use a American phrase, flat on their back. What is the urgency right now to pick a region within European banking? Well, we know the book to value ratios and Europe are pretty soft. The Europe needs something different than just monetary policy. They need consolidation at 4,000 institutions across the country. Exactly. And so we need consolidation. And well, you need Brussels and capitals to act. We need a Consolidate Capital Market, which benefits US firms here.

We have the largest capital market in the U.S., which helps the JP Morgan's and Bank of America, which we'll hear from today and tomorrow here. But Europe needs banking consolidation and you need Capital Market Union. You are steeped in Washington and in the politics of a traditional Republican party, which some people would say has gone the way of a fossil. And that what does the Biden administration need to do to solidify American leadership other than to generate a strong dollar? Well, we need to deal with energy and I think they've tried it both ways. What is to talk about a climate transition, which we should. But in the near term, we've got to find ways to produce moral oil and get it hyped to the place it needs to be. We need to address the near term security and affordability concerns. Are you going to make headlines today like you did with Governor Bailey yesterday? Is there a reduction here with the garden? Come on. We are indeed. We are. It's a very big day. Tim Adams, thank you so much with the Institute of International Finance, John. And I'll tell you, if he can do back-to-back, John with Christine Lagarde, what he did with Andrew Bailey yesterday. John, our jobs are a threat. Hey, TK. Thank you. Great work down in Washington. To Tom's point, President of the Garden, Governor Bailey, what have they got in common? I was thinking back to those comments in early 2020. We're not here to close spreads. President Lagarde, did you get the same feel from Governor Bailey yesterday? You got three days? I saw you put that out on Twitter and I figured that you are basically highly skeptical that really some of these pensions were that basically they're not going to be able to bank of England's not going to be able to hold firm to something that is triggering financial stability. So significantly, and so they'll have to eat their words and then threaten to undermine their credibility. That said, this is a different scenario for one reason, and that is simply inflation. And as you get inflation, continuing to creep up, it becomes increasingly difficult in the rock and the hard place is very much in for with the UK, poised for its second monthly contraction in three months. And so, you know, at what point are they forced to accept higher inflation for longer? It's Tom asked the good question, what's the appropriate time horizon to get inflation back down towards Target. They're worried about the 70s and the prospect of a flip-flop that they back away too early and then have to go hard again. And it's got messy quickly. How many times I used that worth a small number one hour? Well, it is incredibly messy. Front loading, I think, is being called into question. Do you front load or do you go gradual? Thanks, Tom Zombies. I'm not the one to hear overseas. From New York City, this is Blimpag. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful to be big and move the needle in Amazon, is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly?

Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks gonna do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. In the ultimate output for a company is share price. In that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. That's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long-term, things tend to work out.

For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual. But you're always, always learning. The question is, does the Fed blink? I don't think it will. How do you explain to markets in the public that you still have resolve in fighting inflation? If you're slowing down rate heights? Instead inflation got out of control and now we need to really get it under control, which is going to be a process. The Fed have got a domestically focused mandate. Market functioning problem in the US, we haven't really seen it, especially when we compare it to what's happening in the UK. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City this morning, Good morning, Good morning for our audience worldwide. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio. Here in New York alongside Lisa Brownwood, some Jonathan Farrow, equally future positive this morning that wasn't the story yesterday. New lows for 2022 on the S&P 500 new highs for a two-year yield in yesterday session. And concerned about contagion, concerns about financial instability, concerns about this question of, is the market going through the windshield of Muhammad Aliens terms? At a time when the Fed and central banks around the world are slamming on the brakes at a speed that we have never seen before. And then kind of stepping back in simultaneously at the same time. To pick up on another Muhammad analogy about actually driving a car, he said a number of weeks ago it was like putting the accelerator down and putting the brake down simultaneously. What happens? The smoke coming out of the engine. The smoke coming out of the engine right now, 30-year yield of 18 basis points this morning. I just have to say I hate that kind of driving. And I've got to say I always feel sick. And so is this market. And that's the fear is that right now you cannot have your cake and eat it too. And that is the conclusion from a central bank in England that tried to both ameliorate financial stability concerns while still grappling with the highest inflation in decades. But to me the big takeaway is the signs of contagion, the signs that this is not isolated simply to the United Kingdom, that there are similar signs of this type of trading in other markets as well, including in the ECB where they're going to have to deal with the Italian, with the Spanish, with the Greek yields. Can you believe it's only Wednesday? No. I was doing a yesterday. I was going through the price action yesterday and I was like, it's Tuesday evening. What is going on?

13899," It is a challenging environment, let's say, for the Prime Minister right now. I suspect this is going to be a fairly feisty Prime Minister's questions. Equally challenging guy for the Government of the Bank of England as well. I want you to frame the importance of his comments yesterday. We always knew the line in the sand was October 14th. What was special about what he had to say yesterday in Washington? It was already iteration, but a lot of people are making claims that it was a communications error. I can see the reason for that in as much as he has once again put himself in a position where he gives himself very little flexibility. I think that's where the issue lies. There is also this FT report which is floating about this morning, talking about the fact behind closed doors, bank officials have been talking about the potential for the extension of the scheme. I don't know the veracity of that report. I don't know what meetings were held and what was said. But if that is the case, then that obviously is double speak and that is not tenable. But guy. Yeah, okay, Lisa. No, I guess I'm struggling with this one. Because let's say there were some back office discussions about the potential for an extension. Why wasn't there a more concerted effort on the part of fund managers to offload the potential leverage positions that were causing the problems in the first place? I think there have been, and I think there has been effort clearly to raise collateral ahead of the Friday deadline. The way the bank of England's structured this whole process is very different to QE. With QE, they were they were they were price agnostic here and they would buy as much as you as you wanted here. They're not here. They're basically trying to manage the process. This is about a rate of change, not the rate. They are they're trying to slow the rate of change and avoid the turmoil, but they acknowledge that ultimately rates have to go higher. So they're not trying to bring rates down. So that that has made this a less useful product for the markets than originally. I think was conceived when it was first announced. And as a result of which you got this kind of huge round trip, you go from five down to four and we're kind of back up to five again in terms of in terms of what the 30 year is in terms of the yield. And I think it's taken a few days for the markets to kind of get its arms around all of this, but this is not this is not carte blanche. This is not the bank of England buying everything you want to sell them. They'll buy it and they are being choosy on what they're buying, but they're not buying everything and there have been days when they haven't bought anything. And I think it's been a less useful product. And basically what Bailey's been sigling is get your house in order. You're running out of time, but every time that is reiterated, I think it just reinforces the idea that there is still a long way to go. Not much as maybe not as much as being as has been as unwound because the market was looking for more time ultimately. And that is now not going to be delivered. That's a very long way of putting all this. But I think it's huge amounts of confusion. John, I got to say I feel for guys. He tries to parse through this. It's difficult. This is because basically this is him trying to explain a policy that at its core is a paradox, both addressing financial stability, allowing some sort of easing, unwinding of positions that are untenable in the current regime, will also find inflation using very similar types of tools in terms of raising rates. It is mind spinning. I can see why they're very, very sensitive about the concept of fiscal dominance right now. I can see why they are almost immediately. The questions were asked at the bank of England. Will they accommodate what this government is going to do? And when they first came up with the guilt market operation, they were accused of just that pandering, accommodating what fiscal policy makers had decided to do. So I think it's really, really difficult for them to do now. And I think that's why we're seeing the kind of language the approach that we've seen from Governor Bailey. That's my guess. I can't get inside his head. The sense I get from him and the way he spoke yesterday just sounded like a man who was very, very sensitive to the idea that they might be contributing to so-called fiscal dominance. There is an argument that for decades, central banks helped offset a lack of action from fiscal policy makers, a lack of action from Washington, DC, for the parliament. And this is a question now of can the central banks pull back and stop giving the fiscal policy makers a pass and risk financial instability and risk, perhaps disrupting things to such an extent that imperils the base-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2125,2022-10-12 11:12:53
13900," and stop giving the fiscal policy makers a pass and risk financial instability and risk perhaps disrupting things to such an extent that imperils the basic functioning of a capitalist society. And this is going to become an increasing debate in the months. There's something else is going on here and I don't think it's talked about enough. The Bank of England has got a guild market operation of a certain size and they can't find the sellers. So no one wants to monetize the losses in the guild market and I wonder why there's not been talked about more. It seems to be big enough. They just can't seem to be able to buy enough. What? Have you got a why? Why that's not happening? That's basically what Guy was saying in a much more diplomatic way. That it wasn't unlimited, that this isn't a cap bond yield. So nobody's going to really necessarily sell into it if they're going to have to solidify losses that are punitive. The Guy Johnson over in London, one of the best. Good friend of mine.

The heart has been engaged. So we have to be shown more empathy, show that we care that their citizens and the community, their members of the family and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee, be an employee and be a person to the community and the family.

I do wonder where that leaves this little budget announcement when we get at the end of this month, this fiscal announcement. If they're not going to get spending reductions, are the tax cuts still going ahead? Well, yeah, they're actually suggesting that perhaps they'll mitigate some of the tax cuts or not actually make them as deep as expected. But you're right. At some point, the equation isn't working. You're seeing that in the pound. You're seeing that in the guilt market. You're seeing foreigners flee the market at what point does those trusts as administration have to take notice?

I mean, I don't want to feel like I've got sympathy, but at the same time, they're between a rock and a hard place. We've been saying it all morning. It's become cliche. But how do they manage financial stability with an unstable fiscal picture with few details? Are they making it harder for themselves? Yes, they're between a rock and a hard place, but you think they're making it hard for themselves. By interfering at all, but they just let the market collapse. I mean, what do they do?

13902," They should just let the market collapse. I mean, what do they do? It's hard to know. Not offering a permanent facility, a permanent guild market operation. Are we going to end up there anyway? Something that sits on the long end. Our tensions get out of this mess. They were hoping that it would not come to that because it is an incredibly messy message to say we're doing quantitative easing and we're going to raise rates and it is an incredibly messy consequence on the market. However, if that's the consequence, do they get a reduction in inflation or are yields going to be permanently higher for longer? It's messy the word of this morning. Maybe the word of this year. Anastasia Ramarosa joined us now to make sense of the mess. The chief investment strategist at I capital. Anastasia, we all filled this question and I'll ask this question of you. What does it mean for me sitting here in the United States allocated to US capital markets with this mess playing out in the UK? Well, I think it's a big warning sign and it's a red flag and we should not just assume just because we're not in the United States, we're immune from it. I mean, if you think about what's happened over the last 14 years, you had virtually zero interest rates around the world and that means that certain leverage accumulated certain places and it's not in the corporate side per se. It's not in the consumer side per se, but it leverage has accumulated on the government balance sheets. If you think about the United States and the fact that we were running a $2.7 trillion budget deficit last year and the Fed was responsible for essentially financing a third of that, well, now, luckily we're reducing our budget deficits and we're in track for a trillion dollars or so in budget deficit. But there's no Fed, there's foreign buyers, they're increasingly stepping back, there's banks are not as involved. So I think this is a real risk that we should think about, think through in the US as well. What happens when we were financing our debt at 1.4% give or take? And now what happens when some of that debt service has to reset and be done at 4%. So I'm not saying that we follow suit in what happens in the UK, but clearly fiscal policy makers have to be extra careful about how they manage budget deficits when raising rising. And I was looking at a Bloomberg economic study yesterday to exactly that point as basically pointing it, how much higher as a proportion of GDP interest expenses will be for developed worlds around the globe, simply because of this regime and because there isn't the same kind of fiscal constraint embedded in a lot of these communities, at what point have stock investors in the US appreciated this lack of a fiscal impulse? I don't think we're quite there yet Lisa. I mean, what we've grappled with is the fact that, these resetting higher of interest rates is going to depress multiples and that's what the bulk of this year has been about. But I think now if anybody's paying attention to it or anybody paying attention cannot deny that we now have a set of circumstances that clearly point to a recession, whether it's a mile one or a severe one or something like that. But you look at interest rates across the world. You look at yield curves across the world. You look at demand expectations and things like new orders and new business that are severely coming down, you really can deny that this is a recipe for a recession. And the reason why the market participants I say are not quite prepared for it is because the multiple today it's 16 times give or take and that's not recessionary. We likely need to see that go down to 13 or 14 times in order to say yes, we truly priced in an economic slowdown that is a recession. Oh, and by the way, we also have to look at the earnings side of the equation and earnings estimates need to come down by 13% in a kind of typical recession. Again, we are maybe halfway to cutting those earnings estimates where we're not quite there yet. So that's why for us to truly grapple with this as market participants, as equity investors, we likely need to see the S&P go down to 3200, unfortunately, to truly price in this current set of circumstances. On the flip side, people have been trying to go into longer dated bonds, into longer dated treasuries as the hedge, because ultimately they will come down and it has been a pain trade. As those yields continue to climb higher, where do you stand on this at a time when yes, we're getting the highest yield going back to the financial crisis. However, there is an inflation experience that we have not seen for decades. Yes, I think it's a very complicated trade and probably too risky of a trade to have any sort of high conviction on right now. I think you look at the short end of the curve, you can absolutely allocate there. You don't have that much duration experience.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2128,2022-10-12 11:26:03
13903," probably too risky of a trade to have any sort of high conviction on right now. I think you look at the short end of the curve, you can absolutely allocate there. You don't have that much duration exposure. But if you look at the long end of the curve, there's two challenges at least. First of all, if you look at the liquidity in the Treasury market, it is at the worst level since March of 2020. So if anybody's trying to move any size that's going to have an outsized impact on the Treasury market and yields cans by a higher. And yes, I would love to make the argument that if we are headed for a recession, then yield should move lower in the long end of the curve. But you also have to consider the demand supply equation of Treasury. And as I mentioned, we now don't have the Fed that's a buyer. We don't have the banks that are in the market all that much to the extent that they were before. And we also have foreign exchange reserves that are being run down across the world. So you don't have that demand from foreign investors. Oh, and also, in currency adjust to terms, US Treasury's are not as attractive as the ones were. So I worry that some of these structural issues about liquidity and demand might counteract any sort of yields moving lower because of us pricing in a recession. So that's why I say it's a risky trade and it's a complicated trade. And there's probably better ways to hedge a recession at this point than that. And Estesia, thank you. As always, and Estesia Amaro, so they're a vi capital. We're trying to reintroduce price discovery without the participation distortion contributed by central banks. And we're finding it very, very difficult to get to that new destination. I haven't often talked about that yesterday. Has done in the past as well. Finally, that new equilibrium is going to be a difficult journey, especially when it's not just central banks. It's also international investors because on a currency hedge basis, as Anastasia was saying, it doesn't make sense. Japan is a huge sort of elephant in the room here with respect to purchasing treasuries and not being able to right now. Still trying to work out what life at the Bank of Japan looks like post-corrota, whether the yield curve controls stays or whether it goes with it. I think they wanted the same thing. I think that they're curious if this is going to be out. They're trying to work it out. I think so. I think they'd love your input. In real time. It's like they're consulting. I think so. I think that's what I want to need that today. Yeah, messy. That would be a mess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2129,2022-10-12 11:29:47
13904," The deal was the brainchild of Apollo CEO Mark Rowan. In January, Apollo closed its $11 billion all-stock merger with a theme holding. It had already owned 35% of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects that to double to about $1 trillion by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies typically go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. A theme is a steady provider of fee income. It is grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers. The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. It gave up its dual-class share structure and adopted a one-share one-vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. It's going to be short for Bloomberg markets to close weekdays on Bloomberg. New intraday low on the S&P 500 for 2022. In yesterday's session, 35.68. Here's the price action this morning on equity futures. Trying to bounce back from five days of losses on the S&P by 3.1% on the NASDAQ 100. By almost one full percentage point. Unbelievable to think that on the S&P 500 lease. We've taken out almost all of the post-vaccine gains on November 2020. Almost all of them. When you put in money and then you take it out, you're going to have to pay for it. Where are we now? And really how low can it go? And that was what Anastasia was talking about. How much have we already priced in with respect to some sort of downturn to remedy the inflation? Big turn around in the bond market too. There's contributed to a lot of this. So two years was about 20 something basis points a year ago. It's now 4.30. And yesterday came very close to closing at about 4.35 at the highs of the year. On a 10-year at the moment, 3.95.34. And it's changed on the session your 10-year. Still need a decade highs of around about 4%. Elsewhere though, the guilt market getting all the attention for all the wrong reasons. Your 30-year was hired by something like 20 basis points at one point. Now at by 15.4.95. The drama's not over. It might not even be over on Friday when the guilt market operation ends. Maybe that gets extended. But right now this governor of this bank of England leased her is pushing back. And so is the prime minister as well. She's saying you've got three days. So you've got a couple of days from Thursday into Friday. And the prime minister is saying in prime minister's questions in Westminster in House of Parliament. That she's not planning UK public spending reductions. They're not back in a way either. Go into this fiscal announcement at the end of this month. I keep going back to it. What point do central bankers have no other choice than not to impose discipline, necessarily, on policy makers. But by pulling back and saying, this is not our gig. This is on you and we cannot support it because we have a mandate to fight inflation. And that's going to be our priority. Will they have the political to do that? Steve Major of HSBC, did you read the piece in the FT this morning? I did not. Just a list of recommendations on what he thinks the bank in England should do. Also has a suggestion for the DMO, the debt management office in the UK. So something we talked about in this program a million times. It's the average maturity in the UK is something like 13 to 14 years in the guilt market. He thinks you should bring that in. If you're going to wish you debt off the back of this fiscal plan, do it at the front end. Don't lock in what's happening at the long end, maybe shorten the maturity up a little bit. Then the bank can be able to come out and have some kind of permanent operation at the long end. And if you're going to do active QT, you can do that too. But maybe don't touch the long end, do something towards the front end and then raise rates at the same time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2130,2022-10-12 11:34:33
13905," have some kind of permanent operation at the long end. And if you're going to do active QT, you can do that too, but maybe don't touch the long end, do something towards the front end, and then raise rates at the same time and reconsider how fire actually going to take those interest rate increases. Incredibly smart, and I can understand this taking shape, at least from a market perspective. I cannot understand this taking shape from a political perspective, because it goes very directly to them, really offsetting a plan by a prime minister. There's just no optimal policy response. No. I'm just trembling trying to think about what is the least worst option right now, and that doesn't just apply to the U-Cath and applies to a lot of places. And that has to do with what's going to happen with CPI in terms of inflation later this week on Thursday tomorrow. And then on Friday, we start to get some of the earnings, particularly with the big banks, and right now what you're seeing from specific companies, just a real divergence in terms of which companies can pass along the prices. They see the higher prices in which can't. And I point to Intel overnight, they came out and they said they're going to be cutting thousands of jobs, and essentially their first massive job cut program going back to 2016, where there's been a well-publicized feeling of just how much pain a lot of these semiconductor companies have been feeling. Intel shares have been down nearly 50% year to date, more than 50% year to date. They are up slightly in pre-market trading. Our chip makers really the tea leaf for the rest of the economy. And I keep wondering this when we talk about Apple, when you talk about Google, you talk about the demand for some of these products. And John, I think that that's increasingly going to be a conversation. There's a geopolitical overlay in all of this as well. But I think we've started to see this across a range of industries, from Nike with too much inventory to FedEx, which is seeing a really sharp, slow off into an exseason. I think that's the number one reason, a primary reason why a lot of people have pulled back on expectations for this earnings season. We had Ben Ladler with a bullish view from Etoro about an hour ago, talking about maybe you skip over a low bar in 3Q. Maybe you do. But Bank of America are making the point. Guidance for next year, for the next quarter, for the next 12 months. How optimistic can you be when global growth is set to decelerate even more? Well, and I will just point to this, because on the flip side, just a sort of give a note of optimism from people who say that I'm about to, you know, fall off a cliff here. You did see Pepsi actually upgrade their forecast for their earnings. And you saw this, despite the fact that they raised prices for consumers, they're able to pass long prices on chips on soda. Is this a sign of weakness? Because people are downgrading what they are buying in terms of food, or is this a sign of strength? And how do you sort of, such these aspects out with some sort of longer term projection? So this is the number one for margins. When you look at inflation coming down, if it does come down over the next 12 months, what really matters to margins is what pocket of the inflation story is sticky and what fades. Do these companies lose pricing power at the same time that the wage cost story remains sticky for the rest of this year? That just screams smaller margins. It was interesting here from Vice Chair Brainard in that speech she talked about the potential for margin recompression. As the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve basically telling you, there's huge scope for profits to come down in corporate America. And this is sort of the opposite of what we saw for so many years, where markets did better than the economy and they're trying to shift that and have the economy do better than markets at a time when you already seeing stickier wage growth. This is what Larry Summers was saying just yesterday. Joining us now is Rebelli Faroukie, the chief US economist at high frequency economics. Rebelli, we look at the labor market data and it tells us that things are okay. Do you think that overstate will essentially happen in this economy? Great to be with you. Thanks for having me. I do think that the labor market data is telling us that the US economy is certainly not in recession and certainly not in contractionary dynamics. But this is not a leading indicator. Things can change very quickly. We saw we've seen that that's been the typical pattern. So we're not taking, we are taking some comfort in the fact that the labor market is hanging in. But with the Fed, with policy really aiming at softening the labor market, I think that's going to be the next thing that we see over coming months, a slowdown. What we're really trying to figure out right now is things are still positive, manufacturing still going, services are still growing. At what point do you go from the positive impulse to a negative impulse? And that has been very difficult for us to assess. Rebelli, just to stay on wages for a moment. Larry Summers in a conversation with City Group yesterday. He said that he'd be watching wage inflation very carefully, that he thinks it's a lot stickier than people currently appreciate. And he said, you cannot become a low inflation country with a high wage inflation. And wage inflation is looking pretty high.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2131,2022-10-12 11:39:10
13906," carefully that he thinks it's a lot stickier than people currently appreciate. And he said, you cannot become a low inflation country with a high wage inflation. And wage inflation is looking pretty high in the United States. Do you think that there is an underappreciated risk of a wage spiral? You know, we don't see a wage spiral right now. We do think that the risks are certainly stacked, you know, somewhat to in that direction, just because we're not seeing the supply come back. But I do think that, you know, policy right now is directed at bringing that demand down to match supply. Whether the Fed is going to be able to do that successfully or not, it remains to be seen. But we've seen very aggressive move so far. And that bill, it will weigh on demand, pretty substantially demand for labor. So I do think that, you know, we don't really see that dynamic playing out right now, but the risk is certainly there. The other thing that he said that he thought that neighbor or the neutral jobless rate required to get inflation under control post pandemic will be a lot higher. That it'll be about 5 percent rather than the 4 percent that people have previously been looking at. Do you agree with that? I certainly think that the Fed officials have also weighed in on this. I certainly think that there is, you know, Lero is probably higher, you know, at least over this period of time, just because of where, you know, what the dynamics are in the labor market. But I do think that in the longer term trajectory, I don't think that they're much different from the 4, 4 and a half percent that, you know, Fed officials have marked. But yes, it certainly does create a challenge in the very short term because with an unemployment rate that's at a 50 year low of 3 and a half percent, if Nero is higher, then definitely there needs to be an adjustment. Rebecca, if you look out what's playing out in the UK right now, is there a lesson in there somewhere for this Fed? Absolutely. I mean, the lesson is that the risks are definitely elevated over financial event. But, you know, if you hear from Fed officials, they're saying that, you know, markets are functioning. They have an eye on what's happening abroad. They have an eye on what's happening in global markets. But yeah, I mean, we do think that there's a risk of a financial event that's going to feed into policy decisions. But, you know, for now, the US markets, the global markets, these are isolated events. There is a risk of a spillover. But, you know, we are keeping an eye on it. We don't think that, you know, risk of contingent of global financial market meltdown, you know, is really unfolding right now. Rebecca, thank you. Rebecca, thank you there for your frequency economics. Just to set the scene for you, happening at the same time right now, the Prime Minister addressing the House of Parliament, speaking in London in Prime Minister's questions at the same time we're hearing from the Chief Economist of the Bank of England, Hugh Pill. The Bank of England's Hugh Pill saying a significant monetary policy response is required, Lisa, November 3rd is their meeting. A significant monetary policy response is required. Slow and demand growth will call wage growth in the UK. He characterises tight labour markets pushing up wage growth as a mix blessing for the United Kingdom. I wonder how the government would see it. And isn't that the problem? I think that line almost captures everything that's wrong right now with the way the government would like things to be. And the way the Bank of England would like to see things evolve. The government, pretty much globally, governments want to see low unemployment rates, want to see people fully employed, want to see an economy that's strong, but want to get inflation down. And that is an incoherent reality, at least according to a lot of policy makers. When I found interesting, when I saw that headline that Hugh Pill said significant monetary policy responses required, my first question was to what are we going to talk about inflation? Are we talking about the disruption and financial stability on 30-year gilts? And that's also part of the problem because they're dealing with both potential policy responses at the same time. Again, these sort of incoherent battles that they've got to be fighting. Credibility is a word. Market volatility underlines the need for credibility. Credibility on what? On getting inflation back towards target? Being credible enough to make sure that they can maintain financial stability? Credibility on what? It's a great question. Our credibility that they're going to have the same message next week. I mean, that's the other issue is that they're changing in real time according to the data. So what are they targeting? And if they start to target financial stability too much at the expense of inflation, then to your point, is it an issue of backing the market and backing market activity above anything having to do with inflation? And then what does that do in terms of leaving yields higher for longer? I just get the impression from them. They don't want to give the impression that they're doing anything kind of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2132,2022-10-12 11:43:24
13907," If anything, having to do with inflation, and then what does that do in terms of leaving yields higher for longer? I just get the impression from them, they don't want to give the impression that they're doing anything other than focusing on getting inflation back towards target. That is the mandate of the MPC and the financial stability concerns are something they can address separately, but ultimately there is this line in the sand just to establish that there are no blurring of the lines here, even though we can all see how the lines blur. At one point, are they going to have to come out and say, look, these are incongruous and we're going to have to just fight inflation. Well, this guilt market operation might end on Friday, but maybe you get another one for Monday. See what happens. Messi. Then you never backtracked it, it's just different. Different. I like that.

The UK economy shrank unexpectedly in August for the second time in three months, raising the possibility that the country is now in a recession. The Office for National Statistics says the sharp 0.3% drop in industrial production was a main cause for that decline. Global Household wealth is on track for its first significant contraction since the great financial crisis of 2008. That's according to report by Allianz. Now global wealth report published today finds 2022 is likely to result in a nominal drop of more than 2%. Allianz researchers called this year a quote, turning point for global wealth amid scant signs that a meaningful reversal will follow. An older and cheaper class of diabetes drugs appeared to lower the risk of developing dementia. That's in a new study.

All Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hole, fish nest, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still sticky. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the fact? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the ball. This is a fad that will play the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. We will never break. Material samples brought back from objects in space can shed light on billions of years of our solar system's history, including details about the origin of life here on Earth. A piece of an asteroid is a piece of the earliest beginnings of a solar system. But picking up rocks from the surface of an asteroid or planetary satellite isn't as easy as it sounds. It requires voyages of millions of miles to bodies that have never been seen up close. Probes need to land on surfaces with weak gravitational poles where the surface terrain is completely unknown, gather samples, and then make a long trip back. And while the hemaths like NASA and SpaceX grab headlines, it's a relatively young space agency. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, better known as Jaxa, that is taking the giant leap necessary to bring the mysteries of space back down to Earth. I think there's a sense of catch up that they waited too long. And so they want to make up. I think some of it is just bringing back the reputation of the institutions. There's a concern that maybe some of the fed or other institutions have lost some of the reputation as being tough. I think Jay wants to prove a point. I think you heard from Andrew yesterday he wants to prove a point too. They all want to prove a point. Great conversation with Tim Adams there, the president and CEO of the Institute of International Finance. No, my favorite guest is someone who used to be a central banker, but isn't any more because they can now tell you what they think. And all of them come out really harshly and say, you're all making a terrible mistake, why are they going more aggressively? They're just so much more open about their feelings about the situation. Tom Kean, I think you've got the perfect guest to do just that. Well, I'm my interview of this, meetings of the International Monetary Fund and is here at the Institute of International Finance. Axel Weber is the force of the IIF, the chairman, but I must say far more importantly, the former president of the Bundesbank is service to UBS, as noted as well. We begin a one hour conversation. We're going to have to cram one hour Axel into the moment and you taught a course at Bouschal, Chicago, Central Bank theories and fact. What is the fact right now for J. Powell? I think the fact is that central banks are in a really bad situation. They have started late in raising rates. You could see already some trend breaking the price level in late 2000. They focused on the inflation rate, very early also exome elements that have been going up strongly and now the central banks are doing big steps to catch up with reality and there is some risk in that. So, I now look at monetary policy as an independent risk factor and I think monetary policy has a way to go. I don't believe that the current inflation rates will come down as easily as is predicted still by most of the central bank models. The tough work is ahead. I got so many ways to go here. I'm just exquisite at the time. Do we need to abandon a 2% level? Something Bundesbank is comfortable with something. I'm going to say traditional economics is comfortable with but it's part of the solution",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2134,2022-10-12 11:51:50
13909," Do we need to abandon a 2% level, something Bundesbank is comfortable with something, I'm going to say traditional economics is comfortable with, but it's part of the solution to move away from a 2% level inflation towards a 3% level as appropriate. I think that will completely blow the credibility of all central banks if they were to do that. They will be dead on arrival, because if you, what you need to do is to reestablish the credibility of the 2% target at a rate running just below 10%, that's a very difficult task. So central banks would, in my view, be completely misguided if they were to question the target. Now the point is, let's get back to target and that will take them, you know, at least two years. What we're going to do now, folks, is diving into some theory and we can do this with Professor Weber. I'm going to work off of a wonderful piece by Ambrose Evans, Richard in the telegraph. You can look at a theoretical construct like the Phillips curve, London School of Economics of 50s, or the beverage curve, which Kruvman talks about from even farther back as well. Central banking is hinging on a linkage between inflation and employment. Should they do that, or do they need to squeeze right down to a more Germanic focus on inflation? Well, I think they're long term. What really matters is the amount of debt in the economy and how it's accommodated by central banks. So I'm still a firm believer that in the long run, the balance sheet of the Fed and monetary policy matter and in the long run inflation is largely driven by factors like how accommodative are central banks for government debt? Of course, in conducting monetary policies through the business side, they need to look at the link between output, grows, employment, and inflation. It's a natural because their setting is within the economic economy. But long run, I think they haven't looked at the impact of this ultra-easy monetary policy on inflation that was about to come. How naive are we about QT? Original, unfounded rubenium, among others, may jokes about it. QEQT, how original is it in that we don't know really what's going to happen? No, I think the central banks have amassed a massive balance sheet, all central banks in the world. And if you look at the last 10 years, the fiscal expansion of roughly to the tune of 25% of GDP globally has been accommodated by an expansion of central banks balance sheet roughly of the same amount. So this additional government debt didn't have to be held in the market. It ended up in another government balance sheet by the central bank. And we haven't seen the interest impact and the long term inflation impact of that liquidity having to come from the market as opposed to come from another source of government funding. And I think long run central banks need to bring that balance sheet down. That will put pressure on debt and governments to consolidate. And I think long run, we cannot continue to run deficits that are, you know, mid-single digits and debt that is around 100%. Your history is you are death on short-term, medium-term, long-term analysis. It is a responsibility, a character out of Bundesbank that speaks for itself. Is the short-term path here to just extend things out, to ease up on the raising of interest rates at an appropriate point in use time to heal the wounds of the pandemic and this debt expansion? Well, I think you need to start doing the U-turn. You know, this is a change in times. Are we near the U-turn? I think central banks have started to raise rates late, but in my view, they started. And now what is important is what J-PAL says that the Jackson-Alts Beach, you've got to keep at it till the job's done and the job is not done. And so central banks have to raise interest rates and at the same time, they have to reduce their balance sheet. How constrained is ECB? How many degrees of freedom is Madam LeGuard lost here? With a war, plus a overlay, we've been talking about. Quite a few. The ECBs in a worse position than the Fed. Their economy is likely to take a much bigger hit. Their monetary policy has weakened the euro and that has increased price pressures for European citizens. We're much closer to the war and we're much more dependent on China in our exports and China is not doing well at the moment.

A major government policy reset is becoming even more urgent. That's his line on the UK. Here's a line from a minister of the Treasury in the UK. Mimements ago, no plans to reverse tax measures announced in September. And this is where the rubber meets the road for the Bank of England. And to Alex Weber's point there, do they say we are not going to facilitate this spending? We are not going to come up with a circuit breaker. This is on you. And we're going to fight inflation that is our mandate. If they get that, yes, you get financial markets dysfunction. But that is exactly what Alex Weber was saying in order to bring down debt, in order to inflict some discipline after a decade of central banks giving them a pass. You saw what Tim Adams said. They want to be tough. I think Jay wants to prove a point. I think you heard from Andrew yesterday. He wants to prove a point. You're who? It's on a first-time basis with the gelat with Jay and Jan.

We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting. And I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in the job, then you should quit. And frankly, when people leave 23 me, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me.

Re-adjusting for a moment in which financial instability is going to trickle out and central banks are somewhat tied in terms of how they respond to it. And that, to me, was really a takeaway from a day when we saw the United Kingdom grapple with this question of how long that program was going to be and whether the market pushback would cause them to cave. We've talked a ton about policy being in conflict, particularly between fiscal policy authorities and monetary policy officials at the same time within the central bank over the last couple of weeks. We've got a new conflict, the conflict between preserving financial stability and addressing inflation. And the bank of England right now is trying to address that and they're finally very, very difficult to do. At the heart of that conflict is a question about what the policy response is in the fiscal world. How much they can really coordinate or diverge from what you're seeing from politicians that want to see everything go right. They want to see the economy do well. They want to see people remain employed. They want to see wages rise in tandem with inflation but then stop. They want something that cannot be achieved without some pain and how much discipline do central bankers have to keep going at a time when they have the extra financial stability concern. It's a trade off somewhere. It is the policy trillema of 2022 right now yields are up higher in the U count of 30 year by around about 15 or 16 basis points back to 4.93. Breached 5% very briefly a little bit earlier this morning elsewhere futures are positive up 24 on the S&P up 7.10s of 1%. yields just a little bit higher by basis point at 3.95 96 and we still got this week Lisa CPI tomorrow and bank earnings Friday. It's going to be a wild week and just today we do get PPI at the producer price index coming out for the month of September in about 30 minutes time. There is a question of how much deceleration there will be particularly as oil prices continue to come down with OPEC just coming out now and saying they're expecting oil demand to come down.

13912," It's one of the key questions as you see central banks pulling back and Japanese investors, UK investors, where is the marginal buyer? Can we do price discovery after a decade or if did not exist? And at 2pm we get Fed meeting minutes coming out. Can we parse through some of the guidance or is it the same message? Inflation is number one. You cannot have a study labor market. You cannot have a study economy without some sort of price stability. Is that going to be the full message? Will there be some sort of signs for people to hold on to and plea that perhaps this could mean some sort of deceleration rate hikes? And then we get the Fed speak to help confuse the issue. Neil Cushkari, Michael Barr and Michelle Bowman, you know, who matters when we hear all of these federal officials speak? And will they come out with a willingness to push back against fiscal policy makers? I think this will be increasingly a question, John. At a time when you heard Axel Weber there talking about the need to cut debt in order to really make this a more sustainable, less central bank backed market. Tim Adams of the IIF with Tom Keane this morning, they want to be tough. I think Jay wants to prove a point. I think Andrew wants to prove a point. He's talking about Baleon, of course, panel as well. Just prove a point to markets or also prove a point to policymakers in terms of what is and what is not financially feasible when it comes to financing. Tom Keane down in Washington, DC for STK. Great interviews through this morning, buddy. Let's just talk about that line from Tim Adams to you about an hour ago. They want to be tough. They've got a point to prove. The toughness for Tim Adams meeting with Mr. Corota now here at the IIF or for the giant Axel Weber, John is simple. They're focused on tomorrow's CPI number. I think we haven't made enough of the importance of that data point tomorrow to the international community. We're going to drive forward that conversation with someone who knows 11% inflation. And John, you know that's another lens we'll speak with plus cannot of the Dutch central bank. I think you and I are coming up against the same conversations. A group of individuals that performed tremendously well over the last 10 years post GFC conditioned by their success rewarded for it who just wait for that moment to say when can I buy again rates are going to turn. Text going to rip. I want to get back in lost decade to Lee aren't unique. Do you think we face the potential for one now in certain pockets of this market? Yes, I think we have to accept that potential. I mean, you're right that there is even it seems strange to say when stocks have hit their lows with down 20% this year 30% in some areas. There is in the market still this default to optimism. So any bit of news, oh Fed's going to pivot that means we can start buying and it does come from the condition of the last you know 2008 through to 2020 where by on tips worked the central banks always had your back because whenever market sold off we saw loosening the policy restart QE and therefore it was a great buying opportunity. Any big drop was a great buying opportunity. This is different in that period there. Central we are now that that game is up. So this idea of default to optimism is really misguided but we keep seeing it. We keep looking for this pivot. Let's fight the inflation first and then worry about that. But yeah, you're right. Look, that's 12 years was all about QE the cent G three central bank balance sheets went from $4 trillion up to $27 trillion. That's what underpin that market. That doesn't mean we're going to see that over the next 10 years. John put it to perspective just moments ago Lee when he was talking about how the S&P has given up almost all the post covid gains. How far are we retracing? Do we go back to levels seen before some of the monetary stimulus but before the regime that you're talking about or is this sort of finding a floor to then create something new that we're closer to than perhaps further away. It's a really good question. I don't think we're going to go back to 666 on the S&P which we hit in March 2009 even I'm not that bearish but look, could we see another 10 15% from here? Yeah, quite honestly because when you look at long term valuations, we're still above the long term average and this is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2138,2022-10-12 12:09:17
13913," Look, can we see another 10, 15% from here? Yeah, quite honestly, because when you look at long-term valuations, we're still above the long-term average. And this is the most challenging fundamental backdrop we've had in 40 years. Well, guess what? 40 years ago, equity valuations were way below that long-term average. So it's very easy to see these losses continue. And I think we still haven't really factored in the new regime we're in. There is still this hope. You look at interest rates. You look at inflation swaps. There's still this hope. Inferation comes down quickly. The Fed starts cutting towards the end of next year. And that's going to want to pin the next rally. And it's sort of, look, we're not going to get that monetary stimulus we've been used to. I think we have to look ahead at least a few years and accent into your life forever then. This is a different era. Now it's about shrinking balance sheets. It's about reducing debt rather than the buildup you've seen over the last 12, 14 years. At least some of what you said echoed, what Jamie Dimon said to Juliana over at CNBC earlier this week, the potential for another leg lower in the equity market. He also talked about the pain that you get from the next 100 basis points, the tightening that you didn't get in the previous 100 basis points. Why is the next 100 basis points that much more painful? Well, you're going into restrictive territory. I mean, you can argue, we can argue when neutral is. And personally, I think neutral is a real rate, rather than a nominal rate. So I'm not even sure with inflation where we are. We can say we're neutral. But the theory is that neutral is around 2.5%, we're now just around that. So now we're going into restrictive territory. I'm not to sure the next 100 matters more than the previous 100. They all add up together. And it's a cumulative process. But certainly, for me, the Fed's not done. I mean, look at the data. Look at payrolls. We've got CPI tomorrow. Even if we get a consensus core, it's 0.4%. That's 5% year on year if you annualize that up. So that's nowhere near where the Fed wants it to be. So against that backdrop, how can the Fed... How can you talk about a Fed pivot when we're adding 60,000, 70,000 payrolls, the unemployment rate drops. And we're running core inflation, annualized this month, potentially at 5%. Lee, you won't find the strategist... You won't find the strategist that wants their clients in cash. So Lee, can you tell me... Is that the message you are conveying? Just be patient, just wait. Wait for the storm to pass. Absolutely 100%. You see what you forget? I'm an FX strategist primarily. So I'm quite happy with cash. Um... So this... That's the place to be without a doubt. Stop trying to pick this bottom. Stop trying to look for that pivot. You've got to ride this out, I think, for at least the next six months. Maybe towards the end of Q1, start of Q2. If we start to see payrolls falling, if we see consistent point 2s or below on the core CPI, then we can start having the conversation. We are not there yet. There's always a vested interest somewhere. I leave thank you. I'm going to catch up, sir. Lee Ferrets, the estate street global markets. I'm an FX strategist, staying in cash. Yeah, exactly. I like that you basically were saying, you know, do you think that their perhaps is a conflict with an institutional equity investor saying, you know, just staying in cash? You thought it wouldn't understand. I think even as a portfolio manager, that there's some people paying fees to you. And it's hard to make the argument that you should just be in cash, which pushes them to be tempted to do something that they otherwise, I guess, wouldn't want to do. How many people come on the show and talk about how they need to stay invested? They're paid to stay invested. They need to make some bets and make relative wages. And he's basically saying, well, I trade FX. I'm still trading, but yeah, staying in cash. I've been trying to listen much more to the bearish voices out there that are thinking about this moment a little bit more analytically than perhaps the permaballs of the last 10 years or so. Hugh Hendry in his podcast, I thought was absolutely brilliant. He had a retail investor on it. The retail investor said a line that we hear all the time, which is over the long term, I'm long stocks, because long stocks reward you over the long term. And Hugh turned around and he said something that I hadn't heard before, because usually we just let that line go. And he said, okay, you're basing that on 120 years of US market history, it just happened to be the time where the US rose to be the hegemonic power and all these great tech companies came around as well. Is that a big enough sample of data to make the assessment of the next 10 years is going to be great just because the last 100 were? It points to a little.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2139,2022-10-12 12:13:50
13914," Is that a big enough sample of data to make the assessment of the next 10 years is going to be great just because the last hundred were? It points to a lack of visibility at a time of sea change when it comes to monetary and fiscal policy and perhaps the globalization or re-globalization of a world very much in flux. I just see a lot of balls struggling to adjust to a new ration, sort of scratching their heads and having some empty conversations with them. I look depressed, don't I, and I know. I feel like I'm listening more to the bears. And I feel really sad. But you know, there is a fair question just trying to gauge what's happening. How do you get new parameters for a world where central banks are much more constrained? The Dutch central bank governor coming right up with Tom Keen from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Luis Mateo. President Biden is voicing his fury with Saudi Arabia over OPEC plus oil production costs, accusing the Kingdom of allying itself with Russia, and vowing to engage with US lawmakers clamoring to punish Riyadh. Now, the president added that he believes it's time for the US to rethink its relationship with Saudi Arabia. But administration officials say a legislative plan to retaliate is unlikely to materialize until November's midterm elections. Global household wealth is on track for its first significant contraction since the great financial crisis of 2008. And that's according to a board by Aliens. A global wealth report published today finds 2022 is likely to result in a nominal drop of more than 2%. Aliens researchers called this year a quote, turning point for global wealth. A mid-scan signs that a meaningful reversal will follow. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo, this is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record highs since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe, and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield, and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2140,2022-10-12 12:17:46
13915," Revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are, global agriculture perhaps even more so. Unlike metals for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences.

I think Chey Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bullfrog. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. When we were hit by the pandemic, Europe reacted in a very decisive manner. On the basis of unity and solidarity, I think that now this time around that we are faced with global challenges again. It's a great opportunity to be able to move forward. The world is a big hit. We have always been a part of the war at the doorstep of Europe. We should react with the same principles. That entails additional debt issuance or not. We will see. Not you, Kelvin, the Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, answering Mahamadal Aerian yesterday. I noticed that. I love having Mahamad on the program with me. We've done it a few times over the years. He always asks better questions than I do. I try and aim back the interview. the time. I think it's a good idea to say this about Tim Adams a little bit early this morning that Tim Adams is much better at doing this than maybe some journalist. He said that we would lose our jobs if he keeps breaking rules. Hey Tom, do you think Tim Adams wants to be an anchor on Blueburg surveillance when you're out? Well, he's smooth. There's no question about it. The gentleman from Kentucky can absolutely get it done for that matter, John. I thought Axel Weber was smooth as well. Great. You thought John Feral unwrote we heard from the leader of the Bundesbank. Well, Tom, I think that a lot of what we're experiencing right now is some of the things that we've been experiencing right now. We've been working on that for about 10 years ago that once you go down this path, it's very difficult to get back out of it. From the ultra-commonative to where we are right now, it is indeed historic. What I've heard this morning folks is this is a once in 40, even 50 year moment for all within finance and global Wall Street. If you're part of global Wall Street, this is must listen. It is rare that you speak to anyone in economics who actually read chapter 23 of a textbook which is on finance and bonds. Claude Connote is a governor of the Dutch Central Bank and is truly expert in linking in economics to the fixed income space, including British yields at 5%. Governor, thank you so much for joining Bloomberg today. I've got a first go to the ECB questions. Can you explain to me how the ECB can become more restrictive raised right 75 basis points with the nominal GDP construction of the continent? Where do they have the animal spirit to withstand ever higher interest rates? Well, I think to answer that question, you first have to sort of look at where we are in terms of the starting point. We're still way below neutral, so policy is still accommodative. So I think it is no regret that we have to end this accommodative phase of policy. And I mean, your question of how deep should we go into restrictive territory once we get there? Well, we cross that bridge when we get there. Well, we cross that bridge when",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2141,2022-10-12 12:23:47
13916," face of policy. And I mean your question of how deep should we go into a restrictive territory once we get there? Well, we cross that bridge when we get there. It is original. Right now you're in a commadae that are ultra-comadae of however you want to phrase it as well. What happens next after the presumed rate increase of the next meeting? Well, I mean our president has stated very clearly that we are currently in the face of normalizing interest rates. That means taking them to neutral. Unfortunately nobody knows with any level of precision where neutral is but I've been saying that we need at least two more significant hikes before we sort of enter the range of plausible estimates for neutral. That will take us into next year and I hope that with the current uncertainty in the markets and the bond market fragility I hope you don't mind that I don't have my calendar cut out for 2023 already. I don't know. I don't know my calendar cut out for 2022 even even some of my staff would say that I don't know where the calendars for this year as well. I stood at the ECB building with Omar Ising long ago and far away. It was a core let's call it Germanic Netherlands constituency wrapped around another ECB. In this crisis right now is the ECB more unified than it was in 2008. We are unified so I think if you look back over the last few years since the pandemic all decisions have been taken with a high degree of unanimity so we are very clear about our mandate. Inflation is way too high. It is 11% and another. 17% in the Netherlands. 10% in the Euro area and even more important underlying inflation trends are pointing in the wrong direction core inflation almost 5%. So we are determined to bring inflation back to target and we do understand that this will require some further efforts from our site. This problem is not going to go away with a little bit of slowdown of the economy. It will require continued effort from our site and the council is unanimous on that. I have to go with you to your bond expertise linking it into a greater economic system and the idea of yields coming up prices coming down with the United Kingdom and the headlines this morning it'll be another country next. These are nonlinear functions. How closer we to a second derivative to a convexity and acceleration where people like you lose control? Well I think that need not be the case because that is dependent I think on responsible policy. As long as policy makers keep on doing the responsible things then I do think bond markets can be in control but it does put a premium on responsible behavior. Bond markets have become much much more sensitive to debt sustainability issues so that puts a burden on our fiscal authorities to also continue to pursue responsible fiscal policies with the medium term orientation and with that sustainability being front and center of their concerns. Is there a textbook on QT when you're at ground again? Was there anything about QE and QT? No you're making it up as we go right? Well we're making it up as we go yes of course we learn from the experiences of all the central banks. I think the way the fat is dealing with QT that's clearly also going to be an example for us and they managed to move it into the background very quickly. I think a process like QT it should be predictable it should be gradual it should be even a little bit boring right I mean Janet Dillon once quiped it's like watching paint dry and that's a little bit I think how you want to shape such a program I think the fat has been fairly successful in that and if we can take that Q as well I would be more than happy to do so. It has not been boring for governor Bailey he's making it up as he goes literally in the last 24 hours what is the lessons you learned from the the nexus of Bank of England and politics in England what have you learned about when that first of all that monetary and fiscal policy being at crossroads with at cross purposes with each other that's a very dangerous cocktail for for bond markets that's the first lesson that I would say and secondly the UK is a little bit in a special position because the bonds they bought are extremely long dated so they actively have to sell we in the Euro area like in the US and we have bonds over the full maturity and we think we can do",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2142,2022-10-12 12:26:28
13917," Bored are extremely long dated, so they actively have to sell. We in the Euro area, like in the US, and we have bonds over the full maturity, and we think we can do QT by just rolling off existing bonds by less than full reinvestment, which is naturally a smoother process than having to actively sell. My colleague John Farrow adores Vermeer. You're having the mother of all lifetime Vermeer shows in the Netherlands next year. Can you see our show in Amsterdam in support of the Vermeer show? Yes, of course. I mean, if you want to support it by all means, I think it's a unique opportunity to see all the Vermeers that are everywhere in the world in a different museum, in the Reichs Museum in Amsterdam. Absolutely. We would love to have you in Mr. Ruder's show. You would be more than welcome to come and enjoy our show. There goes John Roacher. Claus, come out of the Dutch Central Bank, suggesting we need to be in Amsterdam next year. Yeah, it was his suggestion, son. I'm buying that. What is there always a trip involved somewhere? He's on a road trip bidding for another road trip, and he's saying it's his suggestion because there was a Vermeer show, didn't you hear of Ben Chinette? He left out the bit about which bar he'd like to go to in Amsterdam. I'd love some more detail on that. You know, John, he's usually been to one. To be honest, that point that was being made just there from the Central Banker was the same that we heard from Axel Weber, which is this ultimately comes down to physical policymakers being disciplined. That's where it goes. Point, the second point. Let's talk about the aspirational goals of the Central Bankers. That's the other point. QT paint drying. Yeah, come on. It's really... Give me a break. It's really... Yeah, Quintilla and Kong. Yeah..... So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the market is on to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. The markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. It's talked about it is now up about 45% a lot of volatility right now. We need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. Conceeing shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported at sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's is your true mission. I'm from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany.

13918," The world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. All Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hole, kiss-n-ass, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to sue progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the ball. This is a fad that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Tomorrow on Bloomberg. CPI coming up tomorrow, about 24 hours away. Seconds away is PPI in America. The equity market was shaping up as follows, going into those two prints. P500 positive by a tenths of 1%. You're coming in a couple of basis points on a 10 year, the 39268. I can tell you on PPI, final demand, month over month, upside-surprise, 0.4%. A median estimate, 0.2%. Year over year, 8.5. A median estimate, 8.4. I was reading food. I can strip out food and energy for you. X food and energy month over month, positive 0.3. Basically in line with estimates there. X food, energy and trade, 0.4. We were looking for 0.2. If you want to do the year over year for food and energy, 7.2. Just below the 7.3, we were looking for. Let's get out to Mike McKee now to break down some of this data. Mike, I guess my first question for you as this data simmers and we look ahead to CPI. How relevant is this data when we think about tomorrow's? It's not particularly relevant because the PPI doesn't feed directly into CPI. The middlemen get in the way, but it does tell us something about inflation pressures in the pipeline. And it's telling us there are still inflation pressures in the pipeline. So it's not going to make anybody on Wall Street happy. CPI is going to be the big number of the week. It's probably not going to change any minds at the Fed unless there's a major surprise. They're pretty locked in on the idea of 75 basis points in November. But it will give us breakdowns of where inflation is still heavy. And that's going to be important for the way the Fed thinks about what it's got to do. Because it has to be able to make sure that monetary policy will actually have an impact. And certainly with gasoline prices, things like that, it doesn't. On peripheral conversations that I've been having, there is a growing fear that we have not seen peak inflation. And it's certainly core will continue to gain. And we're talking about CPI, given these PPI numbers coming in higher than expected mic in your conversations at IIF and IMF. How much is that a pervasive worry? You know, it's kind of evenly divided. There are people who think that this is going to take a very long time. And I've talked to a number of central bankers. They're all over the place here in Washington. And they all feel that it is going to be a long road till you get inflation back down to target. That doesn't mean that we haven't seen peak inflation. Could come this month might have already happened. But it is not going to go down very quickly. And that's going to be the important thing. And that's the argument that the Fed officials make is we've got to get our target rate up to a restrictive stance and keep it there. Because if we get up and start cutting, we're going to see inflation just stay high and not keep going down. So that'll be the tug of war that gets into the market coming next, whether we've hit peak this month or next month. It's going to be about how long you keep rates high. How sticky will this story be? All round, Mike McKee, thank you. Looking forward to Mike's coverage through the week. Dan in Washington alongside Tom Keane. And now we've all got a home bias. And being in New York, he's in the rents. The story August year over year. Latest data. We were up in August 19% for rents. 19% higher. The national number was 12%.

13919," We were up in August 19% for rent 19% higher the national number was 12% Any particular neighborhoods that got your attention? No, not on the personal level Full neighborhood right down for you, but the overall number. Yeah, pretty big It's massive in this really space to this concern that even as mortgage rates go to the highest levels in 16 years You're seeing 7% rates being cited 6.8% average rates on that mortgage level Yes, you're getting some softness in the purchasing market But on the rent side that forced more people to actually rent rather than oh and that's what you're seeing the stickiness of that Feeding into CPI is going to be persistent. But the Fed's going to pause Thank you for that. I haven't well How many times how many times that come up the Fed's gonna pause well and this well hold on a second because there is this other argument I'm more than a second hall crewman actually putting out Twitter 3 at thread echoing what Leo Brainerd was saying and I think this is important How much emphasis will there be on the ambiguity of lag time of how long it takes for some of the tightening that we've already seen to make its way into the financial system Into the economy I should say this is going to be the pushback not necessarily that yes You can pause because CPI is coming in but we can pause because we have not yet seen the impact of what we've already done I was 45 I promised thank you anymore. No, I'm good. You good. You want to go to Conrad? Sure Hi Conrad has it go and you want to save me Conrad De Quadro Senior Economic Advisor and Green Capital You know, so let's start there this question of do you see that as a reasonable argument that the lag time is so significant That it would make sense for the Fed to pause at the risk of them really causing a huge recession outweighs The risks that the tightening that they've done already is insufficient to combat inflation Well Lisa, I think the question of lags is a very important one Unfortunately the Fed didn't consider that on the other end of this when we were heading into this inflation problem We had some signs that inflation was picking up and they they waited too long They didn't appreciate the lags of their prior accommodative policy So I think that that that only that means we should ignore the fact that there are lags on the other side as well But I just think it's too too soon to consider that I think it's very helpful that the Fed has started to consider the stance of policy in terms of real policy rates And we have it with tomorrow we're going to get CPI but as of the last CPI report based on CPI We have a real policy rate that's still minus 5% And to me that is not a tight stance of policy. It's less easy than it was several months ago Um, with the Fed moving rate higher and with some of the inflation rates on the headline measures coming down a bit But it's still easy and so my question is Can we get inflation or 8.5% PPI inflation in 2019 before we got into all of this that that rate was 1.5% Is policy tight enough to bring inflation back down to those kind of levels? And do we is it too soon to start considering lags and in my opinion is that these kind of inflation rates it is Come on Joe go and further than that You're not asking whether it's tight enough. You're asking whether it's tight at all. Are you saying we're still not restrictive? I don't think restrictive yet. I can't look at a real policy rate of minus 5% And think that that's that that's a restrictive rate You know that the the issues here we don't really know where neutral is And we have different ways of of trying to assess it And I think that looking at real rates is one way to do it Um, and then the other way is just look at some of the measures that we're seeing that I think are relevant for inflation So you know inflation inflation modelings extremely difficult Um, but if we look at some of the things that gave us clues that there was an inflation problem coming um business surveys for example last week we had the ISM services survey 68% of firms still seeing rates or rising prices um, you know that was in the in the low 50s prior Uh prior to to covid um this this week we got the NFIB survey we have 50% of firms that are still raising prices Um, that was in the 20s prior to to covid and these are still very uh, I think worrying signals on the inflation front and and and assign to me that that policy Uh in a broad sense as a gotten tight I mean obviously in with respect to certain sectors I mean that what what has happened in the housing market um, I think conditions there have gotten have gotten very tight But more broadly speaking um, even if we look at that things like financial conditions where you know measures of financial conditions not suggesting that we're materially tight",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2145,2022-10-12 12:39:37
13920," They have gotten very tight, but more broadly speaking, even if we look at things like financial conditions, we're, you know, measures of financial conditions, not suggesting that we're materially tighter than where we had financial conditions, say, in 2018. And we have a completely different inflationary environment. Now we're trying to get policy tight enough to bring inflation down, not tight enough to maintain price stability. We don't have price stability yet. This next question is pertinent, I think, to the conversation we're having. I'm going to try another concept that is pretty fuzzy and no one really knows where it is. But when do you even the team suppose, Nairu is? Well, you know, that's a difficult one. And the only way that we'll really look at at Nairu is not in terms of inflation, but in terms of potential wage pressures. I mean, we've always questioned the link between the tightness of labor market and inflation, because it ignores business pricing power and the ability of businesses to pass on higher wages that might come from a tight labor market into inflation. And so I think that the labor market is tight and we're seeing rising wages, we're seeing, you know, we'll get a measure from the land to Fed that I think is much more useful for wage growth. Their median wage measure will come out this week. Last week we saw still 5% or so increases in average wages. The median measures are running more like seven. So the labor market is tight and putting up a pressure on wages. And that I think is part of the story, along with things like this PPI report, feeding through into inflation, because we still have policy that is not yet tight. And so, and I think we'll get to tight policy. And you're right, John. The Fed is eventually going to pause. We don't know what point that is. Our feeling is that pausing at around 4.5% is going to look increasingly difficult. Given that inflation is probably still going to be pretty elevated in the early part of next year and they'll be close to 4.5% on the Fed funds rate by the early part of next year. But the other aspect of all of this is of course what's going on in financial markets and the conflict between financial stability and inflation fighting. And we've seen it most notably in the UK where we have this very bizarre situation where markets are expecting the Bank of England to raise rates by 100 basis points at their next meeting and the bank has resumed QE. So, you know, that is where I think the greater uncertainty is. Does the pause come because the central banks can do it because inflation has come down enough or does it kind of come because they're forced to do it because there's financial stability? And there's two different consequences for markets without a doubt there. Conrad, thank you. Conrad DeCorte is there of Brent Capital. It's even more bizarre than the way he framed it because of course they've started a new bond bank operation over the Bank of England. It's just ahead of high-can-interest rates maybe by 100 basis points and somewhere in between the momentum start QT. Which is still on the schedule. Just get your head around this. It's still on the schedule. It's impossible. You know, what Conrad was saying is on the way to tighter policy what happens if you have a financial stability problem? What is the policy response if you're still trying to get to tighter policy? And basically his argument is you need to keep going and we're not there yet but we're getting close. Or except for inflation. Yeah, exactly. Is that the end goal? Something has to give. It's what we called it a trilema yesterday. You can support growth. You want to try and bring down inflation and preserve financial stability. Can you do all three things? Very difficult to do. Most people conclude by saying no you can't. So what gives you ultimately end up in a place where you have to accept high inflation for longer. And based on communication we've heard from these guys right now, they don't want to go there. Well, high inflation for longer is not necessarily a very good thing for the stock market. And that is something that I think people are grappling with as well. If you look at the earnings, strip out monetary policy. What is the negative effect just purely on an inflationary basis? I'm just going to see PPI not markets the way it just has done. Futures, but over and over. Going into CPI tomorrow. We're now positive just about a 10th of 1% on ESMP.

NATO defense chiefs are meeting in Brussels today to discuss how to better protect critical infrastructure, ramp up weapon production and maintain support for Ukraine. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won, must never be fought. And we are of course also close in monitoring. The Russian nuclear posture. We haven't seen any changes in the nuclear posture of Russia, but we will remain vigilant. Meanwhile, the U.S. is speeding up shipment of two advanced air defense systems to Ukraine in response to President Vladimir Zelensky's pleas for more weaponry in the fight against Russia.

What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we look at big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, in that other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.

13922," The deal was the brainchild of Apollo CEO Mark Rowan. In January, Apollo closed its $11 billion all-stock merger with a theme holding. It had already owned 35% of the insurer. Here's what Apollo gets out of the deal. Assets under management. Apollo expects them to double to about a trillion dollars by 2026. Much of that projected growth will come from the merger. And those assets are especially attractive to Apollo. Insurance companies typically go after much more modest returns than buyout investors. That will give Apollo more options for investing the cash. A theme is a steady provider of fee income. It has grown into one of the nation's biggest holders of fixed annuities. Those retirement savings products favored by risk adverse customers. The merger will also allow Apollo to simplify its governance. It gave up its dual-class share structure and adopted a one-share one-vote plan. The hope is that will eventually lead to Apollo's inclusion in the S&P 500. The central banks are in a really bad situation. They have started late in raising rates. And now the central banks are doing big steps to catch up with reality. And there is some risk in that. I now look at monetary policy as an independent risk factor. And I think monetary policy has a way to go. Axel Weber, there speaking with our own Tom Keane down in Washington, DC. At the IIF meetings, really a compelling suite of different conversations at a time of incredible change. Where suddenly people are reassessing the role of monetary policy in a newly inflationary world. Right now, what we are seeing in this newly inflationary world is that any upside surprise when it comes to inflation reads the latest being PPI. Not necessarily considered a major indicator. Still, the knee jerk response was stocks lower off the highs of the session. And bond yields just a slight bit higher. You're seeing a little bit of a retracement back S&P futures up about three to four, a tenths of a percent, 36, 13. You're seeing the Euro decline versus the dollar week in 97, 06. And you are seeing crude just off in a little bit after some discussion from OPEC Plus that they expect demand to be lower this year because of just the deceleration. Right now, let's head back down to Washington, DC, Tom Keane with another fantastic interview. A nice update there, Lisa. And it's really important folks off PPI is how important tomorrow's United States CPI numbers will be for these meetings of the World Bank, the IIF and the international monetary fund. Tomorrow will come from the offices of the international monetary fund with some important interviews. Right now, we go all American and we can do that. If you go to the Art Institute of Chicago and go to the very back of the Art Institute, pass the shagall, there is the old trading room of the Chicago commodity exchange.

Wonderful to have you here with us today. Have you ever visited that spiritual room in the back of the Art Institute? I have not and I look forward to it. Is newly minted commissioner. You must go to the Art Institute and go to the back and there is part of my family's past. I'm headed to Chicago in November. You have to see it. Let's add to your list now the discussion.

13923," How can you to get along on what to do with Bitcoin and not make it a silly turf for it? Oh, this is a great question and not just a great one a necessary one. To be honest, in the current crypto onset of the current crypto winner, a $2 trillion asset sell off. What comes sharply into focus from my perspective is institutional investors and retail investors. Starting with the latter, in fact, what we could think carefully about is the reality that retail investors have suffered significant losses in light of the onset of this crypto winner. Something else I'd share is if we coupled this thinking with the Bank of New York's announcement yesterday, this is Alexander Hamilton's bank, founded as one of the oldest in the history of our nation, now acknowledging that it will on its platform service, not only conventional financial products, but cryptocurrencies. Suggesting and signaling that in the near and not so distant future, institutional investors will be investing in this space as well. What's good about this, folks, is they kept from Commissioner Johnson, my thoughts on Bitcoin and we're not going there right now. There's a guy, used to work at JPMorgan and there's this guy up on the 100th floor named Diamond, who's going both ways on Bitcoin. He's saying this is a fraud, and excuse me, Jamie, but something like that. The other thing is we need to learn about this and do about it. How can CFTC do better than SEC at helping banks on this is a fraud versus this is what we need to do to move forward? Let me explain what the CFTC is already doing. What are you right now? In our remit, we are enforcing to the fullest extent of our authority to ensure against fraud, market manipulation, any types of abuse to retail customers who are heavily engaged, as I mentioned in this market. So that includes first of their kind lawsuits for pump and dump schemes over the last several months, first of their kind, Bitcoin or cryptocurrency asset management fund scams against retail investors and very, very recently, a first of its kind suit against a decreased centralized autonomous organization. This is so important. Bitcoin, 60,000 down to 20,000 is well. The little guy, and I've seen this folks generational, they fervently believe in Bitcoin. Are they believing in a derivative instrument, the province of the CFTC, or are they believing maybe in a financial asset under SEC 34 and 36, I think? Is it an SEC province thing or is it a derivative thing of CFTC? Your question about whether or not the Securities Act Section 2A1 definition of a secure security, in Trump's question, what's the issue in Section 821B? So essentially what we're asking is what qualifies as a security. And in fact, there are two bipartisan bills currently pending in Congress that are working diligently, Senate staffers working diligently to capture and answer to this question. It's a wonderful question that's rich and reflective of the history of financial markets regulation in our nation in 1946. Why can't you two, God? I'm an interim. Why can't you two get along? I can't the SEC and the CFTC both work on this, which I do be as thin, 60,000 down to 20,000. I'm going to say we better get along. For the sake of those investors that I referenced earlier, there is a path. And we've walked that path before. Have you spoken to Mr. Gensel recently about this? I have had the great opportunity to engage with his office, with him, with other commissioners at the SEC. I think we are all in agreement and on one accord that we want to protect market integrity and protect the customers who are engaged in investing. You came with an honor, a large of 20 people. So typical as CFTC. And someone in your honor, I said, don't ask her about the politicians. So let's talk about the politicians. Let's talk about the politicians. Are they in the backseat of all the rich guys doing Bitcoin? These gazillion, they used to have $40 gazillion and now they have $8 gazillion. The eight gazillionaires that are doing Bitcoin, are they buying off the American politicians? I can only tell you what I know, which is Chairwoman of the Senate Ag Committee, Debbie Semanal, I'm a native Michigander. So we are neighbors in many respects. I believe that she is deeply engaged in expanding the remit of the CFTC over spot market transactions for the purpose of ensuring that regulatory gap that exists right now is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2149,2022-10-12 12:56:53
13924," They believe that she is deeply engaged in expanding the remit of the CFTC over spot market transactions for the purpose of ensuring that a regulatory gap that exists right now is closed. I got 30 seconds. What happens to the retail investors if Bitcoin breaks support 19,000 and goes down to 16 or 15 or 12? What's the ramifications of that? The ramifications are significant because those investors are the most critical in my humble opinion in our markets and our most sacred task is to ensure the protection of those investors and the integrity of our markets. So I am diligently committed. Whatever we have to do. Commissioner, I'm exhausted Lisa. Commissioner, thank you so much. I'm just in Johnson of the CFTC there on section 12 item two way one. Two way one. Two way one Lisa. Wonderful interview.

13925," For a young person who now booking in a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, with you're always, always learning. You need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the Open with Jonathan Perra. A life from New York, we begin with a big issue. Next up, CPI. As we had in Shua, CPI this week. We have a big release this week, CPI. This is very important data print. The Fed has been very explicit until we see concrete signs of inflation peaking. They are going to be done left to slowing in the economy. If we have an outside surprise, it could reinforce the resolve of the Fed to over tighten. That's the risk. We could get another 75 basis points. If we have a downside surprise, one data point is not going to sway them. The markets have been looking for any window of change in Pivot, and I just don't think it's there. There's no Pivot. The Fed has got to keep going. It's all about the Fed. It's all about central banks. The difficulty of balancing growth inflation and financial stability. Certainly we'll be watching that CPI release. That CPI release coming tomorrow morning. Joining us now is G-Square. It's Victoria Greene, Colin Martin, a child swap victoria. First of you, PPI coming in hot. But even the same looking for tomorrow morning. I don't think that votes well for 8.1 or 7 print. I think that means it's going to come in high. I think housing is going to be an issue that may come in stronger. Of course, CPI continues to grow mostly because of the housing problem. Looking forward, PPI does not vote well for a good print tomorrow. Colin, you agree? I do agree. Today's hotter than expected PPI. It doesn't vote well for CPI tomorrow. What we're looking at is less about those year-over-year numbers and more about the month over month. When you look at Core CPI, it's still coming in hot on an annualized basis. I think we hear a lot of concerns about a potential Fed pivot or lack thereof. I think we can retire that. We know it's not coming. The question now is how long does this high inflation persist? The Fed needs to see concrete evidence that it's going to start coming down. All we're seeing some signs today's PPI report doesn't help. If we see a higher than expected Core CPI number tomorrow, that's a risk that the Fed will not just continue to be aggressive, but be maybe aggressive longer than people are expected. They keep hiking. This is what Bob Michael at JPMorgan Asset Management had to say to the team here at Bloomberg. When the central bank steps on the brakes, something goes through the windshield. The cost of financing has gone up. It will create tension in the system. I put that to Mahamad Al-Ehrin yesterday who said going through the windshield right now was the economy. It was the financial system as well. Colin, can you give me your view on that? What is going through the windshield right now? Sure. That's a risk we see. We phrase it a different way. We say when the Fed hikes things break. Frankly, we haven't started to see too many things break just yet. Yes, obviously stock prices are down. When we look at things like the credit markets, they are holding up better than we would expect them to hold up. And that's where we see a key risk right now. When you look at the rise in borrowing costs, what that means for corporations, rising input costs, rising labor costs, but we just continue to grow. Those are huge key risks for the credit markets. When you look at spreads, however, they're kind of still hanging in there. When you look at a say 5, 5 and a quarter percent spread for high yield bonds, when we look at previous peaks of 8 percent plus during periods of market volatility, slow-rachonomic growth, we think that's a key risk. And even though we've seen a modest uptick in high yield spreads lately, that's something that we're focusing on going for. And we think we'll see those spreads rise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2151,2022-10-12 13:05:31
13926," I think that's a key risk. And even though we've seen a modest uptick and high yield spreads lately, that's something that we're focusing on going forward. And we think we'll see those spreads rise and high yield bond prices fall. There's a ton of timing in the pipeline. We had a new low for 2022 and yesterday session on the S&P 5568 on the S&P 500. You know the story, Victoria, there's people just itching to buy this still. They just want to get in there, get away from cash and start buying stocks again. They're waiting for that Fed pivot to like flash the green light and say, go, go, go. You pushing back against that, aren't you? Yeah, I don't really see it until the 32, 3,400 level. I think you're still early, you know, I think everybody is hoping for this pivot, but the pivot is dead. You know, we say long live or the rate hikes because that's what's coming. You got 7550, probably 25. I mean, the concern is the lag in the economy, typically unemployment doesn't start going up for like another 12 months. We had that weird jolt reading, not weird, but a very, very big fall in jolt. So we're seeing the effects and the problem is the late effects when they go this hard this fast tends to make it very hard to make us off landing. And when we talk about credit spreads and what's happening in the markets, it's just not there yet. You don't have your capitulation. You are fighting a very hawkish Fed. You know, everybody's a little bit excited about what's happening in the UK, just because maybe that liquidity problem there starts to bleed in here. And we've already said the only two things that will stop the Fed is liquidity issues or unemployment rising. And we haven't seen either one of those yet in the US, but we have seen a little bit bleeding in in the UK, John. And I'm sure you're aware, you know, the three days and what's happening over there. I mean, the only good thing that came with that is the memes because that's been marked, you know, you can't really put people on the clock. It creates this chaos. So I do applaud slightly the B-O-E in the UK for making the US look a little bit more functional these days, so I'll take it. Governor Bailey, making it pretty clear. You've got three days. We've announced that we'll be out by the end of this week. We think the rebalancing must be done. And my message to the funds involved and all the firms involved in much of those funds, you've got three days left now. You've got to get this done. Because again, part of the essence of I think of a financial stability intervention is that it is clearly temporary. One report calling that timeline into question, the FT, reporting the B-O-E, signal to bankers earlier this week, it could extend purchases past Friday, a spokesperson for the central bank pushing back, saying temporary and targeted purchases of guilt will end on October 14th. It has been made absolutely clear in contact with the banks at senior levels. Guy Johnson had a London joint just now for more. Guy, I think all of our heads are just spinning. Absolutely. So it's worth probably taking a step back thinking about what is happening here. Clearly the Bank of England wanted to disabuse the market of any idea that there is going to be any kind of extension. That FT report probably was the catalyst for that. Does make you, that was a very infantic statement, wasn't it, from the governor? Makes you wonder what information they are getting from the market. The plan that they've put in place in some ways hasn't been effective. And there are a number of reasons for that. In some ways, it's very different to QE. They are not price agnostic. The other thing is, John, that a lot of this is about the unwinding of swaps. So you need to collateral for the swaps, which then obviously has a counterparty, which you've got to deal with, and you can settle the swap with them, but you can't settle the swap with anybody else. So you have to put yourself in a position where you're selling guilt in order to raise the collateral in order to make the call on those swaps. So the bank can't solve the swap problem directly, but it's trying its best. And it's going to be interesting to see next week if we get the repo operation functioning via the commercial banks, whether or not that's going to do any better. But at the moment, I'm surprised that the Bank of England is pushing as hard as it is on this one. I think a lot of people are surprised that the Bank of England is pushing on this one as hard as it is. We've still got to wait until we get the report from the Office of Budget Responsibility here in the UK. And we've also got to get, obviously, to that next rate hike from the Bank of England. So there's a huge period of uncertainty. So John, yeah, the price action this morning was extraordinary. I think that was because the bank basically said that FT report, there's nothing doing there. It's nuts right now. The 10-year-up 17 basis points, the 460, the 30-year-old up 27 basis points, north to 5%. These are the levels that we were looking at back in the end of September, and in some cases, in some maturities, we're through it. Guys, do you get the sense? And I understand this is difficult to do, but this is the challenge at the moment. Do you get the sense from them that they're worried about contributing to perceived fiscal dominance? And that's why they're pushing back so hard here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2152,2022-10-12 13:10:17
13927," It's difficult to do, but this is the challenge at the moment. Do you get the sense from them that they're worried about contributing to perceived fiscal dominance? And that's why they're pushing back so hard here? Absolutely, John, absolutely. You listen to what Hugh Pill has been saying up in Glasgow today, the chief economist. He is making it very clear that he thinks currently the fiscal position is going to be inflationary. They need to lean in on that. They are going to raise rates aggressively to deal with that. They want to make sure, and this is why they've structured this programme in the way that they've structured it, is that this is not QE, and you should not perceive it as QE. Now, I think, once again, you take a step back, it looks awfully like QE, but they're trying to find ways of making it not look like QE. The way they've structured it, they are not price agnostic. They don't have to take your bid. They are making it very clear that this is not QE. So I think that understanding is real, and I think that may be contributing to their desire to get out of this on time. Now, whether or not that is the right call, I don't know. But the government has sounded very emphatic there, which does slightly make me wonder as well, whether he knows something else as to what is happening in the market at the moment, just how many funds are affected by this problem? They're not backing away. The government's not backing away either. Guy Johnson, what a month lined up in the United Kingdom. So, October 14th, the Guilt Market Operation is set to end on Friday. End of the month on Halloween, get a fiscal announcement from the government, and you get some forecast from the OBR as well, that on November 3rd, you get a bank having the right decision. Colin Martin, I wonder if it plays out that way, or whether we have to get a decision before that. We could, I think the key point right now is uncertainty. And as Guy was talking about, there's a fine line between QE, QT, and really just helping provide market stability. I think things happening in between meetings certainly can't be ruled out, but it's very fluid right now. The way we're approaching it right now on the domestic side, on the US side, is that it just throws a wrench in our investment outlook, and really the global investment outlook. When you look across the globe, at global growth concerns, sky high inflation everywhere, and now other central banks needing to intervene in their markets, it just shows that there are these issues all over the place, and everyone's focusing on fixing something in their territory and their region. So right now, anything can happen when we look at it with the Fed. Obviously, a big question is, well, what's happening with the dollar, what impact does that have globally? They've told us that they're focused on inflation right now, and as we saw this morning, and as we'll see with tomorrow's CPI report, we really view that as a key driver along with the US labor market. Victoria, you know the question that I've heard a few times on this side of the pond, it's, it's, why do I care? Why do I care what's happening in the guild market? What does it matter to me and my allocations here in the United States? Should they care? Yes, they should. I mean, it does matter. The UK is a very large market, both on the financial markets as well, as what they provide globally. So the UK and the EU, we're not immune. If they catch a cold, we're gonna sneeze too. And so you have to look at that and realize it is all interconnected. And when you have a currency crisis or a bond market crisis, it tends to affect every other market as well. And so we are, we can't be agnostic to what's happening over there. And you have to also say, how much is this gonna be something that happens in the US? You know, how much do we have to be concerned about liquidity drying up and having some sort of lock up in the fixed income markets? Obviously, treasury markets have still remained very liquid and relative to the rest of the world, you know, they're hanging in their guild vites. Obviously, the two year, at four three, is extremely expensive. And, you know, we have 40 basis points in version. So you have to say recession and even Biden tacitly understanding that a recession is coming when the president realizes and says out loud and says the words, the quiet part out loud, that yes, we may have a softer session. That tends to mean that the data is very poor. So it's going to matter, you know, and look at what Yellen said yesterday. The US dollar is probably gonna continue to go up because of our policies here. We have a relatively strong economy. We have a very strong currency. And if you look at what happening with sterling and with the yen, I mean, the yen's trading back to where they did intervention in 98. So what's gonna happen over there? So I think you have to realize it is all interconnected and it does matter. Victoria Green, Colin Martin, sticking with us coming up on this program, the president, drop in the R word. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. That is, we'll move down slightly.

They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to move. They're new for the machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Companies have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision that creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris. As we add all of the new satellites into space, the risks of the collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities. What are for you to change the world from Bloomberg?

We've done a better position than any other major country in the world. The president acknowledged the risk of recession and downplaying the risk of recession at the same time. Secretary Yellen promoting the strength of the economy, as you might expect, saying this, the U.S. is doing very well. We have to continue to have a very resilient economy and economy that's slowing, but something we expected fully after a very strong recovery. Our remain encouraged. The Secretary of the Treasury is speaking to CNBC just yesterday. AMH, we're just right here in New York City. Secretary Yellen, I have to say the story that they're selling going into the midterms gets a little bit harder to sell. Yeah, it does, especially after you see what's happening with producer prices just today. But the president is saying is that he's downplaying this risk of a recession. But what president is going to forecast a recession four weeks before the midterm elections. One thing they are leaning into, Jonathan, is the robust job market and the labor market. 3.5 percent unemployment rate. What they continuously say is that this administration added 10 million jobs. Now Mike McKee would say 10 million jobs were recovered because the economy was completely battered. But this is what you're going to lean into. The issue is, you and I do not feel our neighbor getting a new job. What we do feel is gas prices going up, food prices going up, and our rent prices going up. And just for a moment, we quickly juxtaposed this position. Just a few blocks from the White House. You have the IMF saying the worst is yet to come. And that in 2023, everyone will feel like they're living in a recession. Politically, that's not a message you want to send right now. And we know how the international story is believing into the domestic one, which Saudi Arabia very much in focus for this administration. Take a listen to what the president had to say. There's going to be some consequences.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2154,2022-10-12 13:18:24
13929," The national story is believing into the domestic one with Saudi Arabia very much in focus for this administration. Take a listen to what the president had to say. There's going to be some consequences for what they've done with Russia. What kind of consequences? Menendez says suspend all arms sales. Is that something you'd consider? I'm not going to get into what I'd consider and what I'm having mine, but there will be consequences. There are many reasons AMH to think about reassessing the relationship with Saudi Arabia. It's curious to me that this was the line of the sand for so many people. Yeah, it is interesting, especially given the fact that before the president made this historic trip, many, especially on his own party, the progressives in his party, were saying you should not go there based on human rights concerns. Now they are looking at reassessing it after an OPEC decision. And in this interview, the president gave to CNN. He also talked about the fact that he wanted to make it clear. He wanted to set the record straight. He was not going to the kingdom because of oil. Yet, given the fact that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC cut production, now they are thinking of recalibrating it. But if the trip wasn't about oil, why are you recalibrating the relationship? The fact of the matter is there are two things the administration could do or Congress can do, because right now, Jonathan, what you're hearing from both sides of the aisle is that they are very upset with Riyadh. No peck is coming back. This could potentially mean if the president were to sign it, and this legislation is revised and passed off on a bicameral basis, that the U.S. government could go after these producing countries from manipulating the market. And then, of course, there's things like arm sales. Yet they want to manipulate the market at the same time. I can't get my head around it. Well, as you are oil price cap. What's that? These are things that... That's managing the market. This is what producers will tell you back. This is what they will say. This is their argument. I'm Marie, down in DC. Up in New York this morning. I'm Marie, thank you. Victoria Greene. Colin Martin back with us. Victoria, let's start here, just with a question first. Do you get the sense what is happening in the energy market? Is it one off-shock or a big permanent adjustment that we need to adjust to? I think it's going to be a bit permanent, especially with what's happening with Russia. So, you know, part of the Saudi cuts were really a head-loan cut, because they really only had about a million barrels they're cutting because they were under-producing, and they were concerned on demand. It certainly was a slap in the face to the Biden administration. I think they're going to have to release the SPR reserves, even though we're only at 416, you know, we're down to the 1980s levels. I think because of what's happening in Russia, we have new sanctions taking place, and what most people don't understand is that the sanctions taking place in November is about ensuring the cargoes. And the insurance or cargoes of oil, like I'm saying ridiculous, like 95 percent of it, comes from the UK and from Europe. So, if you can't ensure the cargo, the ships aren't going to run. And so, because of those sanctions, I think the last time that the Russia can ship oil out to get to Asia, which is where they've been selling, is the Asia and India, is something in late October, because at the time it takes the transit to Suez Canal. So, you're seeing suddenly the Russia market may completely shut down if they cannot ship on cargo ships that are insured, because nobody wants to insure it from the UK and Europe. So, I think this market is adjusting higher. You know, Saudi Arabia does seem to be aligning a little bit more with Russia, but you still have wild cards. You have Iran that obviously could come on board. That's right. They have a lot of production. They have a lot of floating storage. And then right now, the US have become a net exporter of crude oil and crude oil products. And so, it has been net beneficial to the US producers. It's not great for the US consumer. You know, we're up 30 cents in gasoline prices over the last 30 days. You know, oil prices back at 90, up about 13% here in October. So, yeah, got rising gas prices and going into an election is not good for anybody's political party. I can't worry about the policy makers approach to this, the time horizon they have. The administration is focused overwhelmingly on the midterms. The Europeans are focused overwhelmingly on getting through winter. I get it. That's the issue right in front of their face right now. But when you think about things, the way Victoria just framed them. Not as a one-off shock. Not as one winter, one war, but as something more permanent. You have to calibrate policy for that. And exhausting the SPR, going into something that is a permanent adjustment for the world economy, taking out Russian barrels. Collin mistakes happen. And I have to have to say, that I think you can take this beyond commodities. I think you can take it to the equity market as well. There are still a lot of people looking at this equity market. Treating stocks in this market regime, as just an aberration, that ultimately we return to the previous regime at some point in the next 12 months. Rates are going back down, and tackle, rep, it's the old playbook.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2155,2022-10-12 13:23:12
13930," stocks in this market regime as just an aberration that ultimately we return to the previous regime at some point in the next 12 months. Rates are going back down, Teckel Rip, it's the old playbook is coming out soon. Kotlin, do you push back against all two of those things? Both. Well, on the energy front and the length of time, the permanence, I think one thing that's important in this impact, at least policy from a Fed standpoint, if we have a prolonged period of elevated oil prices and elevated gas prices, we know that if the prices don't change, that doesn't impact the rate of inflation, right? But if the price is high, that has an impact if we're going into that dreaded hour, the recession. If growth does slow and we start to see the cost of borrowing rise, we start to see wage growth slow and consumers, as Victoria mentioned, are still kind of struggling at the pump, paying more for their electricity bills, gas, things like that. That has an impact, even if the rate of change has a change, or it's flat over the next year or so from a gas standpoint. Now, as it relates to the markets, I'll leave our colleagues at Schwab, like Lizanne Saunders to talk about the equity markets, but we're seeing in terms of what this means from a policy standpoint over the next few months, is ultimately we think that there's going to be a slowdown. We're seeing an inverted yield curve at some of its deepest and most inverted points in a long time. We don't expect a cut necessarily in the near term, mainly because most fed officials have told us that's not their plan, but at the end of the day, we do expect ramifications from everything that's going on both domestically and abroad. We do expect growth to slow from here on out, and there's a negative impact of these fed rate hikes, not just to fight inflation, but it makes the cost of borrowing more expensive. So we look ahead six months, 12 months, how the consumer is feeling. They might not be feeling as good in six or 12 months as they do right now. Hey Colin, good to catch up, sir. As always, Colin Martin, there alongside Victoria Green. Victoria, thanks for being with us here in New York. Your equity market, the S&P futures were up by about 1%, then I almost unchanged, up about a tenth of 1%, coming off the back of PPI numbers from about 50 minutes ago, coming in just a little bit harder than expected, anticipating now maybe the same thing from CPI, equity's fate going into that print anchor and into the market opened seven minutes away from the opening belt. Up next the morning calls and later, Wells Fargo's narrow crump, staying defensive to whether a looming US recession, Darrell joins us around the opening belt, that conversation, coming right up. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2156,2022-10-12 13:27:01

Crune back in away from a big rally last week with down by 1.4% $88 and around about 10 cents. With the open, let's get you some move this is Abbey. Well John, we do of course have earning season kicking off this week and ahead of the big banks. This morning PepsiCo put up a very strong quarter. The stock is popping sharply higher up 3.4%. They beat by mid single digits for both the sales and adjust in earnings. Really points to solid demand plus their ability to raise costs. Very important, they raise the outlook and it's interesting to get snack values fell but beverages higher overall again a very strong quarter. Take a look at Moderna, up 10.5% this on the news that their mRNA cancer vaccine development pact has been put in place with Merck. This means that there is life after COVID. Now let's take a look at big tech because this is interesting. Earlier all these stocks had been higher by about half a percent or more. Now Apple is just hanging on by a thread but you can see Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, all a little bit lower. This is we're talking about this double bear market. We're talking about this double bear market. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. I think it's one way to look at it though, John. The Nasdaq 100 really never left that bear market at the last high. It was still down about 18% in the strong downtrend. Down more than 36% and the story of the year re-tired. Well, that's hurting this morning again. Can we snap the losing street right now? We're struggling to. We're down to 10% of 1% on the S&P. A six day losing street. The longest since September 27th, which was about two weeks ago. Can we snap the losing street? That's a big deal. We're struggling to get the first look at the new S&P. The last thing we were going to do is to get the first look at the market. John, we're down. 10% on the Nasdaq 100. That didn't last long. We've been higher in futures the most of the morning until we got that PPI print. We know the logic that the Fed will remain aggressive with hikes in order to combat inflation. You look at what some of the markets doing, the chip sector also performing poorly coming off its worst run of declines in more than two weeks. From the index, the Philadelphia semiconductor index coming off its tech has been on this market, particularly in the context of energy. I know you've been talking about energy all morning. If you strip out energy from the S&P 500, you're down 27% year today. If you include it, you're down 25% year today. There's no difference when you're based on the waiting. The story of the last 12 hours has been Intel, according to sources, that chipmaker will cut thousands of jobs in the face of a PC, slow down. But beyond that, John, was kind of continuing on with this same narrative, continuing losses in the Nasdaq 100, as the data and the economic front continues to come in. Thank you. We're going to pick up on that Intel story a little bit later in the air. I had to download that, breaking down big tech. Acres down about a quarter of 1% on the S&P, pretty defensive stuff in the first couple of minutes, first three minutes to the session. We're up 8% of 1% on staples, staples out performing, healthcare, some relative out performance there as well. Profit warnings everywhere you look on Wall Street at the moment, they're just building this from UPS earlier this week, downgrading a number of auto makers and saying this, pricing power is at risk. We will shift from under supply to over supply and a flatish growth environment next year. Demand destruction is no longer a vague risk. Kayleigh has more. Hey, Kayleigh. Hey, John, how quickly the world changes. We went from a world of constrained supply where you had shipping bottlenecks and shortages, which meant we just didn't have enough stuff to meet demand. And therefore, companies could charge a whole lot more for the stuff they did have because people were willing to pay up. Now in an era of higher borrowing costs, tighter monetary policy, slowing growth, that is starting to change. And that is where margin pressure really could come in to stick on the autos, which UBS was talking about. You can see how come the second quarter of next year, we're expecting serious margin contraction from the levels we've seen in the second quarter of 2022 for the likes of four.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2158,2022-10-12 13:37:00
13933," I was what UBS was talking about. You can see how come the second quarter of next year, we're expecting serious margin contraction from the levels we've seen in the second quarter of 2022 for the likes of Ford, GM, and Volkswagen to elaborate on that UBS warning. It's essentially the idea that we're going to end up with oversupply as demand gets destructive. And they think that that will result in profits slumping by about half next year for US and European auto companies, which would basically mean that that inventory to sales ratio, that crashed due to supply shortages, could start to pick back up, because let's face it, there's a lot more expensive to finance a purchase of a car right now. And this extends well beyond autos, of course, chips, which Ed was just talking about is related to it, going from shortage to now, a title wave, it seems, of demand warnings. But we've seen it showing up in retail to the likes of Target, Walmart, cutting their profits out looks because they just have a glut of stuff now that people no longer want. The inventory mix is wrong, therefore, they have to cut prices, do discounting to bring that inventory down. That a bad thing for corporate profits. But in theory, John, that's exactly what the Federal Reserve wants to see. Precisely, in many places, many cases, this is the objective. Not the unintended consequences, the goal, Kelly Lines. Thank you. Darryl Krung of Wells Fargo Bracing for Thursday's inflation print that comes tomorrow morning. CPI core holding the line will be the headline of the week. And we'll put any remaining Fed pivot talk to bed if it hasn't already. Darryl goes on to say, this will continue to pressure your tire and any surprise above the expectation will only royal markets even more. Darryl went as enough enough. Six-day losing streak. We have now all the way back to late November 2020. I mean, just think about that. We've wiped out pretty much all of the post-vaccine gains. Got about that much left to do. We close yet. Not quite yet, John. We breached some pretty important technical levels yesterday on the S&P, around 3590, which puts 3500 squarely into play now and maybe even the pre-pandemic levels. The point, Kayleigh in Edwin making is a great one, which is we have a leadership problem here. Tech can't lead. And if history is any guide right now, what's happening is anytime you go into any kind of a major bear market, so I think the tech bear market of 2000, 2001, 2002, tech underperformed for five years following that. Think, 0809, when financials and banks led into the crisis, they never resumed leadership on the other side. So the question is, on the other side of this, can tech actually resumed leadership or not? The history doesn't play out well there terribly. So, Tower, if you're considering potentially a lost decade or a lost five years for a big chunk of this equity market, what does that mean for the strategy that's paid off so well over the last 10 years, which is just a hug, a market-capped benchmark, the S&P 500? Yeah, I think that's right, John. I mean, you've got to be much more selective here. You can't just buy the end-of-see. You can't just own the ETF and worry about market cap letting it carry the day for you. That you've got to look at high quality earnings. You've got to be defensive in this environment. And so it's really about how you play this. If you think about the margin pressure that lies before us, not behind us, it's going to be fairly extreme with the cost of inputs, labor, commodity prices. When PPI goes up at a faster rate than even what CPI does, and companies don't have pricing availability, that always historically has created margin pressure. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now. And I think we're going to hear in Q3 earnings, the recession talk is the highest level it's been from CEOs and management in a decade, basically. So I think the trouble still lies before us. The good news is bear markets are a function of price and time. We're getting there on price. We're not quite there yet. Time, I think, is a little more questionable. It takes bear markets often a year and a half, a year and three quarters to work the way through of history and a guide. We're not that far in yet, so we may have some more time yet to work our way through. And Darryl President, the Guards speaking right now in Washington. And I'll allow you to try and read between the lines here. She said central banks need to cooperate with each other. Central banks must understand spillovers and spillbacks. Is that a DIAJ? Here's my message for you. Love Christine. Yeah, well, I think she's right. Right? I mean, there are central banks. Everybody is tightening. We know that 90% of the global central banks are tightening. The reality is what's crazy about this environment is the episode.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2159,2022-10-12 13:40:26
13934," Everybody is tightening. We know that 90% of the global central banks are tightening. The reality is what's crazy about this environment is the epicenter seems to be in the developed markets. So obviously in the UK with the BOE, obviously in the JGB market with what's happening with the BOJ. And so that's where it gets concerning where you have you know dollar yen back at 147 this morning. You have guilt, 30 year guilt, almost at 5%. So I think Ligard is trying to take some of the fever out of the markets if you will and get them to settle down here, particularly as that UK pension rebalancing has to happen during now and Friday. I think we've got Mike McKee down in Washington. Good for us. I hope that we can bring him in if he's available if someone in the control room can tell me. Is he good? Mike McKee, morning Mike. Good morning John. We've been watching Christine Ligard this morning. She followed Harohika Corota, the governor of the bank of Japan, both of them making the case that central banks must continue with their policies. Obviously the Japanese are easing, but Christine Ligard and earlier the Dutch central banker Klaus not saying we need more, but they do need to be aware of the fact that everybody is raising rates except for the Japanese and that could have, as you just noted, spillover effects around the world. Mike, you just wondered if this is a first step towards convincing the Federal Reserve to back away. Mahamadale Rian said yesterday we have a global problem. It requires a global solution. How far away from a global solution are we? Well, I would say we're a long way at this point. It is a lot of central banks who are dealing with local individual mandates. They're supposed to take care of their own economies and they have to do that. You talk to U.S. Fed officials and they point out we know what's going on in the rest of the world, but by law we're responsible for raising interest rates essentially because we've got to bring inflation down under our legal mandate. Everybody's kind of in that vote. I have talked to several central bankers this morning who said they kind of feel sorry for Andrew Bailey and the position that he's in, but there isn't much that Bailey can do differently because it's either let inflation go, which is against their mandate or take a chance on the markets. So this point, he's taking a chance on the markets and that may be come the case for other central banks. We just don't know what's out there. They just can't find a way to centrally coordinate all this. I think what Lagarde was referring to this morning is we talk to each other. We know what each other are doing, but we're not actually working on a coordinated plan. Mike McKee, thank you, sir. We're going to pick up on this in just a couple of minutes time. Darryl Krunk, I just want to get a final word out to you if I can, sir. The approach for decades has been our currency, your problem. We're at that kind of tipping point close to it where it starts to become our problem too. It could obviously trade rate a dollar up 20%. I think what's happening right now is the Fed may be underestimating the strength of the dollar and the impact it's having around the globe around dollar shortage and tightening financial conditions. In essence, John, I think what we're saying is the US dollar is putting the world on a margin call right now. Darryl Krunk there on the latest. It's pretty worrying if that's the case, sir. I have to say, I'm going to pick up on that in just a moment. Up next, Intel planning thousands of job cuts, adding insult to chip makers injury. You kind of started hearing concerns and actually saw concerns about kind of this consumer led cyclical downturn within the semiconductor industry.

13935," is all we can on Bloomberg Television and Radio. You kind of started hearing concerns and actually saw concerns about kind of this consumer leds, cyclical downturn within the semiconductor industry. We've seen it across kind of specifically that the GC and smartphone markets where we think good potentially and likely will trickle into other and markets like auto and dust fields and data centers and there are signs of that in specific areas of semiconductors where that is taking place. The headwinds continue into pile up for the chip makers, Intel becoming the latest to fill the pain, planning thousands of job cards. Bloomberg reporting the layoffs will come this month as the company looks to lower cost amid weakening PC demand. Back with us for more. And ladle low. Hey, John. Sources saying that the focus of the cuts could be in sales and marketing where those departments get a reduction of around 20%. As you said on October 27th, Intel has its quarterly earnings report. There is an expectation that we might hear something about this. Then remember back in July, Pat Gelsinger, the CEO warned us that sales would be $11 billion lower than previously forecast. There's two things happening. The global slowdown for consumer electronics, Intel and main player in PC process. But also it's losing market share to rivals like AMD that have made quarters in recent games. This is a sector where analysts are clawing back on expectations going forward, given the change in markets and macro conditions. Really interesting data point though on the terminal this morning, Vanda out with a research note saying that retail investors have been piling into the chip sector, net purchases of $812 million of semis stocks over the last five days, including names like Intel. But this is the latest name in corporate America to respond to changing conditions with reduction in head count. Severe, but remember, Intel is a unique pain story. The broader cyclical story for chips is one that called us by surprise. And thank you, sir. Another sign of weakness, perhaps. The stock is down by about 2.10% of 1% in early trading. The broader story, you know, well now, self-dereconomic data, darker outlooks, clouding IMF meetings in DC. We called up with Mahamand El Arian looking back to 2008. They're going to be gloomy because there's also geopolitical risk on top of that. There's the whole challenge on climate. We mustn't forget that. So this is going to be a reminder a little bit of October 2008 when people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. I'm a key, Mohamed, not saying it's going to be 2008, just that it's really gloomy right now. I'm going to give you a little bit of how gloomy it was back then too. How gloomy is it from what you're sitting right? It's gloomy, but not in the way it was in 2008. I well remember that when there was a systemic problem when markets themselves were seizing up around the world. And that's not what's happening right now. Instead, it's inflation and it's growth. And that is something that the central banks have to deal with, but it's not going to bring down the entire financial system. At least that's the view here in Washington as central bankers gather from around the world. The British are in recession, according to the latest GDP data out this morning, the economy contracting the pound, obviously falling at the same time. The Japanese yen has been weakening tremendously as well, the intervention wearing off. Haruhika, the bank of Japan, governor, saying we're still looking at maybe doing that again, and of course Andrew Bailey giving his three day warning to people. But what you're seeing is a whole lot of central banks doing their own thing, attacking the problems in their own way. We're not going to see coordination from the central banks. They'll be cooperation, but they're going to remain tough on inflation. All of the central bankers I've talked to here say they are still focused on inflation. That's their mandate. They're going to keep doing that. The G7 G20 are meeting, but don't expect any kind of communicate that suggests that they will be working together as they did in 2009 and London when Gordon Brown got the IMF and World Bank attendees and the G20 together and got them to agree on some sort of coordinated plans to boost growth. Market turmoil may continue. Here says, as I mentioned, a little while ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2161,2022-10-12 13:51:41
13936," Market turmoil may continue. Everybody here says, as I mentioned a little while ago, there's some sympathy for Andrew Bailey, but the real question is going to be, do the markets trade? If the markets can trade, doesn't matter, the price, central banks will leave them alone. They've got to focus on inflation, and that is a point that was reinforced by this morning's PPI here in the United States, where we saw a core and headline inflation higher than anticipated coming into the month of October. And so we look forward to CPI tomorrow with a little bit of nervousness, but the central bank's central bankers here say they're going to stay on track. Physical policy makers as well, Mike, they're in focus too. President LeGuard said, physical policy must focus on the most vulnerable. Mike, back in the pandemic, we had the physical space to do a lot for a lot of people. We have much less space this time around. Do you get a sense that maybe we've got to recalibrate the fiscal effort to help those that are really in need and not trying to do too much because the space isn't there in the same it was to do more for many more people? That's absolutely right. There's no space in the United States to do something like that. Even if you agree we can print the money, there's no political will. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in Europe and what happens in the UK. It's a question of how do they finance it in Europe? Are they willing to do joint euro bonds? That's a line that the Germans haven't wanted to cross but maybe they'll be forced to do it. And then of course all the ruckians about what the UK government is going to do for the people. Cutting taxes or offering fiscal support will have to see how that plays out. Mike McKee, thank you, sir. Down in DC, Mike with us all week on top of this story. It's getting harder and harder to kind of write the policy response to all of this. CPI coming up tomorrow morning, the S&P 500 hired by two tenths of 1% or the Nasdaq up by a third with the sector price action is happy. Hey, John. And one question today, of course, will be whether or not the S&P 500 and these indexes can hang on to those gains to snap a multi-day losing streak as for sector-wise. More sectors are lower at this time but we do have some strength for consumer staples of 1.2% that's of course on that Pepsi B. We also have some breaking news right now that the FDA has a okayed Pfizer's Omicron booster eligibility for people five years and above. So Pfizer is popping higher right now. It's up about 2%. Moderna, that is true for that company and stock as well. It's popping even more up 12.7% also having to do with the Merck eligibility or development for cancer and RNA vaccine. And then as for the down sectors, energy is down and we also have some of those rate sensitive sectors down, energy down with oil, real estate and utilities, not as attractive with the yields. Higher, now we've been talking about the possibility of this double bear market for the NASDAQ 100 regardless of how you see it because again the index is down almost 40% on the year that's steady downtrend. We have these indexes. It's incredible in the last two months. This is that double bear market S&P 500 tech index down 22%. The socks, the chips down 27%. You can see some real weakness here, John. This of course as yields have gone higher, pressuring valuation, of course, demand chips, so many different factors, overall very bearish for tech. That's who month's screen is absolutely brutal. Ugly, Abby, thank you. Looking at the guilt market right now, 10 year guilt yields up by 14 basis points to 457 on a 30 year guilt up. Guilt yields are up by 24 basis points back through 5%. That's for the diary the next couple of days. We've got CPI tomorrow morning in America, end of the week we've got bank earnings from JP Morgan and company. And then for the UK, that guilt market operation set to end at the end of the week. End of the month, we get the fiscal announcement, stand on November and November 3rd. We get a bank-eventment rate decision as well. What a two, three weeks we have lined up for you up next year's training diary from New York.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake's Bloomberg Rear. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year, and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. America in culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Look for the winning number in size high for a 7-day off-on TV and your paper. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. A million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2164,2022-10-12 14:04:26
13939," It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employers winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant but it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a monitor of cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband Raul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition and Raul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed and he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks and when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2165,2022-10-12 14:08:45
13940," Police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour, I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country but at the same time they yearned for independence, they wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over $400 million to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them, pro bono. I learned that they used to build up their homes at Pepsi and for people who might be in the field. So he had money for their own families, even the rest. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for a confide and another heating for the branch one for 138 also three times a month. Also there was a time my father was hospital, Juru, to heart failure. Still he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to the next one of the father. My father passed away on what it was 1320 then after staying for almost one year in the hospital he died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2166,2022-10-12 14:13:01
13941," When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped, they were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty. In Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. The news was coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as a coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echoed far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered the attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all matchdays the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices, they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2167,2022-10-12 14:17:24
13942," The series for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well, Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th, 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Matchdays are always special in Dortmund, everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for matchday was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in a pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with, he called me and said, turn on the TV, there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, it was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. It would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right Wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. They would buy that one by a head of a match and then three bombs go off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2168,2022-10-12 14:21:50
13943," of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something, something, something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund footballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene, claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on its way to work and his name was Saget Bena Gott. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borziot Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Saga Venigold, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. The intergold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped.

13944," Becca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small, it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past 1000 years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there, and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. We are trying to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence that's safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environment, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Elevi and made a living.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2170,2022-10-12 14:30:18
13945," In the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, 1km wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority of more than 90% of all the really large 1km near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000 something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's as many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth and then Cmon had B.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2171,2022-10-12 14:34:57
13946," is small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly there. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forwards in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they, if you go forward in time, would follow on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today, and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare these all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI, can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then it's where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead at an asteroid until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available you can simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. So it's kind of like bowling if you will. If you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and then letting a pressure of light or perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that survey the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2172,2022-10-12 14:39:22
13947," better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem with the global common sense. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with those seconds notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he walks a small satellite around the earth that are always going and looking out where I mean I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence of stake, right. It'll be good. The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Homemade sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my letsis in. I'm going to be posting stocks that will boom. They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Let's just lock it on up and take 50 dollars a dollar. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over three million dollars. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue the head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This isn't a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok vincluentzers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and Baijubat in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2173,2022-10-12 14:43:52
13948," Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. They realized that there was a gap in the market and that the market brings in the markets they could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond 5 or 6 or 7 dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people on to this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting, had been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood, even today with all of its popularity. The median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs and the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a $1,000 account. They're just a headache. I want a $100,000 account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remaining doors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products, come along with them. Robinhood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robinhood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robinhood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robinhood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones and between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2174,2022-10-12 14:47:45
13949," With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. It's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's risk taking that's dumb. But if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle, sure you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives for needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other, it's been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency, historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021, that's being done on the internet. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders affect the two larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The Personal Finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you guys understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluentcers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big, behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about. And it's gait kept behind industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills, tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I've been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that's the more that we can have people thinking you brought finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society. I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is a tax-coping price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at a press? And a ton of women just like attack that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2175,2022-10-12 14:52:15
13950," fun of women. Just like, attack that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, the, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a l g o word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you touch some of the tension in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life, nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around. And where people are sticking around reddit and it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but reddit is like the social media platform for finance places like Wall Street bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street bets adopted a 4chan like etiquette leading to their tagline like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for why stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day and you would look at Wall Street bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of squared the circle so to speak and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat to live, but there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yo low their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail, brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home, looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stock Twist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial wellbeing and make very good decisions. And I think Warren Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall. And it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2176,2022-10-12 14:56:35
13951," What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back and the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody! Rory and Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. Instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls in the institution. Art is powerful, it's maybe the institution's left them to be eaten. And they're not pumping up GameStop with the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on mean stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's mean stocks like GameStop, mean coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2177,2022-10-12 15:00:54
13952," Ten, maybe fifteen years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it. It's such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been ripped. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Someone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. And I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service.

13953," net at home. But in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between 80 and 150 dollars for about 25 megabits per second. However gigabit service which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical is running at about 119 a month or 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years he's been trying to bring a nifortable fiber optic network to talent. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country civic boosters have been going to extremes chanting. Singing and marching trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world to be a part of the world and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013 we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020 the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites they've said, hey we know you're all staying home but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth and I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available we had it really considered that in our purchasing of the house whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home we didn't have the option to do that at our house so every day when school would start we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case there were also racial and socio-economic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference low-income African-American students, Latino students and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns there's also a lack of competition forcing internet prices up and large providers like AT&T and Comcast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how extremity makes life simple easy awesome. So in our area we have a small imprint of Comcast but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2179,2022-10-12 15:09:35
13954," to the more rural areas, it's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance, to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement, encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March, and signed by President Donald Trump, awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least, as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home, and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now, they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas..... Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change, not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, you know, source of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2180,2022-10-12 15:13:44
13955," It is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, a source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teach erasios. But Dr. Pravine Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana Social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Talk to the parents, talk to the teachers, talk to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. What kind of challenges the parents have? One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. Hey, how are you? I seem to find you and have a good view and find a better law. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past, I am not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero, I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2181,2022-10-12 15:18:08
13956," So, these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about 6 doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Svaroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college, in this country. But today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, in Pujita, Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I am so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world, on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. The lot of extracurricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many in coaching academy, we have boxing academy, we have Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy. So, we have, you know, Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced goldfalls, like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in goldfinals schools. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, you know, type of opportunities to the students. So, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally, because poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one world. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. Their stereotypes talk to Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University, and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. The university is like, in those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for shelter to drive. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then try to excel in academics day in and day.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2182,2022-10-12 15:22:27
13957," were exclusively meant for shoulder cause and shoulder tribes. We used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again, you know, try to excel in academics day in and day out. So that's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really, you know, place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future, this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. When Singapore close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the city structures only make it worse. That is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. Even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant for cool water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel in Casino Complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2183,2022-10-12 15:26:46
13958," from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators, for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and as the importance of vegetation, that's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban heat island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why Cooling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your heat island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2184,2022-10-12 15:31:10
13959," A limited option, but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. The will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next. And the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others, seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money. And then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2185,2022-10-12 15:35:27

How did the YouTube channel come to be when the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3ds There was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people and At the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and That video got six views and then two days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I Just started pumping out more and more content and people were like this guy knows what he's talking about It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like My channel really focuses on tips and tricks so I Play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark And then I'll make my first video while I'm going through I've a giant no pad and just Skribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me So I know the things that may stump other people What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel one? You need to do something that you're passionate about Not that you like now that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about This other thing is something that other people are passionate about it holds a special place to them And third is it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on In order to enter into the marketplace you either need to be better than everyone else You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else and You can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works Which is very similar to Google Analytics then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a youtuber kind of breaks down to three different ways one which is the bulk of it which is ad revenue Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner and then you go on to the next video or non-skippable ad or The video starts immediately you get the little banner at the bottom or If you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video and all of them pay the certain amount It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it The time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a Reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 Companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every 1,000 views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views. I made 30 cents But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content Some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars And there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February That's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos In that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then instead? You're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher The second way that a YouTuber makes income is Support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off Patreon was really the only option But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get Special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2186,2022-10-12 15:39:58
13961," constex to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then on auto mod banzio. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it you're not doing it for other people you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it. Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. Of course you have to be on Twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used to do in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand they're either very, very good or funny. There's no fairs, mad, whatever it is on that side. It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald's straight to VHS movies. Remember those? I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game I would ram along about movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. So I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right. Now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience I think stay with you, you have to bring something extra. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. You got to make it a little more exciting. All right. Throwing a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great. You're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like, it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2187,2022-10-12 15:44:15

And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while, and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the, like, profitable point of it. And... there you have it! My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So, don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Thea and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about, you know, only shopping. It's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So, it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing. And China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtue currency and gifts. In the West, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. And China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search-of-information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform. And as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice. Nice, neutral, beautiful print, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates, and they call this number or something. But live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference. They call this different psychology. And live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2188,2022-10-12 15:48:28
13963," When you shop, actually, this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba? Added a live streaming function in early 2016. In following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. When you shop, you can also shop on the platform. You can also shop on the platform. It's a very high-end product and technology caclid. Whether it's our user or the company's top-down-to-earth-hand, it's very high. Over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold via live stream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people dispense that I'm actually interacting with you. And a live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy in order to sense the sense of a music control especially during pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers, which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming via she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of the platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipsticks, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rocked a launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. And then we really have to go on a business trip. The king was Li Jiaqi. I widely known as lipstick brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that we will actually put the lipstick on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking live streamers like Tiffany still earn a good income through sales commissions. If I say that from the beginning of the show, the main streamer's work is much higher than the main streamer's. But the main streamer's work is very much more experienced and has a lot of experience. Every day, when you need to work hard, you need to work hard for 5-6 hours. And if you work for 5-6 hours, your brain is not working. Your mouth is not working. Your hands are not working. Your eyes are not working. Like we did before, we didn't just do single-legged live streamers. And we still have some work to do with the product. And we still have some other things to do with the product. Actually, there's no other people living. I think the main streamer's influence is not about the whole thing. Maybe if you do something new, you will get a lot of impact. And it's about the content that you don't want to share. The content that you don't want to share is about your understanding and your trust. If you don't have a horse, you will get a horse. If you don't like horse, you will get a horse.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2189,2022-10-12 15:52:55
13964," I'm not sure if I can understand you. I'm very grateful to you. I don't have a horse. I don't have a horse. If you don't like it, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what a product does, what a product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy and they need to show in some ways that they're authentic. For VIA and Li Chasi, they're able to articulate that quite a bit through the body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chasi will always say bad things about certain products. To him, there's this honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. They seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. Don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Chasi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in 30 seconds. If you're able to create a lot of bass, you can just think things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. From there, you might get hope to continue to eat bad news and show to the community. Live streamers also use sound techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something because social proof has taken over meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in. Other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers. Local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governments in like small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers. And it enables a lot of players to actually sell. The live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function. Adding interactive features like chat rooms. Companies including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, the market has actually started to become a topic. The future development space and potential are all huge. Next, we will be more and more united in a way. It will become a more daily conversation. It's a more complex conversation. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the chassis numbers are weird. You know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2190,2022-10-12 15:57:22
13965," You can imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We're storing huge amounts of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind, and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to a commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady a pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project, so sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Palaamist Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, the Rano Coivissari observed a strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate and that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the force that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel. With both devices and devices, Windows 85, MI,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2191,2022-10-12 16:01:43
13966," Wave roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It submotes in the depth of 15 meters so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The wave roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller. Aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile Israeli company EcoWave Power is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder in a braver man developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded causing the largest in history nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to offer a cessitation which saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy although it's an immense source of electricity the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success and there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011 the then 24-year-old inner co-founded eco-wave power. Instead of installing devices offshore the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient especially in comparison to the offshore technologies because we don't need any ships, divers under water mooring or cables when Stalin-existent man-made structures and all our expensive equipment the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation is located on land just like a regular power station. This is the eco-wave power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built the higher the waves the higher the pressure which is used to turn the hydro motor which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system which you can see right here and in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2192,2022-10-12 16:05:45
13967," The hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations, like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-dink commissioning rigs or for powering and water autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to throw money at all. Please wait. I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale. Do you think you know what I'm going to say? I mean, you're eating so much.

13968," I mean, you're eating corrods, you're not going to miss the season. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Pazzi's home being raided by court officials in Yokohana. You scared me, I scared my children, I love these and you're 16 years old. So Ra Pazzi's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlosco and he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlosco and he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Pazzi, I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motocco Limited. You could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlosco saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero and now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by non-Japanese executive. Well Carlosco was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlosco. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays and one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2194,2022-10-12 16:14:26
13969," So after Carlos Gón was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gón, and he was told, get to the heart of the matter, find out what Carlos Gón did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinada and his role in Carlos Gón's downfall. Harinada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do you miss the Heidi? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gón and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gón, as his final legacy play, was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gón. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gón had to go. Harinada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long-standing relationship with him or did have a long-standing relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harinada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right. It just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harinada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gón. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. People, Chairman's been arrested, a representative director's been arrested. They both happened to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. It's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2195,2022-10-12 16:18:55
13970," The instructor to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers. They're called lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take. And you do think, yes, how was this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Passey makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, in great detail, backed up by evidence, backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately, for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the going executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at the global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and the harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2196,2022-10-12 16:23:03
13971," Eventually he'd lost the coveted General Counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rob and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. And during that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was a round mid-march, and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed, either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling. I was very concerned as to what they were doing, and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people? Where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama. To basically do a search of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court, and they're here to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone, whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again, I just couldn't understand or what is the point of doing that. You know, this isn't a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well, and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2197,2022-10-12 16:27:31
13972," I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. Yeah. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it seemed to sort of rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Chottenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chottenstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chottenstein kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW Shoes. Beverly's husband died.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2198,2022-10-12 16:31:47
13973," kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences. It was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local Chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements and she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page and it was there. She saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not theorize or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know Dawn, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. We're on the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. The FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly's signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million dollars over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called you know JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Abby and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading. The checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box and that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this you know five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone but why it happened. They're ve-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2199,2022-10-12 16:36:19
13974," First, they're such an evolving narrative about why the joy was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity, honor account and ended up setting off a fire storm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs, they're there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bob, you're kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now and he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. She took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars, as well as all her stock and big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating. Millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank, yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandsons, as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter. Said his son's worn criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonative with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2200,2022-10-12 16:40:38
13975," She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. She did wrong. On April 20th oil markets did something they never had. They crashed into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus $38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear several rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. And a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits. And in 2005 the IPU closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions but Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and there he's drinking buddies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2201,2022-10-12 16:44:50
13976," Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties, and they're, you know, drinking buddies, some. Or they're his own kids, friends from football. You know, their young lads, hungry and ambitious, and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly, he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders. They're independent, let's be clear, but they're all part of his collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into it. Sweet, as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a sort of guy which he's style accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But, you know, these guys, they drove around, very nice rolls, noises and bentonies. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Thaden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live. And it's 20 minutes to Chewie Bride away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London, and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, he's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, or you're Glen Cores, but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious. And at first, we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together. They would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that, you know, this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader, there's a number of different ways you can trade. And probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says, I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future. Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex, there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets. And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230 p.m. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well. And whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130 p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers. You know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2202,2022-10-12 16:49:30
13977," and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trader you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making a hundred million dollars in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a zero sum game. Every time you're making money as an oil trade or someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada. They sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, then if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega capital-aul's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made in the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set. They were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know oil majors BP and Shell and here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day and we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group and the law firm was at pains to point out number one they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing that they all traded independently and separately and they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2203,2022-10-12 16:53:43
13978," and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion. And some people will look at what happened and think, that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against a vega or anyone affiliated with it, might be you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And, you know, in most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community. They'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2204,2022-10-12 16:57:53
13979," One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler, and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions? Then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions, and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Deciding. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost-effective. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zero in out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues, and they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. Companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. It definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here are 20 NERI's, and it's the Disney World this year! If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2205,2022-10-12 17:02:18
13980," So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges and that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly this land, 3,000 of these acres was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they they've done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive which they've had for decades to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney that didn't want to be interviewed for this story. But they all pulled us that look we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange is called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent you have policymakers but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the incentive to really participate hard make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2206,2022-10-12 17:06:37
13981," are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is, is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low-cost offsets, and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system, and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom, and that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. It's a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from L.A. to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2207,2022-10-12 17:10:45
13982," to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that our last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Lucia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents, or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology, is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2208,2022-10-12 17:15:24
13983," Investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology. There's no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. You know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more knows than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. In visioning the ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve, those fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev, and 1,000 kmh hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2209,2022-10-12 17:19:34
13984," Manchester is a five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in the year of first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is divergied from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end, we'll make it possible to travel, for example, over over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end the usefulness of the real network, because the moment that you can see the first, from any engine, and there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2210,2022-10-12 17:24:30
13985," tool element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network because the moment that a track is switching that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it so you need a lot of space between trains. In a high point because you have no moving components in the track all the vehicles can be much closer to each other you can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube because the test track is only 30 meters long. They haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have and we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lab conditions so we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects we're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that do need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies ran Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hearts Next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop Sur...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2211,2022-10-12 17:28:15
13986," route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently, the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a six-mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperloop companies, I think, is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details, and I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets, and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes.

Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Snam, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years, as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. No-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War 2 Hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Snam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Interestingly, Edwards explains. Hydrogen. The most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries in heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing, and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2213,2022-10-12 17:37:02
13988," Policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H.T. demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Francing Laqua caught up with Twiggy Forrest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And, you know, anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agri, just looking there and saying, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. Did I got to it two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB and Fortescue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything's super well from Fortescue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom, right? Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on, greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of possible fuel, possible fuel, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in this project. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrism. Yeah. So look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more qualified power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and greenhagen, it's completely the plan of the planet. You know, hydrism to not make renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenwashing. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for ESG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen, that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at a multi-billion dollar scale. If they're not that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra seriously, that greenhagen is never here to stay, it's broken through, the history has been made, it will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today that and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now?

13989," Never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidizing, you stop using money into possibly. Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed. While we ask the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that maneuver because we haven't had that green option, it's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also some excuses, oh never be commercial, never be supplied into quantities we needed. Now, blah, blah, now we know it. Let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to beat? Yeah, it's a fantastic person, 8 to b's the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon is being done honestly. We encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. It's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more cheaper. But it's the only fuel you know. Mr. Froskin. It's declining in value. You don't have enough of it, right, to power the world. Yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Yeah. Now, we've got five or ten years to make huge difference. And it policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now, okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book.

13990," Translated by from Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York. I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Armeria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Coss are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence at times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $1,600. Today, a hundred, and we see it going down to 50 and five years' time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen. The cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is the future we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 a kilo, which is $25.00 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically is to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, you know, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and we say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the decade. And in big scale. In big scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2216,2022-10-12 17:50:11
13991," And then, depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the decade. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at 0 deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get to 50% of renewables. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit, and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there, and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, yes, the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP, and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years. How quick, it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years, or could otherwise happen in 15-20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects, and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam, there, speaking with our Maria Tadeo. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel, made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space, on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In the long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton. And that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line. We'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2217,2022-10-12 17:54:26
13992," From my own samsut From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lyons, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N-E-F Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day though, how much is this going to cost? Well that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to date yet. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTU's for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be changed anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2218,2022-10-12 17:58:40
13993," energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it made different in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah, so for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series.

I'm Kayleigh Lines from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. And this is Bloomberg Green. The Bloomberg Business Out. And at Bloomberg Quick Take. This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World headquarters, I'm Charlie Pellet the Dow holding onto a 50 point gain up by just about 0.2%. We have got the S&P 500 index just turning higher now up by three points, net is tank up by 11 for the net is tank composite index. That is again right now of just about six points. We are getting the latest FOMC minutes and many policy makers saw the cost of two little outweighing the cost of too much. That officials favored reaching restrictive rates in the near term. One additional headline from the FOMC minutes. Several Fed members saw the need to calibrate Fed tightening to mitigate risk. So those headlines crossing the Bloomberg professional service right now. Of course we will have more details as they become available. Right now we have got the S&P pairing gains down four points dropped there of one tenth of one percent. And a state shamero so is chief investment officer at iCapital. She says also weighing on markets is what's happening in the United Kingdom. Well, I think it's a big warning sign and it's a red flag and we should not just assume just because we're not in the United States. We're immune from it. I mean",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2219,2022-10-12 18:02:59
13994," what's happening in the United Kingdom? Well, I think it's a big warning sign and it's a red flag and we should not just assume just because we're not in the United States, we're immune from it. I mean, if you think about what's happened over the last 14 years, you had virtually zero interest rates around the world. And that means that certain leverage accumulated certain places. And it's not in the corporate side per se. It's not in the consumer side per se, but it leverage has accumulated on the government balance sheets. And again, more details from the FOMC Minutes, policymakers quote, reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the feds, 2% goal, many officials stressing the need to stay the course even as the labor market slows. S&P, off the point, a little change that out of 74, up 3.10s, we've gotten has to stack up six points. As we get those FOMC Minutes, the 10-year yield 3.91% of the two-year, 4.29%, spot-gold, up 4.10s of 1%, 1672, the ounce West Texas, intermediate crude, down 2.3%. I'm Charlie Palatette. There's a Bloomberg Business Flash. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Inside from the reporters and editors who bring you America's most trusted business magazine, plus global business, finance, and tech news, as it happens. Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. And a very good afternoon, everybody. Live from the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio, streaming on YouTube, it is a fed Wednesday. She just heard from Charlie Palat. We did have those fed minutes just crossing. And really, what is key is fed officials committed to raising interest rates to a restrictive level in the near-term and holding them there to get inflation back to their target. Those several said it would be important to calibrate the pace of rate hikes to mitigate adverse risks to the economy, which is something that we've heard from a lot of fed speakers in the last couple of weeks. Yeah, the minutes also offering no new details on the size of likely rate moves at the November FOMC meeting or future gatherings, but traders have really priced in 75 basis points. We're going to have much more on these fed minutes. Molly Smith is diving into him right now, and she's going to join us in just a few minutes. I do want to point out though, we are seeing yields take a hair lower, and we are seeing the equity markets firm a little bit in terms of initial reaction. I mean, the DAW was up just about 34 points just prior to the release. It's up 92. S&P was down a few points now. It's up a few points, and the Nasdaq was down about eight. It's now up about 14. So a little bit of firming on the equity side of things. Now with this as our backdrop, we are going to tell you why James Bullard is Wall Street's go-to guy for a hit of that fed pivot. The story involves a bicycle, so I really love it. Tips are down. Well, for Intel workers, Carol, we get details on that. Yeah, also why the future for Twitter looks bumpy, even if Elon Musk still goes through. And then we're going to talk about airlines rallying and so is PepsiCo. Also stopping by the co-founder and CEO of Improbable, it's a soft bank backed company aiming to be a player when it comes to the metaverse.

Let's set the business week agenda on this Fed Wednesday, FOMC Wednesday maybe. I should say pretty good. Anchor and Market's correspondent Bloomberg, she's an interactive broker studio. So too is Molly Smith, economics editor at Bloomberg News, who has been pouring over those Fed minutes, and I do want to start with you. What's key here? So I think this really just reinforces a lot of the message of what we've heard from Fed officials in the past couple of weeks since the September policy meeting that rates need to stay high. They're going higher and they're going to stay there for quite a while. And that I'm honestly a bit surprised on seeing the market reaction as relatively muted as it is. That this would seem to me. I've kind of gotten back to where it was prior to the minutes now. Right. I mean, not that I don't know that anybody really needed for the reinforcement that the pivot isn't coming, but this would be it. It's interesting that you say that. I mean, stocks searching for direction a much of the day, moving between gains and losses. We're seeing that certainly play out as investors make their way through these minutes. Credit good, do you have a chance to watch the trading action over the last five minutes? What are you noticing? Well, or lack thereof, right? There hasn't really been any. And I think that's crucial to what Molly was saying. But what I will also say is that the key here is that the message is still the same. They are still hiking. They do see the issues. Even the wage price spiral rate. It's not like there's a food fight over like, don't do this. Do this. And look, the things that they marked as risks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2220,2022-10-12 18:07:41
13995," need four speed to peak rates. Are we starting to see any kind of division in terms of the camps? It's hard to say if there's a clear cut line there, but I think that you're starting to hear more of the yes we're charging ahead, but we know that we're gonna have to slow down. That that, so far it's been a lot of the messaging we need to charge ahead, and that's all we're thinking of. And almost like tunnel vision on hiking rates up to restrictive territories. So there is at least recognition that financial conditions are tightening, that there are risks to the outlook, and they are attuned to those risks. And I gotta say, we're not saying much in terms of changes in yields, that's for sure, but we are still continuing to see some support in the equity market. It's small, but nonetheless, there's a little bit more enthusiasm when it comes to that trade. I'm gonna be big thank you to both of you, Kreeti Gupta, Anchor and Market's correspondent for Bloomberg. Molly Smith, economics editor for Bloomberg News, both with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio in New York. To world and national news, we go into Washington, DC with Nancy Lyons. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tam. There's no let up to Russia's bombardment in Ukraine with missile attacks reportedly causing a crippled nuclear plant to lose all external power for the second time in five days. It's prompting NATO defense ministers to consider sending more advanced weapons to Ukraine. All of this demonstrates the urgent need for more air defense for Ukraine. That's NATO Secretary General again, Stoltenberg, who says they need to send short range and long range air defense systems that can take on ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. President Biden finds himself walking a tightrope over the world's demand for oil and gas. In September, the Biden administration asked industry leaders to boost domestic stockpiles and send less American made fuel overseas. They did not. Well, now the White House is looking at whether to restrict gasoline and diesel exports, but it's tricky because the US is facing calls from allies to help ease Europe's energy crisis. But it's also under pressure to help Americans with the rising cost of fuel at home. It is a major political risk only weeks before the November midterms in Washington. I'm Amy Moore, it's Bloomberg Radio tomorrow. The House Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol will hold what's believed to be its final hearing.

Stocks just a little bit higher up, about two tenths of a percent. But it's playing tough, isn't it? Just like Starbucks is playing tough. Check this out. So Apple withholding its latest employee benefits from staff who work at its sole unionized retail store. This is a move that could potentially inflame labor tensions at the technology giant. You could say that again. Oh my gosh. So the company told retail and corporate staff just this week that it will increase benefits for outside educational classes and health care, according to people familiar with the matter. Workers will get more funds to pursue coursework and employees in some states will be able to access new health plan benefits of those who has not to be identified because the program hasn't been announced publicly. So basically rewarding those workers who haven't unionized. Right, but there are many of those workers. There's only one store at this point that has. So that's a big picture. That's a big thing to hear about. So penalizing everybody who's at the unionized store. It's pretty remarkable here. I mean, you have to also think about this in the context of the labor movement that's happening across the country right now. It's not just Apple. It's companies like Starbucks. It's just so blatant. It is. It absolutely is. But we heard something similar from Starbucks recently too. Exactly. Exactly. This is all from the playbook of how companies can work to prevent people from unionizing. Well, and what's interesting is, who's like I guess Apple announced it, they just said, OK, those of you in the unionized store, you're not going to get the perks. The reason given was that the Toaston store needs to negotiate benefits with Apple via the collective bargaining arrangement that comes with the union. Did I say that right, Toaston? Towson. Yeah, the store in Maryland is represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union. It's for her to begin formal negotiations with Apple. It's a labor group in recent days, which has been supplied employees with guides.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2221,2022-10-12 18:16:41
13996," So, when in Maryland is represented by the International Association of Machines and Aerospace Workers Union, it's for her to begin formal negotiations with Apple. It's a labor group in recent days supplied employees with guides to negotiate with Apple and hold conversations with managers. They're saying you're unionized workers, so there's a protocol, right? We've got to talk about the labor agreement and we have to do negotiating. I just want to touch on Starbucks. In the Starbucks case, the union said it was it had waived the right to negotiate over receiving perks that were already being provided to other stores, meaning employees, just get them automatically. It's getting complicated, as we said, Apple shares just a little bit higher. We're going to talk more about it with Mark German, who broke this story or put it out.

13998," We need another round of quantitative easing or asset purchases to help stimulate the economy. And that was well before the committee ended up adopting that policy. I see. One thing that I find really interesting about this is that he doesn't necessarily subscribe to the idea that unemployment has to go up for inflation to fall. Where does he see the way that inflation comes down? If it's not more people out of work or the unemployment rate going up, what is it? Yeah. That is exactly right. And that's interesting because, you know, that was one of the things in the FOMC minutes today is that the committee is saying that the unemployment rate may go up and that may be needed to to to to do us inflation. And his view is that there's really not much of a relationship if any between unemployment and inflation and that, you know, what affects inflation is inflation expectations and price setting by businesses. So when businesses get the fear of God that they're going to lose business because consumers won't abide by their price increases. They'll switch to something else or they'll switch to a competitor. Then that forces them not to raise prices and that that's the mechanism that that causes inflation. I feel like it's economics 101, you know, right? Like we talk about these dynamics, especially when it comes to pricing. I love your story. You give us some insight as to who Bullard is and you talk about how he has earned a reputation as something of a maverick. What is it about his background, his studies that maybe makes him think a little bit differently? Well, he grew up in Minnesota. He's, you know, you have so many of the Fed leaders including some of their super respected who went to MIT or Harvard. I mean, Ben Bernanke and so forth. But Bullard grew up in Minnesota in a small town. He played basketball and he was interested when he was in the 70s and what he was seeing with inflation. And he recalled how he went to college at St. Cloud State University and there was a poster on the wall explaining all the causes of inflation and like one theory was it was labor unions and another was it was government spending and there were one or two others. And like the one theory that was not up there was the Fed causes inflation and that was kind of become conventional wisdom after a vulcar finally raised rights and slayed the inflation dragon as he put it. Hey Steve, before we let you go again, it's just a great profile and encourage everybody to read it. What can you offer from your profile to investors right now trying to make sense of the Fed's path moving forward? What did Bullard say about that? What Bullard said is that, you know, I was kind of pressing him on what would cause you to pivot, what would cause you to change your tune. And he said basically right now it's too early to be even thinking about that. That, you know, you have a two-sided mandate and one hand inflation is 8% on the other hand unemployment is at 3.5%. Their mandate is full employment and price stability. So it's like there's really no argument right now. Yeah. Like until that dynamic changes, you're not going to see the Fed change. People stop talking about pivot. Come on. Just kidding, just kidding. Steve Matthews, great story. Economics reporter up Bloomberg News from Ardlan to Bureau.

Merck shares down 5 tenths of 1% Moderna based in Cambridge, Massachusetts up by 7.8%. Recapping 10 year yield 3.90%, S&P up by 3 tenths of 1% in tell up 1.6%. And that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well, you know all this week we've been talking a lot about the semiconductor area really for the last few weeks, some concerns about the outlook. And this story certainly plays into it. We got this last night, a Bloomberg exclusive, Intel shares. Certainly I think they were a little bit higher, actually. And this is on the news that the chip giant is planning thousands of job cuts to cut costs and cope with a PC slump. We're talking some serious job cuts to you. This exclusive byro and Mark Gurman and Debbie Wu. We got Mark Gurman on the line right now. He's technology reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us from our Los Angeles Bureau. And if you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see him there as well. So Mark, give us the details here. Because as I mentioned, we're talking serious job cuts potentially affecting about 20% of staff. What's going on?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2226,2022-10-12 18:38:32
14001," and YouTube, you'll be able to see him there as well. So Mark, give us the details here because as I mentioned, we're talking serious job cuts, potentially affecting about 20% of staff. What's going on? Yeah, so if you are an Intel employee, this is bad news. If you are an Intel shareholder or a slash investor, this is potentially good news, as Chrome mentioned. The stock is up a little bit today. So there has been some benefit from this news there. These are going to be major cuts. I'm told that this is likely to be the largest layoff to hit Intel since 2016. At that point, they laid off under former CEO, Brian Prasantich, about 11% of the company or 12,000 employees across the entire corporation globally. This is probably not going to be as big as that, but it is going to be something that requires some sort of major restructuring. I'm told the employee count is going to be in the thousands. Let's just face it, the PC market over the last couple quarters has slowed dramatically. Some of the PC makers, shipment totals, have dropped 30 to 40%. You look at Lenovo, you look at HP, you look at some of the other PC makers that use Intel processors, you're seeing a drop off there. So clearly, Intel's bread and butter, that's slowing down. At the same time, their profits are also shrinking. So it's not a good situation for Intel right now. They're reporting earnings on October 27th. That's their third quarter earnings. We are anticipating about a 20% year over year decline. The profit is down 15 basis points right from their usual measure. So they have to do these layoffs to really try to up their profit, up their gross margins. And that's why you're seeing the positive reaction from the stock. But obviously we're talking about human beings here. We're talking about employees. This is not going to be a positive site. This is going to be one of the bigger layoffs in the chip sector. Two companies that compete with Intel, Micron, and Nvidia recently said they wouldn't be doing layoffs, but ARM, right, a key technology competitor to Intel, an Oracle who competes with Intel on the server side, the data center side. They have seen some cuts recently. Mark, awkward as you point out in your story, this is an awkward moment for Intel because they lobbied so much for that $52 billion chips stimulus bill this year. And they talked about expanding chip manufacturing, semi manufacturing here in the United States in particular. So not a good look. Not a good look, but a lot of the damage is already done, right? They need because they clearly have to cut their costs. They need to do something. And unfortunately, it looks a lot like that's going to come on the human side, right? With those thousands of cuts to employees. We're actually told that a lot of the cuts are going to come in their sales and marketing group. And that's typically where you see cuts happen, initially in these types of circumstances, right? Marketing and sales. That's one group. It's called SMG at Intel. It's one mixed part of the organization. We're told cuts there could come as high as 20% of that division, right? But in terms of the general cut, company why that number will be less than 20% overall. But sales and marketing, you're going to see a big hit there, unfortunately. Hey, Mark, we got about a minute and a half left with you. And I wanted to touch on among your later stories, this one about Apple. We talked, Carolyn, I talked about this a little earlier. The company's planning to withhold its latest employee perks from its unionized store. What can you tell us about what's happening there? And put it in the context of the types of benefits that Apple does provide its employees. So for 2023, three new benefits. One, tuition reimbursement is now going to be tuition prepay for some colleges. So Apple will pay in advance so they don't have to reimburse you at the end of the semester. Coursera, normally $400 a year for a subscriber online. That's going to be a free subscription now for Apple employees. And then the health care plan through United Health, that's going to get some improvements, waived co-pays for select doctors. In regions like New York, New Jersey, Washington State, Connecticut, and a couple other states, those perks not coming to Maryland, right? In terms of the Towson Storm Maryland. That's Apple's sole unionized store. So they're going to have to negotiate if they want to get those into their collective bargaining agreement. This is interesting timing. What's happening tomorrow? Well, voting will now begin for a second potentially unionized store. This one in Oklahoma City. We'll see if this news has any impact there shortly. It's like another volley, the back and forth with this issue. Mark Gurman, great reporting, as we mentioned, that Intel's story of Bloomberg exclusive by Mark Mark is technology reporter, App Bloomberg News, joining us on the phone from our LA Bureau. And just to remind everybody, is Mark pointed out to that Intel shares up about 1.6%. As I said, Nucka News for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2227,2022-10-12 18:42:52
14002," order at Bloomberg News joining us on the phone from our LA Bureau and just to remind everybody's mark pointed out to that Intel shares up about 1.6 percent as he said. Not good news for several a bunch in fact Intel workers but investors certainly liking the news at their account. Yes so much to this story what's happening the PC market around the world and then of course also the chips act here in the US. Hey let's get on over to World of National News where Nancy Lyon is standing by and 99 one newsroom in Washington DC. Hey Nancy. Thanks Tim. Democratic senators are pushing for the US to temporarily pause arms sales to Saudi Arabia after OPEC plus moved to slash oil production by 2 million barrels a day. Experts say that could send gas prices higher around the world. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says the Saudis don't deserve our help. We are selling highly sensitive advanced technology to a country that has aligned itself with an adversary Russia that is committing terrorist war crimes. Blumenthal says the Saudis need to restore trust with the US. President Biden is in Colorado this afternoon where he's designating Camp Hale as his administration's first national monument. It was an Alpine training site where US soldiers prepared for battles in the Italian Alps during World War II. Many troops who trained at Camp Hale returned to Colorado after the war and helped create the state's lucrative ski industry. The House January 6th committee is getting ready for what may be its final public hearing tomorrow as we hear from Bloomberg's Nathan Hager. The panel is expected to focus on repeated warnings former president Donald Trump received about the threat of violence ahead of the attack on the Capitol. Sources tell the Washington Post the committee will present new video footage and internal secret service emails that may corroborate parts of former White House aid Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony. He told the committee in June that the former president was told some of his supporters were armed and that he clashed with secret service agents who insisted he'd stay away from the march to the Capitol. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick date powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. Alright, now thank you so much Nancy Lyons in our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. So we're just talking with our Mark Irman about what's going on with Apple and benefits and those workers at the union store unionized or not getting those benefits and then they're getting ready right for a second voted another store whether or not those Apple workers want to be part of a union. We are seeing after decades of union membership going down, we're seeing an uptick. We are in Home Depot among the latest examples. Yeah, I think interest is a really good way to describe it Carol. Home Depot employees in Philadelphia are going to vote on November 2nd and November 5th on whether to make theirs the company's first unionized US store. The election will be held in person on the company's premises under the supervision of the National Labor Relations Board, agency spokesperson Caleb Lato said. Workers will vote on whether to join a new labor group calling itself Home Depot workers united, which petition to represent a proposed bargaining unit of about 274 employees at the store. If a majority of voters support the union and the NLRB certifies the results, the Atlanta based Home Improvement giant would be legally required to negotiate over working conditions at the store. The union has said it aims to address issues with compensation staffing and workplace respect representatives though, couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. You know, it's happening. It is happening. Listen what Home Depot said in an email quote, our open door policy is designed to assure all associates they can bring concerns directly to leadership and we have a track record of working successfully with our associates to resolve those issues. Our concerns, excuse me, well we will of course work through the NLRB process. We do not believe unionization is the best solutions for our associates. You do wonder, right? The environment we've been living in where it's such workers are in the driver's seat right when it comes to jobs and I do wonder if some of that momentum is tied to that as well and you do wonder if we start to see a downturn if some of that momentum goes away. That's a really good question. Okay. So we have Apple and Home Depot. We also got Amazon, Trader Joe's Chipotle Starbucks as well. We have around 250 cafes across the country have voted to unionize following an initial victory that was last December. All right. So we'll keep an eye on this and of course you can find all the latest reporting when it comes to unionization. You can do that. Find it on the Bloomberg terminal as well as at Bloomberg.com.

All right Charlie, thank you so much. Well the story that keeps on kiving and it isn't quite over yet. We're talking about Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter and this week in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine the cover story is about Twitter and how it faces only bad outcomes if Elon's $44 billion deal closes. That piece by Kurt Wagner, he's technology reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us on the phone from San Francisco this afternoon. Also with us is Joel Weber the editor of Bloomberg Business Week in the Bloomberg Interactive broker studio. You can follow Joel on Twitter at Joel Weber show and Kurt Wagner at Kurt Wagner 8. Hey Kurt I want to send it over to you to start with this afternoon. So you can't, it's like you wins it's like there's no good outcome here is my big takeaway from your story because the company has been so beat up over the drama and if it goes through then what does that look like? Yeah and that's what we've been talking about for a couple months now is that what is the end result here and I think it became apparently abundantly clear excuse me that no matter what happens Twitter the company is in for a crazy ride and if Elon gets Twitter as we are starting to expect that's going to leave the layoffs, cost cuts, we're going to rescind a lot of the rules around the speech and misinformation is the expectation so you know suddenly this service that's incredibly important is going to look and feel very different and the company is going to look until different. Now it for some reason that deal falls apart suddenly you still have a company that you know has spent the last six to nine months just in total chaos and they have to kind of pick up and try and pretend like nothing ever happened and I just don't think that that's realistic either so you know the story was meant to kind of give people a glimpse into what the Twitter employees are feeling right now which is a lot of which is a lot of chaos. Tough place to be in a deal web or the editor Bloomberg Businessweek magazine also with us first of all can I just say the cover and you made Elon it's nice pecs there. Yeah he's got some good biceps to so Chris we've been talking about this for months you know it's obviously probably the one of the biggest business stories of the year and and I'm curious you know one of the things that you had in here was even some new stuff about you know what the employees really felt about their potential new boss so so take us take us there and sort of these slacks that you were able to get. Well there's two scenes that are in the book the first one is from early 2020 Elon showed up at the Twitter off site with the entire company and he complained about bots and you know at that point everyone kind of just sort of shrugged it off like here's just a popular user who has an issue fast forward two and a half years and suddenly Elon is still complaining about bots but now you know when he addresses employees and in all hands in June the vibe is very different right it's no longer here's this outside kind of tech celebrity showing up to give us advice it's here's the new boss starting to you know lay down the the future of the company and employees were not happy you know he alluded to layoffs he alluded to other cost cuts maybe getting rid of remote work which a lot of people at Twitter have really come to enjoy and so on slack they're basically mocking that there's soon to be boss as he's speaking to them you know there's things like hey it's too early to get a drink like this guy doesn't know what he's talking about and you know they just give you a sense of like how unhappy a lot of Twitter employees are with this right that they would openly mock kind of the new boss during the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2230,2022-10-12 18:55:19
14005, and you know that just gives you a sense of like how unhappy a lot of twitter employees are with this right that they would openly mock kind of the new boss um... during the the opening q&a with with staff and uh... i just think that it's only gonna get worse from here because there's a lot that's happened in the last couple months to make him even less attracted to a lot of twitter employees okay so what you cut he he ends up let's say he has to cut this check forty four billion dollars right don't bounce that jack clinton be unfortunate uh... he he he's uh... he becomes you know owner of twitter um... after all of this what what chess moves go down from there do you do we think yeah i think there's a few things um... first and foremost i imagine he's gonna put in or probably put in his own executive team he's he's been pretty open that he has you know no faith in the current leadership at twitter we expect that's a your progar called to be new new people at the top of this company and i think the other thing is you know he's talked a lot about wanting to be bring quote free speech back to twitter right and and what does that mean well for starters it means reversing permanent bands so we might see president come back on twitter quite soon we might see other people have been banned back on twitter but i also think he's you know it sounds like he plans to get rid of a lot of the rules around harassment and hate speech and misinformation that twitter has been building over the last couple years that's gonna have a huge impact on just the vibe of of what it feels like the scroll through your twitter timeline right i don't know exactly how quickly all that stuff can be unraveled i imagine um... you know twitter might feel very different to people in the next couple months that's a really interesting point heard that's one why really wanted to hit on because there is a you know there's got to be a portion of people who think that this is a good thing i've seen a playout on twitter and you see a lot of people say wait a second this is a good thing for twitter because you know this is going to be more about quote-unquote free speech so what else does it look like on the other side of this if this does go through does it actually attract more people does it become a more attractive platform or do those protections that must potentially takes away or could take away does that hinders people's hinder people's experience on it well you know what's funny is um... there was a time probably three or four years ago when twitter was still very much struggling with all this hate speech and harassment stuff and there were people leaving right like hey i don't want to be on this hellside i don't want to you know that there's a um... a lot of mean things that about twitter and people were saying that they were leaving right and then donald trump got to uh... band and people said well now everyone's going to leave twitter because they banned president trump and in both cases the numbers didn't really reflect either of those things right like it was it was mostly people complaining about this but the majority of users stuck around now in this case i think that's probably the same thing that's gonna happen right there will be people who are happy to see some these rules uh... rescinded some people will be very sad but for the most part i imagine most people will probably stick around at least in the near-term hey kirk one thing i'm curious about too though is you know elan musk has a lot on his plate will be ultimately hot you know have a deputy really you know running things at twitter how do we anticipate it might play out yeah this is this is still an unknown um... you know i i mentioned that i think the current executive team is probably gonna be out the door but who does he bring in to to run the day to day it doesn't seem really feasible for him to do that considering his responsibilities at space x and test well um... but one thing he did tell employees in june and that we mentioned the story is he said he doesn't really care much about titles like is he the cio is something else but he wants to make the decisions he wants people to listen to him you know so i do think he's going to be pretty involved at least in the direction of where this company is going now if you if he the one who's going to be you know answering emails uh... all day about product weeks i don't know seems unlikely but he does claim he wants to be heavily involved here i love the last line of your story about i guess uh... what what title a role musk will be and he says i don't really care what the title is but obviously people do need to listen to me right now who's in charge all right great story it is the coverage story of the new issue of the business week which will be out on new stance tomorrow online already at bloomberg dot com slash business week and on the blue bird terminal what what's the over under on whether or not that title has the letter x in it something that he's just totally obsessed with you ino heclears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2231,2022-10-12 18:59:58
14006," And already at Bloomberg.com slash business we can on the Bloomberg terminal. What what's the over under on whether or not that title has the letter X in it? Something that he's just totally obsessed with, you know, you know, X. It's a whole new dimension for where where you can go here and like, you know, you thought Mars was the last one. So, oh my gosh. And it ain't over yet. Whether the final friends here. All right. Well, thanks to Kurt Wagner Bloomberg News Technology, you're putting of course to a webber a business week. This is countdown to the close just 60 minutes left in your training session, Caroline Hyde Remain, you're all stick Taylor Riggs. Sorry, remain, remain. I mean, I'm so excited about that they're being raised in the metaverse that I can't get over to people's names. Carol Maser, Tim Sennevika with us of course, as we go TV radio, YouTube somewhere on the metaverse too. I'm looking. Sennevika, that's a harder name to pronounce. I'm just overwhelmed by the lack of volume that are in these markets that I can't go over. That's okay. Oh my gosh. Tough grad. Listen, we're bouncing around on the equity trade. We know that even after those FOMC minutes, but I've been looking at the airline stocks because they have definitely showed some app performance over the last couple of days. Up another 1.6% if you look at the S&P super composite airlines. American, which we know up there, guidance yesterday, continuing to move higher up about 4% in today's trade than Delta. We get their earnings tomorrow and that stocks up about 1.6%. So we continue to see some investor upbeat momentum into these names, Tim. Well, let's go see some underperformance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2232,2022-10-12 19:03:58
14007," Delta, we get their earnings tomorrow, and that stocks up about 1.6%. So we continue to see some investor upbeat momentum into these names, Tim. Well, let's go see some underperformance. The socks just cannot catch a break. A fresh 52 week load today underperforming the broader indices down 8, 10% of 1%. Down for a fifth day in a row, and in that time, it's shed nearly $280 billion in market cap. It's not the full story, though, about what's going on. If you peel back the layer and look at the movers in the socks, because we should say that Intel is the best performer in there up on that Bloomberg exclusive from Mark Herman and Debbie Wu about the company planning a major reduction in headcount that could number in the thousands. I know Mark was on your air a little earlier. He was on our air as well, talking about that story. I mean, really is. Just an area of continued pressure. Meanwhile, we're pretty much flat across the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ impact on the day. So big tech up only eight points at the moment. We're up 65 points on the Dow, so that's up about a quarter of a percent. But really, the S&P unchanged on the day. After those Fed minutes, with volumes off by about 6% the Russell 2000 is also unchanged. Look, we are in weight and sea mode for CPI. It feels like. And you're feeling that weight and sea mode by 5050 split on the individual sector levels here. Take a look in the green energy back on top after being a significant lagger of the last few days. You're up about 1% staples and discretionary are also in the lead as well. Pepsi, of course, looking at you when we think about some of those individual names to the downside remain. This is a very interesting story. Because bonds yields are falling. And yet, real estate and utilities are also the worst performers on the day. Typically, that's not something you see. Yeah, not something you see here. And I do want to go back to Pepsi. I mean, those shares actually have a pretty good day. And it really kind of ratifies the fear, I think, of a lot of folks out there that some of these companies are going to continue with these price increases. Pepsi made it very clear here that its strategy going forward is to kind of maintain some of those price increases here in order to sort of blunt its own costs. That's good for investors. Shares up 4% here on the day. Maybe not necessarily for consumers. Speaking of which, take a look at cinema holding is down about 4% here on the day. And interesting downgrade over at Credit Suits today. Talking about how a movie attendance overall, not just at cinema, but overall is not going to return to those pre-pandemic levels and that investors need to adjust their expectations. Uber shares rebounding up to the big sell off from yesterday up about 5%. And meta platforms, down another percent here on the day of 127, 18, back down to those sort of 2018 levels here as Mark Zuckerberg continues to roll out of the metaverse with legs. With legs with a 1,500-pull-up price tag. Do you think those, how much of the legs? Did you see that video though? Only Mark and whoever else he was with had legs. Everyone else. The audience has the power of having and controlling all the voting shows. You get legs. The rest of the investors just get from the win stuff. If they can give everyone legs, then I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, that's the breaking point for you, too. No metaverse in you. Exactly. Well done, and then they will come. Meanwhile, I mean, let's sobering thought that not everyone has legs in the metaverse. Sobering thought on this great chart that comes from one peakedeer terrace. We always thank him for it. Only 63 S&P 500 members are showing as oversold on the 14-day RSI scale. I wonder if Meta is one of them. But despite we've had 15 daily falls in the last 20, we've got nine of them where, what is it? Over 1% 10 of these days, we've had more than 400 daily losses, but still only 63 S&P 500 members are actually technically oversold. Does that give you worry or does that give you encouragement? Worry because, I mean, where's the capitulation? Where's the actual buy signal in that? Did we already get it? Yeah, we moved on. People bought the dip. I don't think so. Well, that's certainly a question. No question though when it comes to pivoting, right? I feel like we got that in the FOMC minutes today. We certainly got it from Loretta Mester, president of the Cleveland Fed. She stopped by Bloomberg headquarters last night, talking with our Kathleen Hayes. She talked about the neutral rate, the Fed funds rate approaching neutral. She says it needs to be above neutral for a time to bring down inflation. So it means no pivot. Check it out. The real issue is we need to do more. We have not seen inflation move back down. And we need to see that because leaving inflation where it is, it continues. There's a higher chance that it does become embedded in the economy. And of course, that's Loretta Mester of the Cleveland Fed. And president there, speaking with our Kathleen Hayes last night, Nilkush Garry also out today saying the bar very high for a pivot to happen. Yeah, I mean, we know this Fed is 100% focused on bringing down inflation. And that's why.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2233,2022-10-12 19:09:02
14008," No, Kashkari also out today saying the bar very high for a pivot to happen. Yeah, I mean, we know this Fed is 100% focused on bringing down inflation. And that's why we're going to be watching those numbers so closely tomorrow. But, you know, 8.1 from 8.3%. That's not really that substantial of a decline. And I think that's a serious concern. It doesn't bowed well after the PPI numbers. I'm reading just the latest note from some of the economists and the initial reaction after that PPI data services remain is just continuing to be really stronger. Now up another 6.10% of 1% after 4.10% of 1% increase last month. You are seeing a little bit at least on the good side coming off a little bit. But the service aside is still continuing to show some strength. A little bit though, but back to the good side. I mean, I was looking at a great write up by the folks over at Bloomberg economics who kind of talked about they are actually anticipating a little bit of a re-acceleration. And at least in certain goods like that, I want to get that report tomorrow. So, be interesting to see sort of what the balance is. And remember, this is after four or five months of oil prices coming down. What then if we've got yet more supply chain snarls, if we've got a more antagonization between Russia and Ukraine, if we've got more oil price on the higher side, yes, it's down on the day. But the 17% run up last week, what does that mean for inflationary pressures, not just in the core, but outside it, of course. A lot of variables out there, right? That could have impact, excuse me, the global inflation parade going forward. I thought it was interesting in the minutes today. It said participants commented that they expected inflation pressures to persist in the near term. So maybe that's a little bit of a clue of what we might get in that CPI. But nobody expects it to come down dramatically. I got to use this opportunity to put in a plug for Steve Matthews, a profile of Jim Bollard from the St. Louis Fed. Any story that includes a bicycle is a story as an anecdotal lead is a story that has me. Yeah, that was a great read. Definitely, everyone check it out on your terminal. Yeah, what was it, the fact that he overall tried to buy a bike and then they charged him extra for when it arrived four months later, for me, it was the supply chain issue, rather than inflationary pressure, too. We all have that moment though, right? That I don't know where we actually felt. But we all have that moment where we felt inflation actually hit us. We all have that moment. And even you even have that moment if you're in official with the Federal Reserve. That story reminded us that in January of 2021, core inflation was 1.4%. Yeah. Right? Some perspective. All right, guys, we're going to be back in less than an hour's time, our cross-platform coverage on Radio TV YouTube will continue. We will count you down with Beyond the Bell, count you down to the close on this Wednesday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Wednesday, Carol Maser, Tim Stenevig. What are you thinking? I'm thinking of something that Molly Smith just sent to me. Which is interesting. Because she is pouring over the minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting. And you heard me make that comment about Pepsi. Yeah. The idea that people could be trading down and spending money on less fancy snacks. Well, she heard me say that because she was in here and she sent me this quote about, you know, quote unquote, downshifting. Quote, these participants also noted that the composition of spending by low to moderate income households who were affected by to a greater degree by high food energy and shelter prices was changing with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lower cost options. So those who have less to work with essentially, um, that you're saying? It's exactly what I'm saying. It's something that we heard from some of the, um, not the fast, well, it is something that we heard from fast casual restaurants, right? We heard it from Chipotle CEO Brian Nicol, when we interviewed him. Gosh, Carol, that was a few months ago. It was a while. And he said people aren't going to as expensive of restaurants and instead they're downshifting to Chipotle. Right. So they stand to benefit from this. I mean, you do think about it, wait, when you're dealing with higher prices persistent, if you don't also have, if your savings are being brought down, right, you've got to rethink about how you're spending money. I went to the grocery store on the way home yesterday and, um, scanned everything I had a time before taking it up to check the prices because, you know, there's like two or three options of everything you can buy. Some price differences, three bucks. You know, something like, you know, plastic bags or garbage bags. It's like, do I really need a name, Brian? Probably not. Definitely not. You really do think about it. But if you want full coverage and full write-throughs on those Fed minutes, be sure to check out the story in the right there.

14009," The latest world and national news for that we go to our newsroom in a DC. Hey, Nance. Thanks, Tim. The Biden administration is considering a complete ban on Russian aluminum as a counter punch to Russia's barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine. Today, NATO's defense ministers met in Brussels to discuss next steps in support of the war. Bloomberg's European correspondent Maria today with more. The NATO Secretary General, he was crystal clear what the country needs right now is air defense systems. He needs to be able to protect itself from the air. And in fact, if you look at some of the moves by the Russian army over the past three days, it seems we're going back to the old strategy. There's stuck and defendant positions on the ground, so they move to the air. And there's a lot of damage that is done to Ukraine when you fight a war like that from the skies. Bloomberg's Maria today. Senator Richard Blumenthal says Saudi Arabia has not only thumbed its nose at the U.S. but has given us a gut punch for leading OPEC plus to cut oil production. He's proposing a one-year pause in U.S. sales of all arms, repair, supplies, and support to the Saudis. The Saudis need to come to their senses. They have committed a humongous blunder. Very much against their own economic and security interests, as well as ours. Blumenthal also criticized Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses and the murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi. President Biden has said there will be consequences for the Saudis, but he's not said what they would be. U.S. regulators say Pfizer and Moderna Oma-Cron boosters are safe for young children. They've approved their emergency use. The Pfizer shot can be given to kids as young as five. The Moderna boosters can be used for kids as young as six. The FDA director will now need to sign off.

You are listening to Bloomberg Business. We curl master along with Tim Stenevich, live in our Bloomberg interactive broker studio. We've been having our Bloomberg team some great interviews with well-known folks in the investment space. And that included David, I'm Horan. You heard it with our Shannali Balsic yesterday. He's the founder of Greenlight Capital. He was among hedge fund managers wagering on Twitter. And he said he believes that Elon Musk will go through with his deal to buy the social media company this year. It is the biggest long bet that he's made this year. Here's what he said. Quote, it's pretty much the only size of a long investment we've made the entire year because we've been very cautious with the bear market. This, according to an interview that he gave to Bloomberg TV yesterday, which is not a Balsic, as you mentioned, Carol. Quote, investing is something like Twitter, which I think investing in something like Twitter, which I think will resolve this year, is good because I should get the cash out to redeploy into the next thing. It's interesting, too. And we've talked about this, right? Certainly, I think with Arjun Grasso and others in the legal space, Sergei Fihi, right? Fihi. Fihi, excuse me, who's been covering it, the trial. But Einhorn said earlier this year that the laws tied to M&A, mergers and acquisitions are clear, and that the Delaware Chance Record would uphold a deal. The Musk has tried to pull out of the purchase, who revived his bid and reached the weeks of the original price of that $54.20 share. But the law is the law, right? And when you have these contractual obligations, when it comes to things like this. So how big is that investment? Sizeable. Sizeable. That's right. He didn't disclose this full stick. He said, though, quote, S. Reelons reputation, I don't believe it will be changed one way or another. Yeah, so it's interesting to think about, you know, when all of this is going on and we talked with our Mark German, you know, about the changes potentially to come at the company, the impact on employees, but at the same time, you know, it's an investment play in a big way, especially because we've seen movement in the stock. Yes, speaking of movement in the stock shares bouncing around a little bit. They are flat right now, but they were higher earlier, lower earlier, and exactly flat. $50.06 carol, so Shia, that $54.20 figure. Does did a quick scan, the holding, holding function. Yeah. I don't see green light cap, but I'll come it up. So, quarterly, right? Yeah, that's true. So maybe it hasn't been updated.

Breaking news over you Bloomberg-type squawk. Ask you a WK on your term online. Charlie Palabat is a Bloomberg business flash. Hey Charlie, thank you so much for that update. Hey, we just talked about airline. Our idea of airline stocks really some outperformance today. The rally in American Airlines alone up again and up around 5 percent in the past two trading days. The US carrier yesterday lifting its forecast and its guidance above prior guidance. American officially reports next week. So does United meantime we've got Delta reporting tomorrow. All right, for a roundup of what to expect from airlines and already what we've heard. We turn to Colin Scarola, equity analyst at CFRA Research. Colin joins us this afternoon on the phone from New York City. So Colin, as Carol mentioned, we've already heard from a pre-announcement from American Airlines. What does that tell us? What we learned from American yesterday? What does that tell us about what to expect across the wider industry? Well, thank you for having me first of all. Specifically as a race related Delta's earnings release tomorrow. I think what the American numbers tell us is that pricing across the industry, ticket pricing, is held up really strong. We haven't seen that sort of thing. Anyone who's tried to book a flight anywhere realizes that, right? I mean, we're trying to decide if we drive for Thanksgiving or fly because it's so expensive, Colin. Right. I think what a lot of industry watchers were expecting was that big spring wave of booking would drive up the prices, but then they would start trailing down a bit over the summer. But it's been, you know, from American standpoint, and I expected to be the same for Delta tomorrow. It's been great for them to see that the pricing really isn't coming down because maybe they're seeing a little bit of trailing down in domestic, but as they bring those international flights back, you see the brand new, that first big booking wave hitting the international markets. And that's keeping, I think, overall pricing very strong. I feel like everybody Colin right now is going overseas. I mean, everybody talking about, we talked about Katie Griflechuse overseas right now. She probably listening right now because she just can't take her break. She's like all this is tweeting a lot too. But Colin, what I'm wondering is, so what are the big macro dynamics? Is this just a case of people who were stuck in their homes during the pandemic buying stuff they probably didn't need? And now they're going out just kind of enjoying life and being back to normal and experiencing things. Is it that, but is it also reduced capacity, reduced workers? And so it's just kind of supply demand dynamics at work in the airline industry. Yeah, it's a little bit of both. So you get you get unusually high demand with unusually low supply. And that's where this sort of 25, 30% increase in pricing comes from relative to 2019. And just a few anecdotes, I think we have a record number of weddings happening in the US this year and next year. That's the type of thing that's driving that leisure travel demand plus the vacation demand getting to Europe wherever it might be that people used to love to go. And then what's good to see for the industry is we saw the consumer and the households have that huge pent up demand streak this spring and summer. And I think now we're starting to see it from businesses as well. You look at a lot of the accounting and consulting firms who used to have people out on the road working at client sites four days every week. That sort of Monday morning Thursday night travel routine. That seems to be coming back in a pretty big way now, this fall and into this winter. So what started with the pent up demand on the consumer and leisure side, that you know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2237,2022-10-12 19:25:40
14012, in a pretty big way now uh... this fall into this winter so what started with the pen up demand on the consumer and leisure side that you know it's still strong it hasn't run its course it's still very strong but it's certainly not growth anymore i don't think right now international business are starting to see that same sort of big pent up demand way so overall uh... very good things for the airlines and they look like extremely cheap stocks to me generally that's interesting how strong demand is colin do we ever do we ever see business travel resume to twenty nineteen levels and i ask because friend of mine is an event planner for uh... for company she plans conferences and she was saying it is so much more economic economical to do these virtual conferences the lead generation that we get per cost is just so much better it's so much lower uh... and she's like i don't see us ever going back to you know what we're doing before the pandemic because it was just too expensive yeah i did it's tough to make a call on that i hear i hear pieces of information like you just relayed but then i also hear from a lot of surveys on businesses that you just can't replace face-to-face interaction i think my my due to the lead towards that it will come back bigger than it was american airline specifically they reported on small and medium business revenues they're actually up ten percent versus twenty nineteen uh... in the past q two already small and medium businesses seem to be putting in greater demand for air travel than they were before the pandemic and it's not a given that corporate you know the larger corporates will follow that same track right but i i certainly think that's the most likely outcome just because i think people want to get back to seeing their clients and co-workers hey callin not to be debbie downer just got about thirty seconds i just want to squeeze in if we go though to a downturner maybe we're already in it but if something protracted happen certainly into next year are the airlines in good shape to weather it and again just got about thirty seconds yeah i think of a recession would not hit the airlines as acutely as it as it has historically because of the the pent up demand factor uh... so there's a section in my view it's hitting goods producing industries where services like air travel will do pretty well because there's that natural off set from the pent up alright well good to know hey callin thank you so much callin scarola equity analyst over at cfr a research on the phone in york city don't forget american united next week in delta reporting tomorrow i believe more in the morning and uh... yeah i get it this tickets for things giving relic or yet,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2238,2022-10-12 19:30:01

I don't really drink on a holiday anymore. You know, but do you go Frito-lay? I've had some Fritos from time to time. You probably drink stuff and you don't even know Pepsi. I will neither confer nor deny. You probably drink stuff and you don't even know Pepsi. That's a good point. Alright, we're going to talk Pepsi earnings because investors certainly like the results. We'll get to that in just a moment. First up, though, back to Charlie Belly. Hi, thank you very much. And here's what's going on. We've got the Dow Hire and Edstank Hire S&P remaining in the red key takeaway, though, little change. Do you want to begin, though, with a headline from the Bloomberg Professional Service? TikTok parent, Bite Dance, is planning a music streaming expansion, this according to Dow Jones' developing story. But we've got the headline for you right now on the Bloomberg Professional Service. Equities are trading mixed, 28 minutes to go ahead of the closing bell. Let us begin, though, with the 10-year yield 3.90%. 2-year yielding 4.28%. Stocks are moving a little change right now. At least that is true for the S&P. We've got the price of oil moving lower by 2.5% West Texas, in the media crude, at 87.14 in a barrel down now by 2.5%. Spot gold, a 5.10% to 1% 16.73 the ounce on gold. As for the Nasdaq 100 index, up now by about 2.10% the Nasdaq 100 index at 10.807. Well, tomorrow morning we get the latest consumer price data. We'll be very closely watched. That number breaks at 8.30am Wall Street Time, complete coverage and reaction here on Bloomberg. ADP Chief Economist, Neila Richardson, says at CPI reading, may not bring much change. There's too much uncertainty in the world, so we might see a little bump up and down in that core read, as well as the fact that it could stay at the level of the sad that it could plateau for a while. So I'm not expecting major changes this week. Bank earnings will be front and center on Friday when JP Morgan Chase, city group Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley kick off their industries. Earnings, reports, shares of the banks are higher right now. JP Morgan Chase, up 1.9% city group up 1.5%. Wells Fargo, up 1.3% and Morgan Stanley, little changed up by about 1.10% So again recapping, S&P little change swinging between gains and losses. Just a might snap a 5 day losing streak with the S&P up now by 1.10% After earnings, PepsiCo up 4.3% Coca-Cola up by 1.3%. I'm Charlie Palatette, as a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much as you just heard from Charlie. Share the PepsiCo they are rallying today, and that is on the back of what we got from the company, lifting its outlook, drink, snack, sales, bucking, inflation, meaning the company is still able to hike prices to battle inflation. So it was a strong quarter. It was, and to help us understand what specifically was strong about it and how we can read into Pepsi's results for other companies, we've got Geralt Pascarelli joining us. Senior Vice President of Equity Research at Wedbush Securities, Jail joining us on the phone from New York City. I could have you with us this afternoon, Jail. Really appreciate you taking the time. What did we find out from Pepsi about the strength of the consumer? Because they were able to raise prices and people paid. Thank you very much for having me on the show. It was a great earnings from Pepsi. I think that when you look at the leading trends heading into earnings, which are typically going to come from scanner data and meal center, IRI, what you saw was just a continued strengthening of growth across really cold beverages as well as snacks. With Rita Lay for Pepsi.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2240,2022-10-12 19:38:45
14015," was just a continued strengthening of growth across really cold beverages as well as snacks. With RIDO-LAY and FRAP-C, that accounts for over 40% of their total company profits. And the Sulti-Snacks data has just been fantastic. They're back to gaining market share and they're actually in scanner data doing over 20 points of price. And so we thought it was going to be a good print. They delivered a good print. And what you really saw was price-led revenue growth across most of these segments, which is really not only driving a strong top line, but it's helping to protect against these outsized levels of commodity inflation. And it was really strong across the board when you look at all of their segments. I just want to make sure I heard right. FRADO-LAY and PepsiCo, you said are 40% of the profits. You talk about PepsiCo that brand and then it's FRADO-LAY brand. So FRADO-LAY is a segment with that Pepsi reports on. And that's that segment in particular. FRADO-LAY North America is 40% of total company profits. So it's meaningful. It's the biggest profit driver. And when you're getting 20 points of price mix and they actually reported 20 points of price mix, which is kind of in line with what we've been seeing in scanner, you're going to have good profitability. OK, so far so good in terms of having the ability to raise price prices. As you know the macro conversation, we often talk about the Fed continuing to raise rates, the prospect of recession, what kind of recession it would be. How much more can PepsiCo do something like this? Yeah, I think that as of right now, pricing remains robust and the volume, the demand elasticity, the volume impact has been relatively muted, which is encouraging. I don't think anyone's expecting this strong double-digit pricing to persist. And if you kind of look at where consensus estimates were for 2023 heading into the quarter, they're expecting a normalization to the mid-synchle digit range. And so I think as you get more through the fourth quarter and then into 2023, you'll likely see a normalization in this pricing, which in turn should result in some better volume throughput as part of the revenue algorithm. But as of right now, these are essentially lower price needs-based products, which is one of the benefits in the current environment is that consumers need these products. And they're relatively low price, so you can generate pretty meaningful price mix. Hey, Jared, what about when it comes to Coca-Cola? And what this means for Coca-Cola, because there's no Frito Leia Quivelin at Coca-Cola. There's not. But encouragingly, I did mention Frito as a segment that was delivering strong pricing, but they're actually getting strong pricing in cold beverages as well. And when you look at some of the trends for Coke, Coke's actually getting the best price mix, because they are the market leader within carbonated soft drinks, which is the most important category for them. So I think that this is definitely a positive read on Coca-Cola, even though they don't have a snack segment, we would expect this strong pricing that we've seen for Pepsi to persist with Coke, as well as Kira Dr. Pepper. One thing to note about Coke, the shares have definitely sold off. I know there was, you know, broad market pressure over the course of September, but these shares didn't sell off more so than some of the other non-alcoholic beverage peers. And that's largely due to currency and some concern around the European consumer. I'll just... Right. No....the audience said, you know, Coca-Cola is 66% international. No, it's... Yeah, we have to think about the global component, the currency component, when it comes to something like Coca-Cola, which is up by the 1% on the back of that Pepsi-Co news. Gerald Pascarelli of Wedbush, thank you. Let's get to world of national news with Nancy Lions and our DC News. Thanks, Tam.

14016," Bloomberg's Nathan Hager reports. The White House is considering a total ban on Russian aluminum. It is a move that has not been considered before since aluminum is so important in everything from cars to skyscrapers and iPhones. Sources tell Bloomberg news three options are on the table. An outright ban, tariff so high, they'd amount to a ban or sanctions on Russia's main aluminum producer, Rousal. Russia is second only to China as the world's biggest aluminum supplier. A ban could leave consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere scrambling to find a replacement metal. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. NATO defense chiefs met in Brussels today to discuss how to better protect critical infrastructure, ramp up weapon production, and maintain support for Ukraine. U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin spoke of Russia's recent bombardment of civilian targets in Ukraine. The whole world has just seen yet again the malice and cruelty of Putin's war of choice, rooted in aggression, and waged with deep contempt for the rise of war. Austin told them that the U.S. aid to Ukraine now totals nearly $17 billion.

Okay. So I think I just sent it to you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Everything's okay. All right, folks. Don't worry. We've got everything under control. So we just talked about the airline industry just a little while ago. We've got Delta Airlines in the morning. We've got American and United next week. American of course pre-nounced really. yesterday. So Dow Jones, Wall Street Journal has a story at that frequent flyers who grew accustomed to relaxed rules for reaching elite airline status during the pandemic. Well, now carriers are racing the bar for owning rewards, leaving casual travelers with little recourse. I've been kind of waiting for this to happen. Well, you and I are not those who have status on these planes, right? You don't have any more. I think I still have status. You do? Yeah. Like they've carried over some good, like if you had status, sorry, Tim. Yeah. Well, that's why I guess you get to get on first and I'm just like stuck at the back. I'm like, see ya. Yeah, that's true. So as working international travel dried up two years ago, airlines made it easier for people to maintain and earn status. This was a bid to retain their business. So that meant the number of customers enrolled in loyalty programs ballooned. It made it harder for flyers to attain perks like upgraded seats and lounge access. Yeah. The problem is according to the chief executive of the Browley group, it's consulting from that focuses on customer loyalty programs. He said the problem right now is there are just too many people with the status. Now last week Delta became the latest carrier to raise the bar and how much money customers must spend to reach the highest tiers of rewards, following a similar change implemented this year by American airlines. I mean, they're getting tougher about this. Yeah, for those who have continued elite status, the changes stand to free up access to first class upgrades and other perks. So it's better news for those people who've flown a ton in the last couple of years. Those who are now at risk of losing status say it might not be worth the hassle to start from scratch, building up miles with a new airline. Instead, some flyers say they might be scrambling to spend more on credit cards or buying pricier seats to qualify. We should have had Charlie pellet come in on this one. Yeah, we need him to weigh in on this. Like is it getting tough? Because he really has had to work around the system.

I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update Charlie Palette. It's 349 on Wall Street. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. By early next year the US government will likely run out of money to pay for COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments. Although President Joe Biden has requested more support from Congress, Republicans are in no mood to continue spending on the pandemic, shifting more costs to the private sector makes sense, but some level of government funding is still necessary. Lawmakers should agree on a more limited approach that ensures the US is still prepared to fight the next pandemic. That means for example that Congress should continue to authorize funding for basic research, the development of new vaccines and therapeutics and manufacturing capacity. In ways big and small the US is moving on from COVID with a bit of foresight the federal government should be able to manage this transition while keeping Americans safe. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. For more Bloomberg opinion please go to Bloomberg.com slash opinion or OP I and go on the Bloomberg terminal. This has been Bloomberg opinion. We're watching markets bounce around getting ready for inflation per cent and you know what we're talking about? Maybe Murphy. Yeah you know a little blast from the past but we're really pleased this afternoon because we've got Victoria Green, she's chief investment officer at SheSquared Private. Well she's with us right now in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio interviewed you like a dozen times never met you in person Victoria so welcome back to New York. It's good to have you here. What brings you to the city? Some of it was just to do a little bit of work and have a couple meetings and then obviously I hadn't met a lot of the my Bloomberg friends in person so I want to come say hi and and meet everybody so it's been great. By the way your free snacks amazing. We do have good snacks here. They're really really good. You can take some to go home too. We have to work now. Yeah unfortunately but you're almost done you're almost done. Give us some clarity we got Fed minutes today a reminder no pivot they're going to keep raising rates. We did see some bounce off the lows in terms of equities but we're really little change ahead of the inflation print tomorrow so how do you look at this market what's a constructive conversation to have right now. I think it's too early I still see some downside risk I think the print too early for a pivot too early for a pivot I actually have been saying the pivot is dead so everybody that's hopeful for a pivot is like wishing for like that sold out toy on Christmas I really don't think you're going to get it like I'm sorry I wish I had better news but I don't think it's coming at some point they're going to pivot it's a good it's a good it's a good stop raising rates right. At some point the dollars cowboys are probably going to win the Super Bowl again. Are you saying you never expect a Fed to like. It's a good question it's also a question I think for people who are thinking about buying a home right now if they say okay well I get locked into 30 or more than 70% interest rates are going to be high forever so maybe I could refine five years but is this the new normal. No I do think so if you look at what the Fed funds features are pricing in it comes down rather rapidly and 23 and 24 right so I think though nothing this year you know they talked about we did we rather do too much than too little I think very shortly they're going to have to switch from we need to do too little not too much because this delayed reaction of a Fed which is I feel like the momentum was there I think that was in the FOMC minutes today that they're more concerned about doing too little rather than too much yeah and at some point they're going to be much more concerned about hey we did too much we need to back off I don't think we're there yet that's my thesis we got a little bit more downside the Fed's not bailing us out you know at some point and it was a little monkey of it",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2244,2022-10-12 19:55:59
14019," Hey, we did too much. We need to back off. I don't think we're there yet. That's my thesis. We got a little bit more downside. The Fed's not bailing us out. You know, at some point, and it was a little monkey of alien, how we rallied on the UK problems that we had, because everybody said, Oh, it's going to get so bad. It's good. We're just not there yet. We had the data points from labor markets still too tight. Pepsi came out with great earnings. Like, they're stressed, but there's not. Intel came out and said it's cutting thousands. They are. The tech sector is one of those that we say avoid right now. Click the chip market for months now. It's attractive. But then you can keep getting bad news on bad news on PC sales. And that sector, like, just because of stocks down 50% doesn't mean it can't go down another 30%. And you got so many macro headwinds. Okay. So what's an investor to do in this environment? If you're saying the pivot is dead, it's too early for a pivot at this point. When do we see a bottom here? It's 34 to 32. I don't think we're that far off. But mostly because of multiples, earnings have remained rather robust. I don't think 240 is kind of the average street for next year. I think that's still a little bit too high. But even if we're flat at 225, 3,400 that gets you 15, 16 handle. That's not a bad place to be looking. But stay defensive. The biggest thing an investor can do is don't panic or don't need jerk on data. We've seen wild moves off of some of these data releases or fed moves. And in a lot of times, it's a one or two day move and comes back to trend. So I would say like one day, one week does not a market make. Like be a little bit patient. And then if you've got equities now, unless you're worried you have a zombie or something that's going to completely blow up, it really just holds on to it. We talk through a little bit cash and liquidity. Dividends are great right now. You've got tar of versus Tino because you have all these. So you would be moving aggressively into cash at this point? No, no. I think you got to, you know, no one hold them, no one to fold them. At this point, you got to hold. Unless you have something that's a credit risk or a blow up risk. What's a credit risk right now? I mean, talk about the Russell 3000 and some of the zombie companies in there or I would say not to pick on Cathywood, but some of the art fund, like the innovative stuff, the cool stuff that did so well so long right now, typically smaller companies, higher leverage, no real earnings and they're keeping raising capital. That's not a good place to be during times of stress. You want quality, you want cash flow, you want a balance sheet that can have this award, some problems. Which is why you like Costco. And you, several times have come on and you say you like Costco and I was just looking up, is it like about 13% this, I know. Down 17% this year, but I think it's had a nice little bounce from its recent low up about 13% or so. So the big reason, sorry. Well, it's just going to say the S&B 500 down to 25%. Correct. So I like them one. They make about 75% of their revenues from the US and then they're, they are international, but the remaining like most majority in Canada, which they can use. So they're a strong dollar problem. You know, a little bit dollar problems too. All of this inventory problem that Nike and Amazon and everybody have benefits a store like Costco because they're happy to buy things cheaply from Nike and resell it at Costco. They're not beholden to any brand, other than the Kirkland brand, which is amazing. But, but you know, so they have this purchasing power that other companies don't have. So Nike has to sell. Nike has to get their things off and so you have a company like Costco that can buy some of the the inventory pretty cheap and then reselled other members. They have such a loyal member base they do. And then when you're looking to stretch your dollar, buyers, socioeconomic to hire like in terms of their consumer, I don't know. I think I can hit the wrong. I got to tell you this is not like Texas Victoria. We don't have room for like, you know, 200 rolls of toilet paper in our apartments in New York City. So we're not the Costco shoppers. I figured you guys learn from the pandemic. Like you would have a toilet paper. She's got a basement full of toilet papers. So if you ever run out. No, David, I did have a solution to the lack of toilet paper. That's a different show. You're talking about it. Hey, let's move on to United Health Care before this gets too crazy. Why are you so bullish on United Health Care? First off, they have some great pricing power. I mean, anybody who's about to re up their insurance premiums next year, you know, they they have this ability to say, oh, we made record profits. But yeah, but no, they do. They've got pricing power. They're, you know, again, they have a lot more in the US. I also think technology wise with some of the acquisitions they've done. They are looking at other parts of the market, getting into the pharmacy and the telehealth. And, you know, that's what little bit like teladoc used to be the darling. But then you have the big boys getting into it. Right. And they're developing their own program. I love that you still love energy. I mean, it's hard not to if you look at the super mega uber out performance of energy this year. And it just kind of continues. Shaneer is one name. Just got about 20 seconds. Why that name? Up 66% so far this year. It was, sorry, Shaneer. Oh, Shaneer's great. So, LNG exporting. We are going to win what Russia lose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2245,2022-10-12 20:01:06

So, LNG exporting, we are going to win what Russia loses. So, they're about to have the biggest ports while we're on company, and they have the ability to expand. So, as Russia backs out, Europe's looking for national gas. They're the best position. They're also very, very well-run company. And they have the biggest ports and terminals to get it out there. Great stuff. So fun to have you in town. Come back soon. Say, Travis home. She's going to go back to Texas. Victoria Green, Chief Investment Officer, G-Squared Private Wealth here in our interactive broker studio. And folks, we just have a few minutes left in today's trading session. Just about 2.5 minutes. We're bouncing around, off our highs and lows, slight gain on the down, and the Nasdaq slightly lower on the S&P 500. Coming up next, we're going to be joined by a Bloomberg TV team for Beyond the Bell. It is live on Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg TV, and YouTube. We are counting you down to the closing bell on this Fed Wednesday. Let's see. All right. All right. Here's the last 500. Welcome in. I'm going to present the last 15 minutes. No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no. Anyway, happy hello to our global sound-like-ass partners, Tom Stenevich and Sarah Mas. Well, Rowland, it's so great that you welcome us in. I'm continuing to look at the airline industry. Some outperformance there. It's up about 1.6 percent as a group overall. Of course we had American pre-announcing yesterday. We're going to be adopted tomorrow morning and we're going Well, I'm gonna bring it back, okay? We just had Victoria Green in here in the studio, Chief Investment Officer at G-Squared Private. Well, it was great to have her. She should have stuck around for the Sommelcast. That would have actually been pretty fun. She said, too early for a pivot, the pivot is dead. Not forever, she thinks the Cowboys are gonna win a Super Bowl before there's a pivot from the Fed though. 3,200 to 3,400 could be the bottom. It was not a horrible, I mean, three in one. I mean, when I was a kid, Cowboys were the team. Yeah, they cut me. They were the team. Let's not start. I don't think they're that bad this year. I love Taylors, Newly and Sports, sufficient other. I got married and now I have to do sports. Should we do yields? For life. Bond yields anyone. Take a look at where we are, Tim. Didn't mean to cut you off either. Bond yields. Apparently the Cowboys are pretty good. I'm learning right now. Oh, boy. Did I? I don't know. Bond are catching a big. The yields have down five, six days at points across the curve. But not giving a big. And you take yields off in his hat on it. That's what you're going to have. Not you made an heaven use here in the market. So we're going to try to get back on track here. But honestly, you're not really missing a whole lot. Yeah, I'm always sublime here. Look, the Dow Jones and Desero. It's not, you sound like my second great English teacher. Dow Jones and Desero Lava are going to finish the day in the red. It actually been in the green for a good portion of the day as were some of the other indices. But pretty much everything across the board in the red. The Dow Jones and Desero Lava are down the 10th of a percent. S&P down, 3 tenths of a percent. The NASDAQ down, 10th of a percent. And the Russell 2000 are going to finish the day down by 3 tenths of a percent. All right, that's it around on those major equity averages. For the S&P 500 though, it was definitely a bearish tone. 346 names lower on the trade today. 156 higher, Taylor, one unchanged. The Dallas Cowboys are four and one. There you go, better than a three and two record. So take that, Tim. I'm listening. You're not interested in OK, too. Let's look at where we are on an individual sexual level. This has become a sports show. What's that? We're like ESPN all of a sudden. Food and beverages, we think about some of these inflationary concerns are up about one and a quarter. Energy banks as well. We've talked about lower yields. Typically not what you would see here with the banks. But continuing to be a decent outperformer household products as well, Carol. Again, this we're really looking at some of those inflationary pressures who can pass on those costs to the consumer and who cannot. Take a look at where we're down for some of the losers, Carol. Real estate, capital goods, utilities, actually typically not what you would see when yields are falling. But nonetheless, you do have real estate and utilities. Some of the worst performers are off about 3.5% for those sectors. All right, let's get to some of the individual gainers. We've all talked about it all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2246,2022-10-12 20:06:11
14021," you would see when yields are falling, but nonetheless you do have real estate and utilities. Some of the worst performers are off about three and a half percent for those sectors. All right, let's get to some of the individual gainers. We've all talked about it a lot. PepsiCo pretty much holding on to almost all of the day's gains finishing up 4.2%. We've seen it top among the names in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 today. Company lifting its outlook, drink, snack sales, bucking inflation. Meaning the company's still able to hike prices to battle inflation. Company also be profit estimates for the third quarter. So that was a standout. Also Moderna having its biggest move in two months. So big move up more than 8%. It was up more than 17% at its highs today. So pretty significant. Top of the S&P 500 Nasdaq, this I love this story. Surging as Merck ramps up its collaboration with the company on a cancer vaccine. So Moderna is going to get about a quarter of a billion dollars from Merck in exchange for joint development and future commercialization of a vaccine that's currently in mid stage clinical trials. This is all about an RNA cancer vaccine. So I really love this story. And then do want to mention Norwegian cruise line. The cruise lines were like top in the S&P 500s in Norwegian Carnival Royal Caribbean cruise lines. All rallying after UBS upgraded Norwegian to a buy from neutral. He likes the overall cruise industry. He's overweight, but he did cut his price target on Norwegian for two out 15 from $18. But nonetheless, Norwegian as I mentioned up almost 12% today's session. OK, you got the Gainers Carol. I got the Decliners, Albumar, finishing the day down by 7.9%. Lithium stocks getting hit today led by declines in this company after Morgan Stanley flagged and dropped in volumes and prices. This is because Chile September customs data showed a drop in Lithium prices in China to $55 from $70 per ton. That's according to report written by analysts at Morgan Stanley. And then the second worst performer in the S&P 500 T-Rote price today shares slumping after the asset managed reported a 24% drop in assets under management versus the same period last year. T-Rote finishing the day down by 5.1%. And blue apron, down for an eighth day in a row, another 8.6% today, losing more than 62% just over the last eight days. They stock cannot catch a break. It cannot. When food inflation is hitting in, but maybe the likes of Pepsi can pass it on. Let's look at inflation repressions from commodities perspective right now. Actually, dialing back a little bit in the all market, with WTI crew down to 1.5% Brent was off by more than 2%. This more about the world concerns, the recessionary pressure, the idea of a global slowdown, maybe taking away some of the 17% rally that we saw last week. Natural gas is also a little bit lower. I wish I had aluminium up here, of course, aluminum. You might call it, but of course, the focus in the US being that maybe we could see some retaliatory efforts on Russian metals coming into the US. And what does that mean for prices overall? We're seeing foreign exchange again, super volatile at the moment. While we see the VIX still languishing in about a 33, 4X really where it is, and a British pound that strengthens by more than a percentage point, the Bank of England, moving in to trans-sabilize the bond market. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen, weakening by 7.10% a 24-year low, when we will see further, actually efficient intervention coming from Japan to be able to stabilize versus a never-endingly strong US dollar. Overall, we are seeing a Canadian dollar loony weaken a little bit, maybe in line with oil markets. Sovereign bonds are very mixed pictures, I say, the BOE doing its job, managing to pull down the yields on the two-year very much on the front and but also on the long end, two-tailor. But it took a while to get there. They raised past 5% on that long end debt before they stepped in. We are getting some global comments as well, Caroline, from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, given some prepared remarks in Washington. And I think what's interesting is she says that they are attentive to some of the global repercussions of the Fed's policies saying that priority of course is curbing inflation. And that starts with a strong market, and you have to of course focus on some of those domestic tax, but really well aware of some of the global ramifications that are underway. Aware, but what are they doing? I mean, there have been a lot of people there. Well, but hang on, there's been a lot of people who have made the argument that what we're trying to fight now with regards to supply side inflation is much more of a task for people like Janet Yellen, folks at the Treasury, folks in the White House, folks in Congress, and not necessarily put it all on the shoulders of J. Bell on the Fed. Well, wrap up quickly, just some of these bonds. Oh, did you know that they're... No, it's okay. Yields are falling, not much new there. We know we're sort of in a decent trading pattern here, of course, ahead of CPI as we wrap up PPI. But Carol remains brings up a good point about the intersection of monetary...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2247,2022-10-12 20:09:34
14022," We know we're sort of in a decent training pattern here, of course, ahead of CPI as we wrap up PPI. But Carol remains up a good point out the intersection of monetary versus fiscal policy and who needs to do what? Well, most would say and argue, like we've talked about this a lot with J. Powell of the Federal Reserve, Global Central Bankers, they can't fix supply chains. They certainly can raise rates and we've seen it in certainly the mortgage market and the housing market. Sorry, I'm going to interrupt you, Carol. Sorry, we have some breaking news. I mean, just to go back to the fundamentals here, applied materials, the big chipmaker announcing that it's actually cutting its forecast here. Again, we're not expected to get actual results out of them for a few more weeks here, but they are trimming their forecast here, going forward. And this is really the drum beat here. We'll dive into these numbers as soon as we can get a better sense of them, but it gets to the broader theme here that we are dealing with the world. That for a lot of folks needs to contract a little bit. It's not just about inflation and the Fed. It is about some of these companies and their own customers. Well, there's a lot of play when it comes to the semiconductor industry. In that, by the way, down about 2.5% here in the after hours, we know it's the macro concerns about slowing, we're concerned about regulations coming out of the United States when it comes to dealing with China specifically. And the release they're saying that the, yeah, and their fourth quarter business outlook reflects the impact of new export regulations partially offset by supply chain performance improvements, 6.4 billion. That's the number they're looking for for the fourth quarter. That's down from a forecast of about 6.6 billion. And they do say they're trying, they say they're pursuing additional export licenses and authorizations when needed. And this is going to be the devil in the detail of how much the administration allows any sort of loopholes. But really, they say it's a global business with customer-supprizin operations located in many countries around the world. This is an impact of trade regulations at the moment. They said they're committed to compliance with them. This is the, yeah, so we should just point out, 154 to 178. That's the new range that they're giving for the fourth quarter. That's down from 182 to 218. So a pretty big cut in that EPS number as well. This is all based on the US government announcing last week new export regulations. I mean, this is the press release is just about this. The company saying applied currently estimates that the new regulations are going to reduce its fourth quarter net sales by approximately $400 million plus or minus $150 million. And how long does it take before we start to see announcements from some of the other chip makers like this? Yeah, and already the pain being felt. Just remember the scoop coming from Mark Gurman, the PC slowdown already impacting Intel, the loss of jobs that are likely to come from sales and marketing. But it's just seen headline off the headline of how poor the market is for semiconductor makers, equipment makers as well. And then you add on a layer of geopolitical risk. It's just never ending. Aimat, cutting its forecast. We are seeing the stock down in the after hours. Also in the press release saying that they expect the impact net sales in the first quarter fiscal 2023 by similar amount as in the current quarter. So this is going to weigh on the company for some time. All right, guys, that's a wrap. The headlines continue to come fast and furiously. We will continue, of course, our cross-platform coverage tomorrow on radio TV YouTube. We will count you down to the close same time, same place tomorrow. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. All right, folks. We are watching Aimat shares in the after hours. Seeing some selling this after the company cuts their forecast. Twitter net sales about 6.4 billion plus or minus 250 million. Fourth quarter just it, EPS buck 54 to 178. They had seen 182 to 218. This has to do with the new Chinese or the new US curbs that were imposed by President Biden on Friday against China. The last paragraph of this press release really sticking out. Applied business depends on international trade and the company is committed to complying with all applicable trade regulations. Let's get to Washington DC now for World of National News.

All right Nancy, thank you so much. Nancy Lyons and our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. You're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Wednesday and great story by Bloomberg News team. And it talks about Russia's President Vladimir Putin saying any energy infrastructure in the world is at risk after the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines. The attacks were an act of terror that set the quote, most dangerous precedent, the Russian President telling Amosko Energy Forum on Wednesday, quote, it shows that any critically important object of transport, energy, or utilities infrastructure is under threat. End quote, irrespective of where it is located or by whom it is managed, he said. Now the president of Russia Vladimir Putin blaming the sabotage on the United States, Ukraine, and Poland calling them beneficiaries of the blast that caused major gas leaks in the Baltic Sea. I'm sure you've all seen the bubbling pictures of that pipeline in the Baltic. The U.S. and its allies have rejected those allegations and suggest Russia may have actually been behind the underwater blast. The attacks on two strings of Nord Stream and one string of Nord Stream 2 at the end of September have raised concerns over the future of Europe's gas supplies. Your critical infrastructure in the region has also suffered damage in recent weeks. You know, Netnet, the Big Macro story we've been talking about it for months now and this is a result of the Russian invasion and war in Ukraine is, you know, we're watching the global energy supplies being impacted. Russia, such a big supplier, right, specifically to the European region and they are rethinking about, you know, where do we get energy going forward? And we've got a story coming up by our Bloomberg news team that looks specifically about energy policy here in the United States. Well, that has been, or energy I should say delivery has been completely reshaped over the last six months as the score has dragged on and the U.S. increasingly becoming a source of energy for the continent. And you know, when we talk about one of the big macro factors, we had a guest on. Actually, I think it was our Tom Orlick, you know, these questions about if it's a warmer winter in Europe, that'll be better in terms of pressures, inflationary pressures because of access to energy or high energy costs. But these are just one of the big macro factors at play when we look at the global economic outlook and what it means for global monetary policy.

How about that? There's a Bloomberg business fire. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Well another story in the upcoming new double issue of Bloomberg Business. We got tomorrow online and on the Bloomberg. It's about how President Biden is walking a tight rope as the world hunger is for US oil and gas. Really plays into the story we just talked about with President Putin and not certainly his moves every year up. We're talking about a wave of what's known as resource nationalism and it goes beyond just energy. Writing about this in Bloomberg Business week is Jennifer DeLoe, Energy and Environmental Policy reporter for Bloomberg News. She's in her 991 studio in Washington DC. Jennifer, good to have you with us this afternoon. It's a tight rope that the Biden administration has to walk right now as you write in your headline here. Explain what resource nationalism is and how the US is walking this tight rope. Well, really we're seeing this kind of resource nationalism across the world as countries look to meet the needs of their own consumers and amid inflationary pressures. And then also take care of other geopolitical concerns in the case of the US and the Biden administration. Really the concern is around energy. The President is feeling tremendous pressure to help European allies deal with energy needs especially ahead of this winter and next year because of the Ukraine crisis and energy concerns that have been exacerbated by that situation. But at the same time he's also trying to deal with domestic needs and concerns by American consumers that the price of food and energy is going up. Of course they're dealing with gasoline prices that are increasing and in the Northeast US there are concerns about home heating oil this winter. So for this President it's really a matter of balancing these geopolitical concerns with very real domestic economic concerns. Jennifer, it's a US story but it's also a global story. I think about go back to the spring of was it this year and I feel like even last year when India Bandsmex sports of wheat, you know citing a risk to its food security partly due to the war in Ukraine because it was earlier this year. I mean this is commodity or fossil fuels. People who remind us it's a fixed amount right at some point we're all going to be competing for the same stuff unless we shift to alternative modes. Right that's absolutely true. You know other examples palm oil and deniesia you know beans in Mexico. It's far bigger than just energy energy just happens to be in America in the United States it happens to be just such a big political and economic pressure point a big contributor to inflation. And of course you know America is an energy superpower. We are a large supplier of oil and gas to the world and right now that puts the President in a really unique spot. You know interestingly you know some of the bid to control the exports and the outflows of these products might not necessarily have the economic impact that American consumers want but that's part of the calculus that the White House is weighing right now. Can you talk a little bit about that like what difference it would actually make if they were to curb some of these exports. Right so the consideration is curbing really petroleum product exports gasoline or diesel not actually crude oil and that's that's a live discussion right now within the administration. It would have a mixed impact and it would not necessarily really reduce prices across across the country in fact some areas of the country would see gasoline and diesel price increases. So the Gulf Coast and the Midwest of the U.S. which is flush with with fronaries would end up being flush with product. So gasoline prices would likely decrease if you were to clamp down on exports of that product. But some areas of the country that are really restricted and don't have enough domestic supply coming in who are reliant on imports to meet their needs which includes New England as well as the West Coast. So the areas would likely see price increases that's something that we're hearing universally from analysts and and energy experts.

It is called improbable. improbable. So we're going to get to him in just a moment. First up, they'll back to your top piece of story. So in the news after the clues and Charlie coming. Indeed, it's a story you guys broke roughly 20 minutes ago. Apply materials were watching that stock. It is down now by just about 1.85 percent applied. AIMAT is the biggest maker of chip manufacturing equipment. It has slashed its forecast for the fourth quarter, saying new export regulations will hurt its sales to China. The company estimates that rules will reduce sales by about $400 million in the period. Again, apply materials after hours now lower by just about 1.8 percent. Turn out to be a down day for the Dow, the S&P and NASDAQ. If you had tuned in throughout the day, you would have told us so. You would have heard us tell you that stocks were higher in the end though. Late day fade and a move lower S&P down 11 drop. There are three tenths of 1 percent. The Dow down 28 declined today of 1 tenth of 1 percent. NASDAQ lower by 9, a drop there of 1 tenth of 1 percent. Stocks ended little change. A brief afternoon advanced faded as investors brace for tomorrow morning's reading on consumer prices. Now, what about the market backdrop? What about the Federal Reserve? Victoria Green is chief investment officer at G-Scared Private Wealth. She was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. Too early for a pivot. I've been saying the pivot is dead. Everybody that's hopeful for a pivot is wishing for that sold out toy on Christmas. I really don't think you're going to get it. I'm sorry. I wish I had better news, but I don't think it's coming. Right now we do have the 10-year yielding 3.89 percent. Two-year yielding of 4.28 percent. Spot gold up 4 tenths of 1 percent. 1672 the ounce. West Texas, in a meteor crew down 2.5 percent. 87.11 a barrel. After the bell we heard from Duck Creek and it is forecasting revenue for 2023. The guidance did beat the average analyst estimate. Duck Creek right now is trading unchanged. Again, just revisiting applied materials. Slashing its forecast for the fourth quarter shares after ours down by about 1.8 percent. I'm Charlie Palatat.

They are mixed on the Facebook pattern after hosted an event yesterday where it detailed its virtual reality initiatives and unveiled the new headset. Firms write that the company is making progress with its metaverse vision, but that remains risky and that other issues continue to weigh on the stock like legs. No. Like legs. And like I said, Carol, investors have just beaten this company up over the last year as it has made this pivot. We've got a great guest with us this afternoon. Herman Narula is the co-founder and CEO of Improbable. Also, the author of the book, Virtual Society. The metaverse and the new frontiers of human experience. Herman joins us via Zoom from London. Herman, how are you? Really good. Thanks so much for having me on the show. Well, thanks so much for joining us. I want to say you're joining us kind of like old school right now, right? You're on Zoom and we're here in person. Is there a possibility that in the near future we're going to be doing this interview in the metaverse? Oh, absolutely. And I think the cool part about it isn't so much whether we'd be having a VR headset or a phone or whatever. It's that we can have thousands of the listeners there with us and actually interact with them. That's the part of the metaverse that I'm excited about. Which I don't think companies like meta are even working on. Herman, the problem is I don't like people. I don't like people. Well, I was just kidding. You should see what these people say to Carol on Twitter. I don't know if you want them in the metaverse with you, Carol. I mean, if you're saying that you're confessing that you don't love your list, that's a big act. I do. I do. I do. I'm just having some fun with you. No, but I think we're trying to get a grasp of how the metaverse, everybody's been weighing in. How it impacts our life. It feels like it's a long time off. Your company, you are a creator of virtual world technology. You're in it. But you also know it's not an easy thing. So talk to us a little bit about the journey that we should all expect as we move potentially through the metaverse and through the metaverse. I think it's coming up sooner than we might think. And we're already doing partnerships that enable thousands of people to come together in virtual events for sports, for fashion, for music. If you're thinking about the our headsets, that's a very, very narrow, even niche part of what the larger metaverse is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2254,2022-10-12 20:39:43
14029," as for sports, for fashion, for music. If you're thinking about the R headsets, that's a very, very narrow, even niche part of what the larger net-of-us opportunity represents. The larger opportunity is something like getting a cricket fan in India on a 3G phone to have their first ever trip to a real stadium with thousands of people speaking and chanting and being together. These are the really interesting, revenue and community opportunities in the meta-verse. What does that look like from a hardware perspective? If they have a 3G phone, and they're using their smart phone to enter the meta-verse. Like, how is that different than watching this on YouTube? It's all about the presence and the opportunities within that world. So the difference is the stuff happening in the world. And this is what I think meta has kind of obscured about. How you consume the world is not as interesting as what the world is about. It's the ability to host thousands of people to have complex rich virtual worlds, which require the processing, not of thousands or millions of messages, but billions of messages on the back end. It's that back end problem that is the real problem in enabling virtual worlds. Like, to use an analogy, in the early days of the computer, everybody thought the hardware was where the money was. But Microsoft sold operating systems, one of the first software companies in the world. They captured all the margins on profit. The value wasn't in the hardware. I think VR headsets are just another commodity device that is going to add value to the conversation. The real money and the real opportunity is in taking real world communities, bringing them into virtual space, and using the sale of digital assets and complex virtual worlds to label that. I've been on a Netanyah technology journey to get there. That's where I think the value was. Herman, why is it so important that I've got an avatar in a room with other people, even if it's a lot of people? Why is that so important? And how does that advance society and how we get things done or how we do things? It's all about what I would call the fulfillment icon. And I cover this a lot in my book. So everybody needs fulfilling interactive experiences, not just for their mental health and their well-being, but as a form of self-actualization. This is a well-understood area of psychology. So when you go to a sporting stadium, when you play a completely game, or you play around of golf, you're not just having fun. You're actually being fulfilled. You're having a very important need map. And the more we can allow people to have fulfilling experiences, the better their lives become. And frankly, the more money they're going to spend on the important aspects of realizing that, the thought. But how is the metaverse going to feel the same of me watching or being at a game versus me actually being at the game? And we only get about 30 seconds, then we'll come back and talk some more. But how is that? I don't know. It's all about your ability to express yourself. Imagine the idea of bringing thousands of fans not just into the world, but in a way where they can have a two-way conversation with a performer or a celebrity, or somebody that they could never meet or engage with in the real world. Communities are very one way right now. And a lot of brands and companies make a ton of money, but leave a lot of money on the table because they can't have an introduction. All right, we got lots more to come. Herman Sitteit, for a second. We'll come back to you in just a moment. Herman Naurula, co-founder and chief executive officer of Improbable.

A Connecticut jury is ordering Alex Jones to pay nearly a billion dollars to multiple families of Sandy Hook Survivors. The Info Wars host and conspiracy theorist had already been found liable in a Texas court over his repeated claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook School Massacre was a hoax. The plaintiffs alleged that Jones made millions of dollars off those claims and caused his followers to torment the families of the victims. The House January 6th Committee is getting ready for what may be. It's final public hearing tomorrow. The panel is expected to focus on repeated warnings. Former president Donald Trump received about the threat of violence ahead of the attack on the Capitol. Sources tell the Washington Post the committee will present new video footage and internal secret service emails that may corroborate parts of former White House aid Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony. She told the committee in June that the former president was told some of his supporters were armed and that he clashed with secret service agents who insisted he stay away from the march to the Capitol. in Washington.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2255,2022-10-12 20:45:08

In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. Democratic senators are pushing for the U.S. to temporarily pause arms sales to Saudi Arabia after OPEC plus moved a slash oil production by two billion barrels a day. Experts say that could send gas prices higher around the world. Former Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says the Saudis don't deserve our help. We are selling highly sensitive advanced technology to a country that has aligned itself with an adversary, Russia, that is committing terrorist war crimes. Blumenthal says the Saudis need to restore trust with the U.S. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take. All right, Dan, thank you so much. We're going to give back to Herman Nareula, co-founder and CEO of Improbable and we're talking about his book Virtual Society. We'll get back to him in just a moment. In the meantime, we have an interesting story about Microsoft. Microsoft, yeah, the company is going to introduce an app to help employees and managers in a hybrid workplace to decide what's the right time to go into the office. This is a really interesting move for Microsoft because this is a company that has a really good connection with a lot of Fortune 500 companies to produce their products, right? Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, which allows you to work remotely, right? Exactly. So they can add a tool that essentially allows users to know when a large number of their co-workers are planning to be in the office or attending a meeting in person. It's the uberization of the world. All right, so the app, apparently this new Microsoft places Apple that users know when a large number of their co-workers plan to be in the office or attending a meeting in person. The app also shows when a work space is likely to be pretty empty to help managers make decisions about electricity, heating, and cooling that can save money. For example, as Europe looks to a winter or fuel and electricity shortages, which we just kind of talked about with our own Blueberg reporter, companies are seeking tools like this, Microsoft VP, Jared Spattaro, who's been a guest on our show. He said that in an interview. So one thing that I'm thinking about is the way that companies are deciding that everybody has to be in the office on certain days, right? You see it on the subway. Wednesday is definitely one of those days. On Wednesdays, the subway is absolutely packed. Same with my wife's company, right? She's actually going in on certain days and a lot of people work from home on Mondays and Fridays. So I don't know if you need necessarily that type of granular information. I guess. You know, if you know the days that people are going to be there, I understand it from a cost savings perspective when you're thinking about resources like electricity and heating. But it does seem like individual teams kind of have to get on the same page about the stuff ahead of time. I guess it's just, if a company chooses to work differently and maybe they want to scale down on their office space, so maybe this is a way of saying we can't have everybody in or I don't know if it's really hot. There's electricity surges or something like that. More of you work at home. I don't know. You use the AC at home, not at the office. Does it really matter? We're all going to be in the metaverse someday anyway. It's true. My avatar. That's all as long as I got legs. That's all I care. Let's go.

14032," which recently predicted that the metaverse will become an $800 billion industry by 2024. How should we be thinking though? Let's blow out the box. Let's just kind of go anywhere. Give us on an average day what the metaverse will mean for us. I think it's going to mean that a bunch of people have jobs as virtual performers, content creators, entertainers, service professionals inside virtual worlds. I think you're going to interact with communities, with celebrities, with education, inside rich virtual experiences. And I think for a lot of kids it's going to be more than just entertainment. It's going to be a kind of vital part of their social lives and all the way they interact with people. And it's kind of a growing up of video games, taking them from being just pure play entertainment to really connected, well. Is this a good thing, Herman? You know, it's like when you're a kid, your parents only let you watch a half hour TV a day or something or you can only play video games and tell you to go play outside, stuff like that. How do we think about this in the context of, you know, not actually socializing in real life? So I talk a lot about this in the book, you know, nobody's done a deep time on the psychology of economics, the social energy, which I try to do in virtual society. And talking to experts, the conclusion I've come to is that a friend you make online is still a friend, a job you have in virtual space, still a job, and an amazing adventure you go on in enrich your life doesn't have to be kind of in the quote unquote real well. And also frankly, a lot of our lives are on that real right now. I mean, if you've ever cried over your sports team or wondered how a rational stock market is, you know, our existence is already one of rich other realities. Metaverse is just the next phase in that evolution. Do you think metaverse, excuse me, meta is that the company that's going to set kind of the standard or the, you know, what we all follow in terms of the development and build out of the metaverse or not necessarily? I think perhaps not. I don't know that meta is going to be the sort of apple of the metaverse. I think they're right now on track to be more like the yaku of the metaverse. You know, the VR headset focus is a distraction from where real opportunity and value can become. And even if they're right about headsets, it's far from clear that that's going to be a premium high margin product. You know, I think most listeners here probably don't even know the maker of that. Television set, for example, yet we all have one. Whereas we do know the make of our phones. So I think there are a lot of lessons in the dot com boom. There are a lot of lessons in the history and evolution of the internet. I try to cover them in my book as well. So who ends up being the winner here? That's the cool thing. I don't think it's going to be one company. I think that we're going to see networks of cooperative businesses highly and tightly integrate it to create shared infrastructure using most likely web through your blockchain to share value. How does that happen? How does that happen though in an environment where you have huge venture capital firms that also see opportunity here. Bloomberg intelligence predicting what 800 billion dollars Carol venture capital. Well, they're going to want to go after that. Well, I'm putting my money on about this. We've raised hundreds of millions of venture capital this year and put it into a decentralized network called M square and the capitalist kept tokens. But the network actually builds worlds and those worlds become part of a shared, interoperable network where users can move from one world to another. So I think, of course, it'll attract investors. In actual fact, the real question here is how do we convince big brands, big companies to join the net of us? Are they going to want to join a centrally controlled platform where their revenues are below quality and they have no direct access to users? Are they savvy now? Because they want to own their own platforms. That's kind of my bet. I think big companies, brands, sports leagues, music, rights holders, they want to share a stake now. That's what's propelled my company to profitability. It's been these businesses wanting to own a share of the net of us rather than just be accustomed to something. You are profitable? Yeah. We recently announced that projecting profitability is. And I saw a story too about your close to another 100 million dollars in new funding. Is that true? Is there any update? Yeah, we are causing a new funding round led by an amazing company called Elron, which one of the pioneers in the blockchain space. And we're raising our 100 million dollars at a 3.3 billion dollar valuation, which is great to do an up-round in this planet. But let me ask you something, Herman. I mean, you guys initially were really into gaming, but you dropped that effort. Why the shift? Actually, we're a world leading provider of multi-platform expertise into over 60 different publishers. So we're quietly behind big shooter franchises. We built multi-plamode for guys. We've never shifted. It's just that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2258,2022-10-12 20:56:54
14033," leading provider of multiple expertise into over 60 different publishers. So we're quietly behind big shooter franchises. We built multiple emotive fall guys. We've never shifted. It's just that when it comes to the metaverse, which is based on interoperable, large scale, rich virtual experiences, the people who've been biting our hands off are not our traditional gaming customers who are happy with their siloed experiences. Big brands, its companies, its sports leagues. It's a new set of customers. That's taking our spice advice. That's what's propelled us so quickly to do the more revenue. Can I ask you something only because Mauricio who listens to Tim and I watches us on YouTube, he says, so is Twitter a metaverse? Is Twitter a metaverse or could it be a metaverse? Ooh, well, I would define a metaverse to network of meaning that exchanges value between multiple socially constructed realities. So to the extent that Twitter is another world, what happens in it isn't quite the real world and there's a value exchange between the real world and Twitter, I would say in a sense it isn't a metaverse. I mean, in a way Elon Musk is kind of like a pro wrestler playing a character on Twitter, creating value in this other world and it directly affects the real world. It's very, very interesting when you think of the value as a game. I think he's the boss of that metaverse. So I think he might be, he's not about to buy it. So you know what I'm going to go. Hey, Herman, what about when it comes to, you know, making money in the metaverse and you touched on this in the previous section of our interview in the context of, you know, getting more people into experiences, but I'm wondering if it's, you know, we hear about Decentral Land and the challenges that Decentral Land is facing and, you know, buying real estate in the metaverse and those sorts of things. At the end of the day, is it just going to be ads like in our Instagram feed? No, I think it's going to give us an entirety business model, which is also why it's going to be challenging for traditional companies like Meta who rely on ads to prosper. Video games don't make money primarily for ads. They make money from selling magic swords and customization options and cool things in the world. But the value of those things, like land, is proportional to the utility of them. And systems like Decentral Land are very primitive. They only handle like a couple of people in the world at one time. If you want valuable real estate, like think of prime not having real estate, it's got to be able to accommodate vast numbers of people. It's got to be central. It's got to have utility. And they're very hot technical challenges in enabling that kind of scale. That's the secret set of problems that need to be solved to enable the metaverse. And the number we like to think about is called operations per second. This is like the bandwidth of the net of us or the CPU power of the net of us, any particular world. And you need to be hitting billions of messages a second in order to be able to produce valuable worlds. And that's kind of what our company is working on. He can now handle over 30,000 people in one world. Herman, really quick, 15 seconds. If there's more company, you would tell our audience that they should keep an eye on in connection with metaverse beyond yours, what would it be real quickly? That's a really good question. I think Apple, I'm quite curious to see what that play in the space. All right, listen, really fun. I certainly blow in our mind a little bit on this Wednesday. Herman, Arula, co-founder and chief executive officer of improbable joining us via Zoom from London, his book, Virtual Society, The Metaverse and the new frontiers of human experience.

Plus, Andrew Yang joins us to talk about the state of tech entrepreneurship in a downturn. Plus, his outlook for president in 2024. All of that in a moment, but first let's get a look at the markets. We were so, so close yet so, so far. The Nasdaq 100 falling in the last five minutes of trading to carry on a horrid streak of losses. Bloomberg's ad Bloodlow has the movers and ad just last minute couldn't close the door. Yeah, they say it's the hope that kills you right. Look, we're down three tenths of a cent on S&P 500 just flat down less than a tenth of a percent on the Nasdaq 100. And that took into six straight days of losses. It's worse streaks since February of 2021. We're bracing for a CPI print on Thursday or inflation data for the month of September. And that will give us an indication of how much further the Fed will go with raising rates and how much more pain this market can take. Really interesting.

14035," the concern about slow down the end use cases for those semiconductors, yields did pull back a little bit this Wednesday. Intel has been a really interesting story of the last 24 hours. A Bloomberg scoop, you see the pain it suffered over the last six sessions. It rose slightly on Wednesday according to sources, Intel will lay off thousands of people. As soon as this month we can get an announcement in areas like sales and marketing where according to our sources they'll reduce head count by around 20%. No official comment from the company, however they have earnings on October 27th. That's something we're paying close attention to. So despite the headlines, the SP 500 falling to its lowest level since November 2020, there wasn't a lot of big movement when it came to tech. Netflix, up 3%, the kind of big outperform with no news behind it. But when you look at the mega caps, they were kind of muted, declines really, nothing really pulling in either direction and Twitter continues to basically trade sideways as we wait and see will this deal with Elon Musk close before October 28th. In the meantime, we're at around $0.50 a share. All right. That is the big question. Will the deal be sealed before that date? Thank you. Meantime this week's Bloomberg Business Week cover story focuses on the roller coaster ride that has been the Musk Twitter deal. Kurt Wagner writes that for Twitter, there are no good outcomes no matter what path a deal with Elon takes. Musk has publicly trashed Twitter's top management and alienated thousands of its employees vowed to slash rules that were put in place after misinformation, threatened election integrity and wants to make Twitter the everything out. But I don't really explain what that means here to discuss Bloomberg's Kurt Wagner. So the headline, Kurt, is that Twitter faces only bad outcomes if this deal closes. Why do you say so? Yeah. Well, remember, Emily, there's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and this stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash employees who have spent the last six to nine months just in this total state of uncertainty are going to have to pick up and pretend like nothing ever happened. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who for the last three months has been saying that Twitter has been lying about its user base and it doesn't have the right business model and all these things, right? So it's just sort of like it feels to me that there's not really a lot of good outcomes here. Now, I got a lot of fan mail after this story came today, Emily, for people who disagreed that they think, you know, the free speech kind of vision on Musk keeps talking about is going to make Twitter a much better place very shortly. But, you know, even that, I would probably argue is going to create a lot of other headaches for this platform very soon. Well, and look, Musk does have millions and millions of fans. So that's certainly not, you know, out of the question that, you know, some folks are going to be very happy if this deal gets done. That said, you use the words very shortly there. And I'm curious, say the deal does get done before October 28th. Could Elon Musk make significant changes to the platform before the midterm elections, before November 8th? I mean, the deal is supposed to close by the 28th, right? And so to me, that means that Elon Musk would be in charge and therefore could start making decisions around the market. Are they going to be able to, you know, bring President Trump back on the Twitter within the next week? Like, possibly it is possible, but how much of an impact is that going to have? I don't really know, right? But I do think that there could be changes to some of these policies. They could say, hey, all the folks who have been looking for misinformation or hate speech or voter misinformation, stand down. Don't bother, don't do your job. And all of a sudden, you know, we could have a very different level of content on the platform very soon. What's the latest on negotiations between the two parties? What are they actually talking about right now? Yeah, I mean, there has been some stuff that we have reported at Bloomberg that, you know, despite the fact that both sides want the same deal price, there have been some hangups, right? It is specifically that, you know, it sounds like Elon Musk wants to reserve his right to possibly sue some of these executives, want to deal closes to go after, you know, maybe people kind of personally as a way to say, hey, you've been misleading investors and misleading me, the potential buyer of this whole thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2261,2022-10-12 21:09:36
14036," the deal closes to go after maybe people kind of personally as a way to say, hey, you've been misleading investors and misleading me, the potential buyer this whole time, right? Twitter, of course, doesn't want to have that in there. They're also worried about the debt contingency that Elon has to add to the negotiations. So I imagine at this point, both sides are trying to iron through those types of details, right? I mean, they claim they want the same price. I think the debt is for the most part locked up. And so you think like, okay, they're really at the end here where they're kind of going over those very minute elements of a deal. All right, Kurt Wagner. Thanks for keeping us updated as always and check out that story in the latest edition of Bloomberg Business Week. All right, coming up just how big was this latest prime date or not? We're going to hear from the head of Amazon Prime next. This is Bloomberg. This week's Amazon Prime Flash Tale may not be all it's chalked up to be. Third-party researchers are saying the prime day sale is generating the same traffic as any regular day. Bloomberg said Ludlow asked Jamil Connie, Amazon's head of prime about the data. Here's how he responded. I don't know if that's the accurate read. We've been really impressed with how many prime members are showing up, how they're engaging with the event and how they're shopping. They're shopping the entire store. Some of the favorite categories so far are electronics, toys, home, apparel, health and personal care, top brands like Apple, Laneige, HP, Shark, and many, many others, including items off our curated top 100 list. So we've been really, really happy with the events so far. Our members can engage through midnight tonight so I encourage them to check it out. What is Amazon tracking to do for this October window in dollar terms relative to July? Can you give us some granularity about the impacts of having a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2262,2022-10-12 21:13:39
14037," What is Amazon tracking to do for this October window in dollar turns relative to July? Can you give us some granularity about the impacts of having a second window in the same calendar year? Yeah, we have to keep in mind that prime day this year was the largest prime day we've ever had 1.7 billion dollars in savings for our members around the globe And so what we're trying to do with this event is give our prime members yet another opportunity to save We know that our members are always looking for savings But no more so than now where you know the macro economic economic environment Has everybody trying to make the dollar stretch a little bit further? And so this is an opportunity for 48 hours for our members to get an exclusive jump on their holiday shopping It's needs and wants across the entire store and so far the engagement's been really strong So it's too early to tell But I expect that there will be deals throughout the event that's something that we learned in prime day that our members Like top brands and they like having deals throughout the entire event You're going to continue to see that through midnight tonight. So this window will not be as big as the July window It's too early to tell but we're very excited by the early engagement And it is the kickoff to the entire holiday season We're going to have deals and discounts throughout the entire period Black Friday Cyber Monday Continued to be incredibly important But we want to take care of our most engaged or most important customers first Those are our prime members and so this is the kickoff to the season that is interesting right the idea around the pool forward In holiday spending can you tell us maybe about how that might help clear out some inventories ahead of the holiday season Yeah, you know this event is not about inventory this we built this event purpose built on the top brands that are Members we know are looking for as they go into the shopping season And so this is an exclusive 48 hours for our prime members to get a jump on their holiday shopping Ensure that they get those must-have giftable items Get some of the holiday rush out of the way earlier in the season But we're going to continue the deals and discounts for all of our customers including prime members Going into black Friday and cyber Monday You alluded to it earlier, but what are you learning about the consumer on based on what they're buying? It seems through third party data They might be going for the sort of cheaper end of the spectrum in terms of the items they're buying is there any sense that the consumer is feeling the pain of inflation? Well, I think all of us as americans are feeling the pinch of inflation All of us want to stretch our dollar as far as we can what we saw in prime day is that members engaged across all All sales prices from consumables and everyday essentials all the way up through that electronic devices It's needs through wants and that's why we built prime early access sale to have the top brands across the entire store So that members can meet those needs and wants We've got top brands in health and personal care all the way to toys to home apparel and electronics Which are you know up clearly a member favor every holiday season and so we're seeing the same in engagement Now we expect that to continue over the next several hours through midnight tonight Amazon's head of prime there Jamil ghani with our own ad load load for more on this I want to bring in our Bloomberg reporter Spencer Sober who of course covers Amazon so Spencer Let's talk about Potential disparity here in what the third party folks are saying and what Amazon is saying just how good has this prime day actually been so far Yeah, I think it's uh What we're hearing is that there's you know slight lift from a usual day now We're getting some revised data from what we had earlier, you know some uh, you know a deeper look Slight lift from from a typical day, but not nearly the same amount of lift as they had in the summer prime day And I'm not sure that we're that far off. I mean if you listen carefully to what the Amazon executive says it uses words like Shop and he uses words like engagement and so he doesn't use words like buy and he doesn't use words like spend You know, so so engagement can be just a cute way to say people yeah people are coming on the site They're noodling around they're looking at this that and the other but they're not really buying a whole lot So what does this tell us about the state of the consumer potentially more",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2263,2022-10-12 21:18:11
14038," They're noodlein' around, they're lookin' at this that and the other, but they're not really buying a whole lot. So what does this tell us about the state of the consumer, potentially more broadly, leading into the holidays, or does it tell us something more about Amazon? Well, I think it's a little of both, right? I mean, it's not a secret that consumers are pulling back, that they're dealing with higher food and fuel prices, things that they have to buy and have less money, you know, to spend on things that they want to buy. And then on Amazon, we're learning like, on these kind of things, some of the top categories are like household essentials and pantry items and things. People just kind of spendin' to stock up on things that they otherwise buy and not necessarily splurging on things like electronics and whatnot. But then in terms of Amazon, it's just they figured, hey, what the heck we'll do another sale. And it was interesting, you said it, it wasn't about inventory. When it is about inventory, that's really why Amazon was able to spin this thing up so quickly is because a lot of merchants, you know, the inventory's already there. They have. Meantime, there've been some developments in unionization efforts at an Amazon warehouse in California. What's the latest on that? Yeah, this is pretty interesting to watch. So there's a one warehouse in Marino Valley and the Inland Empire. And that's a real stronghold for Amazon. That's probably where they've got the most concentrated number of facilities and employees. And so one of them just submitted signatures to push for a union election affiliated with this Amazon labor union, which was the one that, you know, won approval for a union in Staten Island, which Amazon is still contesting. And now there's another vote coming up next week in Albany, again, affiliated with this Amazon labor union. So starting to look like this thing's spreading and Amazon's having a hard time containing it. All right, Spencer Soaper, who covers Amazon for us. Thank you. Coming up, weeks after the massive Adobe Figma deal, the other hot enterprise software startup has some news. Eric Tables, CEO, Howie Lou is with us next. This is Bloomberg.<|iw|><|translate|> The collaboration software startup AirTable just announced its biggest launch of the year at its inaugural AirTable Leaders Forum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2264,2022-10-12 21:23:03
14039," The collaboration software startup AirTable just announced its biggest launch of the year at its inaugural AirTable Leaders Forum coming up with a new connected apps platform that will help companies like Netflix, LinkedIn and iHeart Media, share data, manage workflows, track product roadmaps and more co-founder and CEO, Howie Liu with me now for more on this. So talk to us about the trends that you're seeing in Enterprise Software and why an announcement like this in your mind is important. Like what problems does this solve? Yeah, I mean I think it's best to explain it in terms of where we came from and where we're going. So 10 years ago, Mark and Drieson said software is eating the world. We created AirTable really to kind of execute against that and empower the teams closest to the work in every company to be part of that disruption, to build the apps for themselves that they needed. Now we've seen this bigger problem within Enterprise's where it's not enough to just have individual apps, but those apps need to be connected and to allow the entire enterprise to all share a source of truth while enabling all those individual teams to still be really, really flexible and agile. So it's kind of the next frontier of AirTable, you know, combining what we've already done literally in these connected apps across an enterprise. AirTable benefited from some of those pandemic tailwinds, the shift to hybrid work, has that kept up? What sort of workplace trends are you seeing now? I think a lot of what we're seeing now is that there is this huge need to rethink how work is being done, right? Especially in today's economy, it's not just about throwing more people at every problem. You can't just, you know, double your headcount in every department to get more output. You need to rethink how efficiently you work. And that's where I think our enterprise vision of connected apps is really going to come into play and it's already showing up in how we sell AirTable, how we're seeing our customers adopt AirTable. It's really about enabling more agility and more output. You know, we talked about this customer case study during our event earlier today of equinox actually accelerating their content production efforts by 400% with the same team and during a pandemic where they were all working from home, nonetheless using AirTable and connected apps. How do you see competition shaping up? There's a sauna Monday.com, others that are vying to be the project management tool of choice. What is AirTable's advantage? Yeah, I think the whole idea behind declaring our North Star as connected apps is that we're actually elevating ourselves out of that world of project management. We actually don't really care as much about the task management small team use cases that I think a lot of the other products are going after. And instead, we're really trying to solve this bigger problem across an entire enterprise where you need these shared sources of truth, these high valued golden data sets as we call them, you know, for instance, Netflix having this master list of all the content titles they're producing and then wanting to manage all of their marketing, their post production, their legal rights management, etc. workflows across that data set. And so it's really us going out and taking on more companies like ServiceNow or even Salesforce with their app cloud efforts when we think about going and deploying apps across every other part of the enterprise, not just doing projects or tasks. I think some people are still recovering from the shock of the big Adobe Figma deal. $20 billion and I'm just dying to hear your thoughts on it. Given that air table is one of the few, you know, a hot enterprise software startups that's often mentioned in the same breath as Figma. What's your take on this deal? I think Figma is an incredible product company has a great team. You know, they started around the same time as us. So weirdly, we've been parallel. I think we both started around 2012. Both spent years building a pretty technically interesting product before launching these were not products air table nor Figma that were built overnight as a hack project, but really a deliberate taking on of a really, really large market opportunity. I think ultimately the trend that's really benefited both of us is that for the first time on the web when both of us started, you could build these really rich desktop great experiences, right? Figma could not have been built. You couldn't build that level of experience in the web, nor could you build air table in the web. And so I think we're both right place, right time to take on really large market opportunities. And disrupting some incumbents as a result. Is getting acquired like that something that's attractive to you? Are you on the IPO path instead?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2265,2022-10-12 21:27:01
14040," Active to you, are you on the IPO path instead? I think that the best companies have to think about how to build an independent business, right? I mean, when you look at Figma, one of the reasons why it was so attractive as a business and why it's valued so much in this deal is because actually they could go to a loan. They have the leverage, I mean, it's growing very quickly. It's an amazing business. There's a massive tam and it's truly a disruptive and delightful product, right? And so I think if you can go out and build a company that is truly capable of being a star in a star independent business on the IPO path, then I think that also raises your attractiveness in this case for Figma through an M&A deal. So we've always been squarely focused on just building the best product and ultimately business and company that we can and we're not optimizing for an acquisition. So we've seen valuations of tech startups fall across the board. You raised at an almost $12 billion valuation at the end of last year. Does that number hold up in a downturn or is air table in the rare category of startups like Figma, potentially where that number potentially goes up? So the way I've always thought about it is the short-term valuation is just it's a point in time and what really matters for both us as team members working on this company for shareholders who may consider investing in our table is what is the long-term expected value of this business? And especially since we're private and we don't have a public liquid value right now, what do we think this company will be worth in one year, two year, three years? And especially as the operators within the business, what can we do to drive towards the best possible result? And so I think as we push into connected apps and this bigger and bigger possibility of solving a problem for enterprises at large, actually generating multi-million dollar contracts repeatedly, and even driving up our already best-in-class net dollar retention, I think we feel very good about the clear path that we can get to building a really extraordinary business that's highly differentiated as the unit economics to support a really freemium multiple. And whether there's overall multiple compression in the public markets in the near term, I think the great businesses that ultimately go after really large tams and have durable growth potential can outgrow any of that compression because they just keep growing and growing. All right, interesting, interesting response there, air table co-founder and CEO, how we look, good to have you back here on the show. Thank you for stopping by. Come on up, our conversation with former presidential Canada and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang, his outlook on how startups and venture survive in a downturn, crypto, tech regulation and more coming up next. And later in the show, GraySkills, Michael Saunin-Shine joins us to talk about the company's legal challenge with the SEC over a $12 billion ETF.

The global sell-off in semiconductor shares continues, but one name in Japan. Bucking that trend are a little back with a look at social next. Ed? Yeah, we don't often talk about Japan, but let's look at social next in the context of this big sell-off we've seen in global chip stocks. It had its trading debut in Japan in Tokyo on Wednesday, jumping 15 percent, a lot of investor interest here, generating around 67 billion yen or $456 million of proceeds. And what's so interesting about this name, it's a maker of systems on a chip or logic processes for one of a better description, is there's a lot of appetite right now for what it's offering in a market where we have a lot of questions about global chip demand. If we bring up the next chart, this was actually the biggest IPO in Japan so far this year on a gross proceeds generated basis. It was the four five PO for a chip maker out of Japan this year. So it's really interesting to see that name, Buck the Trend. We're also getting data points out of Vander this Wednesday, they actually see retail investors taking a keen interest in the chip space, even if we see institutional money kind of sitting on the sidelines or pulling out because we have concerns about a global slowdown. And speaking about those concerns, we look at this terminal chart, investors are really pulling back earnings expectations for the chip sector. We've had bad news from a broad range of names. We're concerned about a slowdown in demand for consumer electronics for memory chips in particular and the PC market that scoop overnight from Bloomberg that Intel, according to sources, is going to cut thousands of jobs because of the PC slowdown. Well, this is the result, the market pulling back its expectations. But one name in Japan, so see our next, as we said, em, Bucking that trend. All right, Ed, thank you. A name we don't normally hear about. Appreciate it. I want to zoom out now of chip stocks and get back to the broader macro environment with rising inflation and a falling market, the state evaluations, adventure capital and startup innovation, all top of mind at the Greenwich Economic Forum. That is underway right now. Our next guest entrepreneur and former presidential candidate, Andrew Yang, joins us from there now. Andrew, obviously so much talk about what is going to happen with this economy. Are we or are we not going into a recession? Given your venture for America background, I'm curious what your outlook is if you are an entrepreneur, trying to get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2267,2022-10-12 21:36:29
14042," into a recession. Given your venture for America background, I'm curious what your outlook is. If you are an entrepreneur, trying to get started in a downturn. Well, if you look at the track record of high growth companies, Emily, and you know this full well, most of the really meaningful companies get started in a downturn like this one for a host of reasons. The fact is that an enterprise that succeeds in this time is going to be poised to really mushroom as soon as the climate starts turning more positive. So I do think that this is going to be a very, very tough time, but guaranteed we're going to see tons of meaningful firms come out of this period. What's your sense of how this tough time will compare to, let's say the financial crisis or even the dot-com bust? Is there something different about it? No, I think we have a ways to go on the down slope myself. And we can all see very clearly that the Fed's going to be checking up interest rates for the foreseeable. And there are a lot of valuations that don't make as much sense in that environment. So we're going to all find out together how this compares to some of the tough times of the past. But I certainly think that folks should try and keep some powder dry. Make sure that you have enough cash to make it through for a little bit longer than you might hope. San Francisco is one city that's having a tough time recovering from the pandemic and now there's this downturn. You've got companies going remote. You've got companies moving to Austin or Miami. Do you think the center of innovation, the fundamental center of gravity is actually going to shift and become more distributed or is it too early to say that? No, you and I both have friends who have decamped to Austin or Miami. And I'm a big believer that innovation and growth will follow wherever the talent goes. So if you have people who have permanently settled in Austin, I think you're going to see a permanent shift truly. Now the Bay Area, in my view, still has the highest concentration of tech talent. So it's still going to be the envy of many other cities. But I do think we're in a permanently different time where talent is going to be more distributed and because of that, you're going to see capital be more distributed and growth companies come out of places where they might not have otherwise. Congress has been trying to rein in big tech and big tech has retaliated by spending a ton of money to kill one of the most aggressive oversight bills in years. What's your thought on whether that bill potentially needs to be revived and whether strong regulation is really needed? Oh, it's interesting, Emily, the political climate has changed such that tech now is a bit of a punching bag for both parties. And I'm of the belief that there have been some excesses that regulation would be appropriate for. And a lot is going to hinge upon what the political climate is after these midterms. Right now, the Senate is a toss up by most accounts. Republicans are slightly favored in the House. And I think that might change the prospects of some of the bills that we're talking about. You've been very vocal about data collection. You launched the data dividend products to help Americans take control of your data. How are you feeling about how tech companies are handling that data right now and especially going into an election? You know, it's fascinating, Emily, as you know, I championed the CPRA and data privacy regulations in California where you are. And because California has now set a higher bar, national legislation is increasingly likely and on the table in part because tech companies wanted to supplant and replace the rules in California. Our data is being used not to our benefit. It's a $200 billion plus a year industry. It's eroding our democracy, our kids mental health. And so.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2268,2022-10-12 21:40:00
14043," Not to our benefit. It's a $200 billion plus a year industry. It's eroding our democracy, our kids' mental health. So I'm someone who thinks that we should own our data and not only have it used more to our benefit, but if there is going to be market value gained, we should join in that benefit. So that's where I'd like the national approach to go. Europe has new rules that are coming online in 2024, which is right around the corner. And I think that's going to increase pressure on the states to have a more modernized approach. You've been branching out into crypto and Web 3, and I'm curious what role or how much of a role you think crypto will play in fundraising going into 2024. And if you think Democrats or Republicans have more of an advantage. Now I think the single biggest donor in the last cycle was Sam Bankman Freedom. You all probably know well. So Web 3, in my view, is going to be a very fascinating, clinical force to be reckoned with. Right now, they're concerned obviously, largely with the regulation of crypto itself. But I think that you're going to see more people pushing into politics because now the interaction with DC is going to be one of the main drivers of whether enterprises are able to grow and operate successfully anywhere, but certainly whether they're going to be headquartered here in the U.S. You also launched Lobby 3 earlier this year. I'm so curious how many people have bought into the tokens and what positions is Lobby 3 going to be advocating for? Lobby 3 has been a great energized community of people that want to push for common sense regulation out of DC that is intelligent and sophisticated and doesn't try and throw different types of assets together that has one regulator instead of kind of a Hodgepodge. And it's been awesome getting to know people who want the best things for creators and entrepreneurs in the space. Any time I go to a Web 3 gathering, there are some folks who are part of the Lobby 3 community and it's been a lot of fun. As a former presidential candidate and the co-chair now of the Forward Party, I'd love to see into your crystal ball. Do you think Abiden Trump faced off in 2024? Is that inevitable? It's the most likely match up right now, Emily. The odds are that Trump declares at the end of this year after the midterms and then Biden declares either Q1 or Q2 of next year. I will say that those two candidates will have a combined age of 159 in 2024 and 58% of Americans are not excited about either of them. So the question is whether a unity ticket or some independent effort arises and a group called No Labels is very publicly invested $53 million in ballot access for a potential unity ticket. I think there's going to be a lot of enthusiasm for some alternative after people face the reality that it is a rematch in 2024 between Trump and Biden. So let's say Biden doesn't run. Do you think the Democrats have a strong enough bench? Who's on that bench? Would you consider running again? I think Joe Biden likely declares because he feels he's the only one who can defeat Donald Trump because he did it once. And you can't argue with the fact that he did defeat Trump once. But it's also tough to slot in another Democrat who you have the same confidence in necessarily if you're Joe or even if you're anyone because right now it's unclear who the Democratic nominee would be. I think that's one reason why Joe is going to run again honestly. So how are you going to spend the next couple of years? If you're not running again, where are we going to see you place your energy and efforts and priorities given a very critical election coming up? So the forward party has endorsed a number of candidates around the country, including a US Senate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2269,2022-10-12 21:43:58
14044," is given a very critical election coming up. So the forward party has endorsed a number of candidates around the country, including a US Senate candidate, named Evan McMullan, whom I'm going out to campaign in Utah for this weekend. We think we need to change the underlying incentives for our lawmakers and leaders by doing away with closed party primaries and replacing them with primaries where anyone could go for anyone through something called rank choice voting. If there's one thing you remember from this interview out there, if you're, you know, jelly not that into politics, rank choice voting is the way out of this mess. It's a way that anyone could vote for anyone with no spoiler effect, and it rewards more moderate, reasonable, collaborative candidates who actually come through for 51% of voters. So I'm going to be trying to make rank choice voting the law in as many places as possible. And I'm happy to say it's spreading around the country. All right, Andrew Yang, always great to have you with us, entrepreneur, obviously a former presidential candidate, co-chair of the Forward Party. Thank you, Andrew, for stopping by. Coming up, the latest salvo comes from Grayscale versus the FCC. Grayscale CEO joining us next to talk about the case for a Bitcoin ETF. This is Bloomberg. Thanks a lot, again.................",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2270,2022-10-12 21:48:54
14045," Give us the latest. Where does the lawsuit with the SEC stand at this moment? Well, last night at Emily, we filed our opening brief for the lawsuit. So this lays out our initial legal arguments to the court, and it's really the first substantive document as part of the litigation process. So it's important to remember this is a case about Bitcoin, but we're putting in front of our, you know, in front of the court system really straight forward common sense arguments. I think one of the new arguments that's laid out here has to do with this idea of a significant market test, which the SEC has applied to Bitcoin ETF applications. They've applied this very stringently to spot Bitcoin ETF applications like grayscale and other spot-pick-win ETFs that have been denied, but very leniently to Bitcoin futures ETF applications, which is why we have several of them in the market. And there's really been no justification as to why this test is the, in fact, only test that the SEC should be using, and we've also never seen them use a test like this before when it comes to evaluating new products to bring to market. Have you spoken at all with Gary Gensler directly? You know, we have regular dialogue with really everyone in DC, my legal team and myself are down in DC almost weekly these days. So we speak with all different parts of the SEC and other regulators. Now, look, recently there have been a ton of cases, fraud and bankruptcy in crypto, there's Terra, there's Celsius, there's three hours. Why is now the right time to prove to the SEC that this market is no worse in terms of market manipulation than others? Well, that's exactly the point. This significant market test that the SEC has laid out, they believe protects investors from fraud and manipulation, and they got comfortable with that when it comes to Bitcoin futures. Well, the interesting thing and the flaw in that logic is that Bitcoin futures derived their pricing from the underlying spot Bitcoin market, which underpins GBTC and any other spot Bitcoin ETF application that's become, you know, in front of the SEC and ultimately been rejected or denied. I think what we're seeing though in DC is probably the most engagement and understanding we've ever seen around crypto. You've bipartisan support now with a variety of bills passing across the floor of Congress. And I think we in other industry, you know, heavy weights are calling on our regulators, calling on our legislators to really develop new frameworks because otherwise we're squandering innovation here in the United States. The Winkle Voss brothers were the first to try this spot Bitcoin ETF, it didn't fail. The road is littered with carcasses of others who've tried and failed. How is grayscale with its huge scale in your view? Different. It's a great question, Emily. So today, grayscale Bitcoin trust, ticker GBTC, is the largest Bitcoin fund in the world. It owns over 3% of all Bitcoin outstanding. A recent count said that there are more than 850,000 investors who own shares of GBTC in the US alone. And that represents all 50 states. So when we as an asset manager are taking a product that's been in the market has billions of dollars of assets, hundreds of millions of dollars of daily trading volume, has voluntarily become an SEC reporting company. And we know that the right thing for investors to protect them, to put additional disclosures and surveillance in place by becoming an ETF is the right thing for them. But our regulator is really shunning the opportunity to do so. Well, we certainly take issue with that. And so our team has been putting the entire resources of the firm behind this ETF initiative. And we're as committed as we've ever been to it. What kind of timeline do you see for a resolution of this case? Well, we filed the lawsuit earlier this summer. And at that time, we were guided to believe it could be anywhere from nine to 12 months, although it could be longer, could be shorter. What you're going to see now that grayscale has filed, its opening brief is over the coming weeks, you'll see a variety of amicus briefs. So these are other parties that are filing briefs with the court to put in front of the judges presiding over the case to really talk about their points of view on the issues at hand. And then ultimately, you'll see a brief from the SEC a couple of weeks later with their responses to the arguments that our legal team has outlined.

We're also, you know, in the middle of what could be a really massive economic downturn, we just heard from Andrew Yang who said he thinks we've got a lot further downward to go. What is your outlook and what it means for crypto? We're certainly in a crypto winter. And a crypto winter is characterized now by sustained lower prices. We're seeing from the investment community though that the lower prices are not causing them to shy away from the asset class. In fact, we're actually seeing investors continue to diversify. So a lot of investors now kind of have that core position in Bitcoin, core position in Ethereum or both. And they're not looking at other opportunities. And one of them is actually infrastructure. Just last week our team launched a totally new offering, grayscale digital infrastructure opportunities LLC, which is an operating company that investors can put capital to work in. That's actually buying Bitcoin mining hardware, plugging it into the network and distributing that value back out to shareholders. So for a lot of investors, they've had that token exposure now. And now it's time that they think about the underlying infrastructure that secures the network. And so there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of activity going on despite the sustained lower pricing environment. We find ourselves in. Speaking of the underlying infrastructure, the Ethereum merge ended up being kind of a non event. What do you think the next big event is going to be, you know, that will, you know, catalyze changes and potentially blockchain technology? You know, Emily, respectfully as someone who's been in crypto for nine years, it actually was a big event because this was a question mark hanging over Ethereum for a long time. Could we see a very well known, very well trafficked, very well utilized digital asset protocol move and make such a meaningful move from proof of work to proof of stake and Ethereum did it. Now, I think as we're seeing the outcome of that, it's very, very early days and we're starting to see the development of more and more staking around Ethereum and other assets. What's coming next is other upgrades to the Ethereum network, things like the ability to unstake assets that are put into the network for staking and other upgrades that will come down the line. But I certainly think it's going to accomplish men for all the developers and everyone who really put a lot of time and many, many years of planning and energy into getting Ethereum to make the switch over. All right, point taken, Michael Sondenshin, Grace Kale, CEO, we're going to continue to follow your challenge to the SEC. Appreciate you stopping by.

The reason given the store needs to negotiate the perks with Apple via their collective bargaining arrangement.

SpaceX plans to announce two new space tourists slated to fly on the Starship rocket. Dennis Tito, the world's first ever space tourist in 2001 and his wife, the couple paid an undisclosed amount to fly around the moon on Starship once the vehicle is complete. They will travel with ten other undisclosed passengers on a roughly week long journey. The trip doesn't include a landing on the lunar surface and it's unclear if the other passengers have been chosen yet. And that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology.

14048," Original The great sci-fi art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travels seem like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half-century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station, 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system, New Shepard, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2274,2022-10-12 22:06:00
14049," Orgital Tourism, aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are a whole other level of complexity, energy, and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Vom Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there, and you go basically straight up and straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved, or much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up, and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives, and backgrounds, and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space, because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side. And so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project, called AxStation, will become the first free-flying private international space station. Or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Iglo Aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2275,2022-10-12 22:10:26
14050," once in a orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that inflatable sort of lighter. You can just blow them up and then they get a nice big size for about half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not an attorney for any of the space tours so I haven't been privy to their private contracts but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of that I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wave. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities, it doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong. So let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued. So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well, boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the way it lead the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space here. We don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's kind of all around this and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes who gets the oxygen first. And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth. So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. But they don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. Things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2276,2022-10-12 22:14:34
14051," and other things that you can do with microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good, when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's gonna be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-articles space. When it becomes more like buying a first class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? The goal is to get to the point where it's not $10 million or $300 million or $300 million or $300 million or $300 million. Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself selling large quantities of their stock in the company. And absolutely Shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings traveling to space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution and how we treat our planet and what we've been doing. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up.

All very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. It's a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's do it. I'll show you. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we had a cab, but we got here lay last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM Land on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. You know. Do you think about California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. He's a 2019 Ford Ranger, has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet, but just a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA and then just roll out when you want it. It's my daily driver, handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need, think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box, stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. This awning. It's phenomenal. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. We just pop that up. Sort of. So home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man.

For some reason, it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation room somebody, or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos. And we all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Take that apocalypse. time. The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. When we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Uh yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got out of the smoke.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2279,2022-10-12 22:28:39
14054," Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got out of the smoke. Whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast-forward four hours or so, and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of Yosemite for the smoky... Look at it. Stripmalls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're to wear here and this near Fresno, this is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg. So we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans......feel a little bit of the background of God's. You know, some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back away. Tell me kind of like how we got......so it was essentially like a startup, I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. I'm just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed. And this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this labor point, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor, I think, like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen, they can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying an orchard. And so, that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So, it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So, if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, so you can see in the background. So, every new machine as it comes off the assembly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2280,2022-10-12 22:31:39

As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle Works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ellie Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that cannot make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Lily Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.A.Q. Tell me what the weather is today.

Until recently, robots were mostly in factories, separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of LEQ, from the way LEQ moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces. Like that they saw their feedback, turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. LEQ, tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artifact is a very large computer. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. LQ? Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? I'm getting a little bit more to learn from people, connect to a robot. And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We, as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. Taking away from Danielle gave her so much more because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the kids' classes, she fought for it, and she got into it, and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now, and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2282,2022-10-12 22:43:11
14057," She's been working in the field for four years now, and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where I'll be like a circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. Hello, are you? I'm fine. Thank you. Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now, the Q, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. I know source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship for human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So, don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2283,2022-10-12 22:47:07
14058," In other words it has only changed their style and it's been really awesome. percent of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vlogger's latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. Here I am, here I am, how do you do? But often it involves toys and for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised, unquestionably, the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children this first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes, great as tall you ever been. And his name is Mr. Machines. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2284,2022-10-12 22:51:41
14059," It's really promotion for our prop of your IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes, and now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years, and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that Toy started to become designed for a 32nd commercial. Closed at some mild amount of toolbox, open at some micro-machine USA. Cruiser mini-micro-machine vehicles, planes and posts to the police station, the marine of the mini-moderate cycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, the real working driver, a highway passenger, rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 32nd commercial, cost-reduced it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. Fire, boom, that man! See ya, that man. That man's turbo-powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business, just grown a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what with the time was going to be a mature, generated content, like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks to just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, lazy Sunday, if you remember that, SNL short. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The Trude is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, which is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech, which was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2285,2022-10-12 22:56:00
14060," fairly successful pretty early on on the platform and you know you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013 which on this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them hands channels. Okay and a hands channel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners and it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this home-new format and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stuck, that was hard to miss and you would see it in the data and we had access to a lot of data at Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube who I consider the first child so to speak unboxing star and they would open toys and kids were just mesmerized by it. They loved watching it and next thing you know you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy you know it was and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, see the piece by piece. Yeah he's in a bathroom, we're in a he's eating a lobster. You know the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were you know from a doll's perspective just terrible. I mean they were 10 minutes long, they were boring, it was a shaky camera, there was absolutely no production value and if you think about these executives you know they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience and they're brought these videos and say we'll look at this video, it has 200,000 views on it and it's terrible. When I first heard of it I thought it was the weirdest thing and just seemed kind of bizarre who would want to watch someone opening a toy taking it out of the box. But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense and I think that I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise! LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play which is you know basically the most popular play pattern there is collectible so within each LOL surprise you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect and then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting, it was a blind pack as they call it and LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then you know 2016 they were a small player in the toy industry founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that oh you're old you don't know anything about what's happening in today's thing and I said like what and they said for example there is do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views so I thought they're pulling my leg children to to make fun of their parents and then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you why would anybody buy an iPhone take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody can go and watch it so I typed toy on unboxing and my god I saw so many different videos and people kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it so that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. All right oh yes we've got a goal ball. Frole... hello, well",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2286,2022-10-12 23:00:47
14061," And that's the first LOL surprise. All right. Oh, yes, we've got a goal ball. LOL changed the way you open with toys. And everybody saw that. And the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package, you take the toy out. That's not exciting. You open up LOL. You peel it away. You open up inside. You have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became, you know, the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. The LOL was bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marvel. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to, you know, figure out what Marvel are. Our star wars is. And LOL eclips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards. We open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Bligar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchemals. Woo! Woo! But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, except the conflict, you're going to stop your advertising of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise that Nickelodeon could have been a death nap. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to, they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom, both in L.A. federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court, defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So dad buy himself forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl Sing. Good morning, Chocolatey Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2287,2022-10-12 23:04:34
14062," Fancy! They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL Surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's a lot of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV, which was about 90% of their ad spend. And then traditional PR, get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now. Because the formula is so complicated, you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents, and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video, or there's some other compensation. And that lures the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers, and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started charging for their services as they started building a following. Now because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. The content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you had toys like GI Joe turn into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now. So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2288,2022-10-12 23:09:02
14063," in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or Not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior, and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big giant global brands, and that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year, and there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kid naffings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation, and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team, and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2289,2022-10-12 23:13:20
14064," Airbnb is a start-up that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things. And it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast, that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night was past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests, and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at ADIA-BMB, and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name. But by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of measures. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment, hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2290,2022-10-12 23:17:42
14065," There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City, where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or counselling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story and they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. And, you know, Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation, where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And, what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2291,2022-10-12 23:21:51
14066," And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your VMV's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. AirBMB's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of AirBMB, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, AirBMB's entire business model is under three. It sounds far-fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the map to distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds' unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be hit for us for the final cent of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupala. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The over-arching achievement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2292,2022-10-12 23:26:16
14067," Food Research Laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture, and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research. It's educated us about how to live. It's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favourite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, Destiny Hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-rether orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. The federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities, the iPhones, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that will be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. With Bi-Aformer ISS Program Manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost-operated on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not a me-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2293,2022-10-12 23:30:36
14068," Being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail. But over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one-fiftyth, the cost of the ISS. I mean, when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. And that's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support. And we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbed it and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station. And others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2294,2022-10-12 23:35:05
14069," Realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers. It might be in service of government mission objectives. It will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen. And it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime. And I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A four-story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot, which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart, which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg, it's very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape, as well as a nested shell structure, also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments, which is very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space. And finding solutions for how to build or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on a moon, and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX, who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hoped their technology could be monetized, as well as transformational, here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology, which we can now apply on Earth, to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured very inner-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2295,2022-10-12 23:39:21
14070," We kind of make this jump in construction technology, which we can now apply on Earth, to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Center's historic head 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small, but the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home, so we help up our cells out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space and industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But the four lower thawbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back 2-3 weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have 2-3 days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much, folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down.

14071," You've heard this trope before. Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing. Compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now, this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now, millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So, you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AME area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like Circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Getting a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-Low Photos, that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, including eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people.

14072," and she'll upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients texts me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved. These days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth. And the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small instead. Instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. Find me folks like Brandon Rool and Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying with a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIYing the entire closet.

14073," A greenhouse! I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her Fixer Upper Site on Scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself, project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. We're going to need young families. Look at these products. They'll look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey. They can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home that's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram and they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So, while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. Like technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism.
