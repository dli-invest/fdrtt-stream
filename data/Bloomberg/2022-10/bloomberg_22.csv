16691," Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally French in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent, all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken to two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right laborer in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice when my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood, I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes or blow. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner he'd been friends with, Lorenzo Fertida and his brother Frank Fertida, UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It's all over! It is all over! The Abo Sanchez, is the Ultimate Fighter! UFC, under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry. People throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. They set us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, Hey, we realized that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this. UFC Family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5037,2022-10-21 00:01:21
16692," unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters, and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on this order of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zoofa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off two of its competitors is the fighters themselves.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5038,2022-10-21 00:05:38
16693," by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. They made it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole Mixed Partial Arts world. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case to this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional Mixed Martial Arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kungli, Nekori and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jrasson came to me and says, hey, come, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed antitrust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to describe having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something I've had a challenge in admitting, I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to her mom's the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bar tender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt. Come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5039,2022-10-21 00:09:58
16694," Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up. You find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Rani Gattour. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release this from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. You know, we're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we're every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. People tell fighters, you know, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made. You",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5040,2022-10-21 00:14:13
16695," When they're just moving around the ocean, do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in. And it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since Seba 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate. Then if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcaw is an 82 meter long research vessel. Equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to Sonar acoustics that is, I call it math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor. And that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate sea bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 meter mark and it's 4.6 degrees C and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it and so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now it's below this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5101,2022-10-21 00:22:56
16696," So you get that sort of high resolution picture. You don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology. But it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. And it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide, as with huge incites, as we go out into space as well and look for life in other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the wild population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm baked to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken meat. Looks pretty crispy outside. That's really good. I mean, look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5102,2022-10-21 00:27:21
16697," It's the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, culture chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just, the company behind these chicken nuggets style dishes is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cats. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. We bring animals in tiny little spaces that accelerate the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we certainly need, if you will, an end game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Post earlier in 2011. And essentially it was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, being mercy cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply, to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. You just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk cheese.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5103,2022-10-21 00:31:39
16698," meets our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust has developed chicken nuggets so far, with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup, Memphis Meats, has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we've got a lot of beef and chicken. We show that we at Memphis Meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need, and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate, and it's very similar for us as well. Working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years, and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand, and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues. Now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest into allowing the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed, raises, or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves those are the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So of course, in the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that will lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chickens eat. I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually. And there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sarah Debrin, Richard Branson, and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this destructive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat and eat it. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. It's never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that, and we're going to figure out how to feed the next 3 billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really helpful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5104,2022-10-21 00:35:57
16699," that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in, we can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are, and that makes me really hopeful. In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible stated goal really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the impossible burger. It's called artificial meat, the realest, the biggest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astanctus my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flanchulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Heme, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So heme is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat sodium.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5105,2022-10-21 00:40:23
16700," Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the impossible burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minnicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. The years in the lab, patterns colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron's sponsor could love. And the impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger, it tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's like a burger, it tastes like yuckers. The full is the world's relics. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat, shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO, they stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. We won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019, so impossible which is still privately held has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish I had nothing but success, they have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market, it's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat, they're a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture and whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when Impossible Pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5106,2022-10-21 00:44:33
16701," because well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with the crogr supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long term sea change for these companies. I don't know. What's that doing? It's safe to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything like that. Very, very much. Thanks. Water is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan. It sits very close to Iran actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is a contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The Crown Jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialised. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to build the United States.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5107,2022-10-21 00:49:06
16702," that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. A long-term, beautiful future for all countries to develop a content. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterizing China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, a highway road, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. It's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shout up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. It actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port. Even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer. Concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5108,2022-10-21 00:53:13
16703," Kostan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port, and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births, and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes. And a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense, but eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. You know, no one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward-based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarankoastal highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway, express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a $500 million development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community, if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out and were supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5109,2022-10-21 00:57:41
16704," Continues to pour China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they were an extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big tempo release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market. And characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy and sell CDs. And these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle, so we were actually pretty bad with counting money. You can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car. You know, you can kind of think about it the same way. It was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, the Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and as CD Projekt released the Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5110,2022-10-21 01:02:09
16705," I'm a symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Red has become this behemoth of an institution in Poland and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do and making a lot of money and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of the Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and enforced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up concerning by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for the Witcher 3 CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like that. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5111,2022-10-21 01:06:19
16706," wrong It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release and then they showed off a trailer at the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show and they showed off a it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else we could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Po-ly. This if they can live up to what they showed me it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs their thousands of them each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to death. So yeah so people were certainly blown away by this demo of 23 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projects is very much a marketing driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away which it did but that might have come to the cause of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh what?! These look... The end of the year of being there, of walking the streets of a future is really going to be breathtaking. You're a breathtaking! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. And you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up and up and up and to the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projects stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seekings.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5112,2022-10-21 01:11:06
16707," was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me, specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who is a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to crash, that people will not have to work mandatory over time on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch. Including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with The Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we've created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient, or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or they said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch is per their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative, and overworking them is just getting a less and less product activity. And so these guys, the People at CD Project, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whatever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case, it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5113,2022-10-21 01:15:08
16708," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today, the U.S. government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was not attacked on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRG News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Gun hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China, to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Gun regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5114,2022-10-21 01:19:11
16709," It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber-hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available, and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describing accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a studio studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jong were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And when he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call Bats. They are very popular online games.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5115,2022-10-21 01:23:31
16710," It's a whole different part to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Chang had to make at least $100,000 in a year. And he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the Korea, and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about their Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China, during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. John was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to, and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, John would accompany that official. He doesn't know what he's doing. He's not a big deal. He's not a big deal. He doesn't have a lot of hacking units in China, John would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details. He calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with, and that altercation prompted him to defect. turned to after affecting him. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders. He would reverse engineer a software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. It's just he wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, once they were able to freely roam in the internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. And then, a little fire.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5116,2022-10-21 01:28:03
16711," telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spar gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s, sometimes referred to as the mauling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually getting people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jc penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have, you know, a reason for people to shop in the first place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5117,2022-10-21 01:32:31
16712," or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside them all. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penny. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penny and then riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? Green Briar is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year, and yet residents and store owners hope that Green Briar mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Green Briar is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburban house in a leafy yard.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5118,2022-10-21 01:36:37
16713," They worked hard their whole lives, you know, to be able to experience the American dream. The single family suburb in house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great NACES. And you know, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Greenbrower may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing, you know, in 2016, up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences, I mean, everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting like concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Making Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically, the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall. And they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the king of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics firm Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from 8 to deed just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bowel harborshops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their property, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those, building their big fulfillment centers. Also a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. Domals these before your career part. Models supports selling well and with text print, so to that you're very recommended.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5119,2022-10-21 01:41:14
16714," He developed, re-inhabit, this dead mall, to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. Sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools, moving into malls. Then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. The category is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I sent the case to still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia is in business to save our home planet. Manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office. Again, again, on the loop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5120,2022-10-21 01:45:28
16715," To help people find the polling place and on that digital platform, it says both the climate deniers out of office, again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonian. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy, who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about, he calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I will delinquate, because you know they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. The category was born out of rock climber, Avanti Romance, first business, Schuwenart Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Avanti Romance was a blacksmith in the 50s and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Avanti Romance is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Avanti Romance and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calmer all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the new Samiti where the sport became a lifestyle and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuannard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuannard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura California where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuannard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits like on-site childcare that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuannard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's for land free. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be socially conscious.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5121,2022-10-21 01:49:29
16716," I don't think it's for Lentry Edge. It's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on shown art or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuernard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday. Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said, don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty gritty on, you know, the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into, you know, and at the time Schuernard said, the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant. Talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer, and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last, but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rosemarcaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that, to me, was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy, they're good.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5122,2022-10-21 01:53:59
16717," Summers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizeable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle. As it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things, it's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas, including Adventure Capital Fund for Environmental Causes and Sustainable Food, revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike, who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform, and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel, and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagonci label is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular, of course, with people who are active in the outdoors, but also with people who are not as active. For instance, people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office, and that's because of the image that the brand projects, and so they have to be with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. As COVID-19 brought the business well to a halt, and the American people voted in a new administration, Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on, and I'll be uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship, but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree, and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about, and that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5123,2022-10-21 01:58:40
16718," Also, now we'll play a lot of games that are conservative about the outside and are all extremely resistant to creating situations. This is a really exciting game that makes a lot of sense to the players who are in obviously outbs of the mad world, I think you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability and everything we do. So really forward looking. Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with alphabet CFO Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5124,2022-10-21 02:03:29
16719," Oh, her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Poorat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Google Club. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View, and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three to work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip, so we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular, sites where you have great, diverse populations. Soon, Dar just told me that Googlers will have this option of working in hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously, you're embracing this massive cultural shift, but what are the risks? What are you worried about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of alphabet, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well, I love doing it work in Stanley and I became CFO of the day James Gorman became CEO yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. I were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. My view in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well when I was starting my career many decades ago it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience and I love it. As the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were going to reign in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots, your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your lungs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5125,2022-10-21 02:07:03
16720," That is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition everything can't succeed. And so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working I would say one of two things are wrong either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're going to get there. So to me a really natural part you know kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking. Stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together actually and so I find the narrative it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking they go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the great recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and so you know there was that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a interable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content moderation security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hangpaws at one point said to me you have to have the will in the means and too often by the time you have the will you no longer have the means. His comment was be decisive act early even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long term growth because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume you know what we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road you'll say I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well I look I think back to March of 2020 and where we were and I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then and you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back and it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular as you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to but because they want to.

Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. The goal is that some think Google would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us and so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues. What is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them? At the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So you know, I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. That's what we are doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5127,2022-10-21 02:15:59
16722," as a monopoly. So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this eight search engine, the question is, why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst, Mary Meeker. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. I look at, for example, in something like health, where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent to teach our conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt.asz cup wasyncrálô You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5128,2022-10-21 02:20:24
16723," I learn to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there, and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons, and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to. I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. You know, we had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level. If I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt. And when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG. And my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside. Because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I'm wrong? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? And so I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can. And it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it. But I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Well, thank you. Do not. We're in the middle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5129,2022-10-21 02:24:32
16724," I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Thank you. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? You know, huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want, and how do they want to work, and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? Are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google's a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say, I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role and they've been their amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is really around, what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phil and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then, 10 years from now? It's fascinating, I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users, to solve what they need, where so many people are coming online and is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice, first, and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally, where will you, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey. And I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things, and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Ruth Porat, thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus.

So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So. You're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? Yeah, and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go in you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Born and raised in India, Pichai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt, you know, your market cap elevation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. You know, there is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshort as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. You know, we've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microphone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5131,2022-10-21 02:33:45
16726," invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, every day when people come to Google, they place their trust in us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a health issue on which they are trying to understand. There's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. When we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think those who will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully. So I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder than the reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And you know, but I think this doesn't belong to any company, I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5132,2022-10-21 02:37:21
16727," of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible, they can work from home, they can work at the office, they can be hybrid, they can work remotely permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we have really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together, the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of three two. And what we are giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we're trying to get the best of both was, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India. And a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. But fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way from.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5133,2022-10-21 02:41:51
16728," area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and and you know definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters and but at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris agreement so I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough but you know we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resource into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing, it's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030 and to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. Over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So, part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a 13 time frame. You know, I'm glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are their leapfrogging trends, which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So, many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So, a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So, super dynamic region, I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so, I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China. And you are facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, is increased by the news coming out of Glasgow, what the US China agreement on climate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5134,2022-10-21 02:46:06
16729," What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability, it's another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China, I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll, you know, we'll see that. It's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And anytime we are developing technology, there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it's, it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start?

How have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. So for example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay. I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come in. People leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think that are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. And I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. And the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. How did you start? Hi, you know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. Okay. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game's any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games. It's a fact. It's a phenomenon. Green time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and, you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things.

16731," Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You should feel the need to make a choice. You always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but you know, in and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, you know, I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and, you know, in some decisions way on me. And, but I, it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all, you know, fine. On the second thing, I am lucky. I'm so energized by the things we need to do. You know, I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy.

16732," Cooking and preparing food Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski.

16733," You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did and it's at Jeff Bezos is taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. Of course Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. Of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. The conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. And that process did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication but it was principally with Andy who of course was a new AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role but yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. We just still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded and so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff and I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in but I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon is a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, had started before other companies really started to take this seriously, was an enormous, frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I didn't have to slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books, but the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy start.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5139,2022-10-21 03:07:40
16734," or being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore, and you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question, because we are currently the leader, and I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents, and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on, on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency. And you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody. Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge. And we all compete vigorously. But it is, the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really, for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things? And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? You're going to get me in trouble aren't you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5140,2022-10-21 03:12:00
16735," MUSIC You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? We as you know I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams so I've had to endure that for a lot of years. So what are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. Exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it. And operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and will having operated that business for so long. And I expect that it'll also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful. I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. Right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out. Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community. And I care a lot about those things as a lot of other people do here but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy day to day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now so he's got a pretty intense day job I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously AWS remains an important part of Amazon and so we touch base regularly be it in person or via email just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean really from the beginning Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously over time we, the business grew. Jeff was always available when we needed him and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities but certainly Jeff has been available when",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5141,2022-10-21 03:16:30
16736," So is he still available now and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, wane on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, what we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did. I've got to tell you, am I used to, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing obviously is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days. 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. You mentioned the senior leaders. If you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse, we have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5142,2022-10-21 03:20:44
16737," Fund, exciting, innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. You know, we, I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're gonna be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's gonna be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. Hmm. A. W. S. has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy, and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information, hackers and criminals, want that information. Well, we're really going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to do that. And, you know, the criminals want that information. Well, we're very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year. Every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, it's a pin of that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers' data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. So it's a very clear way to do that. So we're not going to be able to do that. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we've built a lot of different encryption capabilities that we've created and which could leak for any reason. Be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is ready today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the back end. Servers to the analytics and everything in between. That's what...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5143,2022-10-21 03:25:30
16738," You know, 50 million users worldwide and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the back-end servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real and yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be on me, on me, on me, on the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now, I know that climate change, you know, and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030, we actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries? All new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassi is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

Since this, very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist, pop culture, and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism, and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens.

It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology things moved so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, I'm with invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us. And with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? I would say, join being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so, a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5145,2022-10-21 03:34:10
16740," benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main value of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue. And that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube in the last year. And so that's just an example of how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say, they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. How can I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world. And YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago, during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, you can just post and become a creator. We have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. It's all important to our YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company. So YouTube first, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos. And we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5146,2022-10-21 03:38:15
16741," enabling those to be found and then a lot of the creation tools and so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are like our own metrics like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing and if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators. We're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, create our economy and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people you know we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for you know it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk. Where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people you know we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think first of all we're always learning. I just just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing and I care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5147,2022-10-21 03:42:44
16742," content. Do you take it personally and how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing and I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean sure I think whenever you're in a position like that there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? How much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. It should be making changes to our policies. YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out on the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just and that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions and the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see and that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube we started working on YouTube kids which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and they're family and you know there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on on teen users? The influence it might have on on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all I think it's a it's a very important topic and we we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5148,2022-10-21 03:46:59
16743," Um, and that that for a lot of kids, um, it's really, it like destigmatizes, um, and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO, but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. Um, and that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is, that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? The question integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important. Um, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important. And we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that are and there continue to be a number of leaders that that poster that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the, from the government. And we'll certainly continue to have that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5149,2022-10-21 03:51:21
16744," events in the news, signals were seeing from the government. We'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. We have stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for the Russian opposition leader, Alexine Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the curtain being concerned about censorship back then, and Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the requests, what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sender has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And you know, if if I were ever asked to testify, I certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom, you have five kids, and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast. And I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are like the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, sorry, I have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5150,2022-10-21 03:55:46
16745," ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects where I feel like I don't have that much more to add, then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think senders doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not not not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes it would be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage, it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. Like I just met with a number of three, three creators and like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one, continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to like be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have. And I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and make see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, which is PCO YouTube. Thank you. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5151,2022-10-21 03:59:33
16746," x This is Blumak Daybreak, Middle East, our top stories this morning. After a historically short and turbulent 44 days in office, this trust resigns as UK Prime Minister. The race to replace trust is now on, contenders will need the backing of 100 Conservative lawmakers. The fact Patrick Harker says officials are likely to raise interest rates to well above 4% this year and hold them in a bit to combat inflation, attack lead advance fizzles on the news. And Turkey cuts rates again by more than forecast even in the face of 83% inflation, but could the central bank be nearing the end of its easing cycle? It's going to 8 AM across the Emirates, I'm used to give it a deal and Dubai Manuscrane is taking the day off. There is a lot happening in these markets. I'm looking here at equities where overnight in the US we had a 1% rally, but then that fizzled very, very quickly as bond yields got boosted by hawkish Fed speak. We're called a little bit lower now on the S&P 500 again about 3.10% of 1%. In the last hour there's been another wave of bond something that's coming through US 10 new yields push even higher at 426-21. The pound wavering after Liss Trust resigned as the prime minister. The markets life team is saying that the chance of a new chancellor is a bigger risk to the pound than a new prime minister and Brent Crude holding steady with a little bit of upside here of half of 1%. I want to talk about the British pound in more detail because it's become a lot more volatile than some of the other assets out there. It's a world's oldest currency, still in use since inception more than a thousand years ago. It's almost as volatile as the new convert Bitcoin of late. This is your 30-day volatility GTV for the perspective remarkable how.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5152,2022-10-21 04:04:39
16747," It's an exception more than a thousand years ago, and it's almost as volatile as the newcomer Bitcoin of late. This is your 30-day volatility, GTV for the perspective, remarkable how these two lines have converged in the last three to four weeks. And then on the stock side, Snap got snapped in the United States. And yeah, they made a lot of changes in terms of staffing in August, and the expectation was that they would come through with some level of revenue growth that was encouraging that didn't happen. And it's really more about the guidance when it comes to Snap that drove the aftermarket trade here, down about 27%, the line that caught my attention that's most ominous, is we are finding that our advertising partners across many industries are decreasing their marketing budget, the slowest sales growth ever as these advertisers begin to retreat with ramifications far beyond Snap. Let's see how the markets are holding up in Asia. Don't you, Leadson, it joins us from our Singapore studio, Jules. We are never far from a Sino-US tension headline, a user, and we are watching very closely the tensions amidst the chip space as we hear that the U.S. is expanding its China tech band to quantum computing and AI. You do have a bit of an uptick coming through in the Hang Seng tech index on the lunch break there, but the broader tech space is being sold off as our Asian equities on track for a second week of declines. We are of course continuing to be on Jan intervention watches. We saw the dollar break through that 150 level during the U.S. session and still dollar strength at the moment by about two tens of 1 percent there. And of course, it is a big tick up in Yields. We're seeing globally as well. Have a look at the yield. On Australia's 10-year-up, 17 basis points now at its highest level since January 2014. Of course, we're continuing to watch what's happening in China's markets too. I mentioned the tensions there between the U.S. and China increasing, but we also had that positivity in the afternoon session yesterday on the news that quarantine could be dropped. Let's have a look at my chart here as we're continuing to watch levels on the CSI 300. And particularly, what could come through in terms of the bearish signal for the index? 3500 seems to be the important support level here. So we might go down a lot more if that support is breached markets, of course, very much weighing up the geopolitical tensions versus a hopeful opening of China's economy, Yusuf. Jules, thank you very much for those highlights. We will compare notes later on in the program again. That is Jules Nitsali there. I want to get from markets in Asia to the drama in the UK because after a historically short tenure of just 44 days in office, Liz Truss has resigned as UK Prime Minister. We set out a vision for a low tax, high-grace economy that would take advantage of the freedoms of Brexit. I recognize, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. The announcement probably came faster than many had expected and the hunt to find her replacement has already begun with the Conservatives aiming to choose a successor within a week. Now, given the time pressures, the party isn't insisting that contenders will need the backing of 100 Tory lawmakers just to get on the ballot. We fix a high threshold, but a threshold that should be achievable by any serious candidate who has a realistic prospect of going through. A threshold of 100 members of parliament nominating a candidate obviously allows for three candidates potentially to come forward. We clearly have no say or no knowledge of who those candidates will be at this point. Let's put our teeth into this. With Leanne Garence, she joins us from our London headquarters. Leanne, there's not a lot of time to find the new Prime Minister who realistically here has a chance in the running. Yeah, absolutely not a lot of time is there. That was what Sir Graham Brady was saying there, the head of the 1922 committee really outlined. It's a weak maximum because they want to draw a line under Liz Truss' premiership after that disastrous tax cutting budget that we saw that really sent markets into turmoil. So who are the runners and the riders? So Rishi Suneck, the former chancellor, according to a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5153,2022-10-21 04:08:38
16748," Lee sent markets into turmoil. So who are the runners and the riders? So Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, according to Betis, bookmakers even, he is in the lead at the moment. Then we've actually got Boris Johnson, who's coming in second. That would be a spectacular return for the former Prime Minister. And in third place, according to the book, he's as Penny Morden. She's really been auditioning of late, hasn't she? She's the leader of the House of Commons and she's did stand in for Liz Truss during the urgent question that was put to the government by a Labour and by all accounts she did a stellar job. Yeah, she did bad away. A lot of the hard questions from parliamentarians. Where does Truss was 44 days in office at historically? I mean, this is a new record, isn't it? It is a new record. We did see history being made. She is the shortest serving British Prime Minister. So that's how she'll go down in the history books. And really now is the time for the Conservative Party to really get the public and the economy back on their side. The Conservative Party has plunged in recent polls. We see them some 30 points lower than Labour. Labour are surging at the moment. And really, this is time for the government to unite in the face of the pressures they've been fighting use of. Liz Truss did stand down yesterday. She did admit that she had made mistakes. She also made changes to her cabinet. She put in grant shaps and she also put in Jeremy Hunt who a Rishi soon act back as to try and shore up support. But that just wasn't enough. So moving forward, the Conservative Party are looking to unite after a fractures few weeks. Yeah, so much to consider as we count down to the announcement of a new Prime Minister of the coming days. Leanne, thank you. It's Leanne Garen's in London. I want to get to the corporate developments because Twitter is telling its staff there are no plans for company-wide layoffs following a Washington Post report saying that Elon Musk intends to cut its workforce by 75%. That's as Biden officials discuss whether the US should subject some of Elon Musk's deal to security reuse. Sukinen has more from New York. People close to the Biden White House have told Bloomberg that US officials are becoming increasingly concerned with what they perceive as Elon Musk pro-Russia stance. And the fact that he has plans to buy Twitter with a group of foreign investors. Apparently a particular concern was Musk's recent threat to stop supplying the store-linked sat service to Ukraine, the sources say, although after coming under fire for complaining that it was costing SpaceX companies some $80 million, Musk did tweet out that SpaceX would continue to supply the service for free. In any event, the discussions by the White House officials are said to be in the very early stages as officials consider legal options. Meanwhile, it looks like actions to finalize Elon Musk's $44 billion buyout of Twitter are actually proceeding toward completion by that court-imposed deadline of October 28th at 5pm. That's a week from Friday. Musk said on his Tesla earnings conference call that he's excited about the situation and he said, quote, he's obviously overpaying. Another important development Twitter has denied a report from the Washington Post that Musk told investors when he was putting the deal together that he planned to cut 75 percent of Twitter staff when he takes over the company. That would cut Twitter staff down to a skeletal 2000 plus operation. A memo from Twitter's General Counsel to Staff says no company-wide layoffs are planned. Sookin and in New York. And from Twitter, we take you to some of the other stories we're watching with the first word headlines from around the globe. Julie Tselly has those from Singapore.

European Council President Charles Michel says it sends a clear signal to the market that the block is ready to act together. Well, sources say the US is looking into new export controls that would limit China's access to powerful emerging computing technologies, which hold the potential plans focused on the still experimental field of quantum computing and artificial intelligence software. The Biden administration, excuse me, has also said to be working on a review mechanism that would scrutinize money heading to certain Chinese technologies. Well, the White House has accused Iran of sending trainers and technicians to Crimea to support Russian attacks on Ukraine with Iranian-made drones. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says Iranian advisers are helping Russian pilots based in Crimea to operate the drones. Kirby also says the US will consider new sanctions against Iran over the weapons transfers. And the St. Louis Fed says it will think differently in future about its officials participating in private events. The statement comes after criticism of President James Bullard for speaking last week at a private event hosted by City Group. Bullards' appearance could be seen as a violation of Fed rules on communications that aim to avoid providing a profit-making firm with any advantage. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg. Quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, you sir. Thank you, Jules. Let's get you a bit of a snapshot of what else is still to come on the program. We're going to get the health check on the regional economy with Goldman's Farooq Sousa as a slowdown lingers.

You may have never had the Lehman effect. Then the Fed will have to win out. You'll have a severe recession and you'll have a financial market shop. They're going to win out for sure. A very concerned bearish, Nouriel Roubini there, speaking to Bloomberg's AdLots podcast. Stocks are extending the clients as Treasury yields climb to the highest level since the global financial crisis. Swaps are pricing in a 5% peak policy rate. In the meantime, at the first half of 2023, there's more federal officials re-intimate their commitment to aggressive action. Let's bring in Deepak Mahra, he's the head of investments at the commercial bank of Dubai. Deepak, what we're seeing in US Treasury yields at the moment is eye-watering a 12-week losing streak that matches what we saw in 1984 when then Fed share Paul Volcker went about rate hikes at the moment US 10-year yields breaking through 4.25%. When is this going to start stabilizing and what does it mean for risk assets? Good morning. Yes, it is unbelievable what we're seeing here. It seems that the Fed is on an autopilot and it just can't do anything till something big breaks. And Dr. Doom just rightly pointed out that there could be a big financial accident. We saw something very close to that with the UK pensions. We've seen how Swiss national bank had to draw on the swap lines, emergency swap lines, and then we saw the reserve bank of Australia wiping out its equity as well as its lifetime reserves. So anything that has leverage around the world, anything that is sitting on fixed income with leverage, anything that has debt is likely to break. And that is when the Fed will pivot. Until then, they don't see any reason not to be huckerd. The sense is that financial ruptures are going to occur. And we've seen it everywhere around the world. And I don't rule out something big in the US as well because there is a lot of leverage in the system. And that could be a big financial institution. We've seen that in Switzerland with credit suites. So everything is vulnerable. In the European market, you can see 47 of them are knocking on I'm of doors for bailouts. So many things around the world could break. At some stage, the Fed cannot be ignorant because it's going to come back and haunt them. My worry is that the Fed is seeing the government data which comes with lag. They've been tightening so aggressively and such a short time. It is possible that they're done the job. I mean, you've seen several of these cycles over the years. Of course, this one's a little bit different with the higher inflationary environment. But nonetheless, you've been sitting down with clients, you've been building out strategies. How do you best prepare for that kind of financial accident to make sure that you're ready to jump in on the right bets? Because you could also go down the other side of the trade and come down hard. Absolutely. I think in times like these, it is very important to know what is that that you will avoid. So irrespective of the mouthwatering yields that we are seeing in emerging market hard currency debt or in certain high yield spaces, we would avoid them even if the Fed were to pivot. Because this story is still not over. I think the best strategy right now is one on the equity side. Go back to the fundamentals. There's something called dollar cost averaging. Go back best in these times. And you could do it on the index. You don't even need to select stocks because the indices are down battered. And we probably at the end of this painful cycle. And the other thing is hold cash. Because cash would give you opportunities and you've been compensated well to hold short-term cash. Is there an additional consideration we need to start making? There's a trending story that the US is eyeing, expanding the China tech ban to quantum computing and AI. This growing divergence between China and the United States.

16751," This growing divergence between China and the United States, is there a new risk premium that we need to start building into some of these valuations? I think the risk to globalization is something that we have to be cognizant of when we look at S&P earnings about 30-40% of them coming out of outside of the US. And so, yes, absolutely. I think we have to be very cognizant. China, as the case is, and I've been saying it for a while, remains uninvestable. It is still no visibility on when it will become investable. Even though it's looking very attractive, we would stay away. I know you've been cautious on U.K. assets for quite some time, but now with the Prime Minister or former Prime Minister trust in a few days, and potentially new Prime Minister taking over, is there perhaps a chance to open a new page in the U.K. after what has been, you know, a crazy period? I mean, there's no word for it. I think the problem over there is very deep, and I don't think any Prime Minister has a magic wand that can be waived and we get away with the crisis. It all began with Brexit when a small island just decided to cut itself off from continental Europe and the rest of the world, and then COVID made it worse. And now we are seeing the fallout of that. And so, the crisis is very deep, and the U.K. economy has to reinvent itself. It has no manufacturing base. The services base is moving, parts of those are moving into Europe because of the Brexit effect. So how do you retain and attract high income and growth drivers to your economy? I think the problem there is will take some time, and no Prime Minister will be able to fix it in a jiffy. Deepak, I'm a big fan of your candid insight, so thank you for joining us on this Friday that said, Deepak Merah, he's the head of investments at the Commercial Bank of Dubai. We still have much more to come on the show. This is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates, the second generation expands, and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, I hate and love again. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength, but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. Blackstone's president and COO says this location sparked by the UK's political turmoil are creating investment opportunities for his private asset firm. Jonathan Gray told Bloomberg why he's still bullish despite Prime Minister Liz Truss surviving just 44 days in office. We're being believers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5157,2022-10-21 04:25:43
16752," Nothing great, Old Bloomberg, why he's still bullish, despite Prime Minister Liz Truss surviving just 44 days in office. We're big believers in the UK long term. Near term there are challenges obviously around energy, around inflation, but long term, the UK has some great attributes. It's a country that has a real magnet for talent, particularly in London. It's got rule of law, transparency, liquidity, and English speaking population. And so we think over time capital will come back to the UK. And as investors, sentiment has been really negative. The pound sounds 17% year to date. The stocks in the UK market are trading at less than nine times earnings. And that to us represents opportunities. So the near term may be tough, but as long term investors, we like to look at these things and think about the opportunity to make investments into dislocated moments, which is clearly what we're seeing now. So let's talk about the numbers for a second, because on one hand you have profit that is lower than a year ago, but on the other hand, you did still bring in almost $50 billion. I'm really curious here as to how those things really square off. Do you think that this environment will get tougher for a firm like Blackstone, but investors are seeing through it? Or do you think that the tough environment here is going to keep people away from private markets for some time? Well, I would say as it relates to our quarter and results, we're really proud. And we're proud because our mission is to deliver great returns for our customers. And that's what we did in the quarter with markets down across the board. We protected capital. We outperformed. And that's really driven our business. And that's why you continue to see these inflows into our various products, $45 billion in the quarter, $183 billion in just nine months. That's what our business is, deliver solid results and investors and trust us with more capital. Well, markets are more challenging, but if you look back over time at Blackstone, through all sorts of downturns in the early 2000s, early 90s, 0809, the many downturn in 2020, we outperformed. And so I think what you're seeing is a continued vote of confidence in our firm and in the breath of our platform across real estate and private equity infrastructure, credit hedge funds. By delivering results, we did track more capital and we continue to focus on what we do, but we recognize it's a tougher economic climate. It's a tougher investment climate. And for all the Blackstone front, I take you to markets this part of the world and overview where we saw the Saudi Tadauwol see its biggest one week gains since July. So the last training day of the week for the Tadauwol up about 1.4%. Saudi romco was in focus after the Bloomberg report on a potential IPO move of one of its subsidiaries. Broad gains are for the rest of the region only to buy and Abu Dhabi come back online and later Friday. The rest is off on the weekend. They come back on the Sunday. I take you from at least equities to the story of the moment and that is in US treasuries where we're seeing additional gains around the 4.25% mark for US 10 year yields. A wave of bond selling with hawkish fed speak boosting yields. US treasuries entering the longest sustained slump in about 38 years. And that of course is weighing on risk sentiment broadly so equity futures on the pressure on the S&P 500 many were called a little bit lower here about a quarter of 1% the corporate earnings on the tech side not encouraging with snap getting snapped the advertising prospect dire basically decreasing their marketing budgets. And that's going to ripple through the sector much more coverage ahead this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5158,2022-10-21 04:30:19
16753," Come on! ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Power policy politics from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill as I understand it is there'll be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. This is what we're going to break, but at least our top stories this morning, after an historically short and turbulent 44 days in office, this trust resigns as UK Prime Minister. I recognize though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. The race to replace trust is now on. Contenders will need the backing of 100 Conservative lawmakers just to get on the ballot. Boris Johnson, who only stepped down as Prime Minister in July, is amongst the frontrunners. Defense Patrick Harker says officials are likely to raise interest rates to well above 4% this year and hold them in a bit to combat inflation. Tech-led advance fizzles on the news. And Turkey cuts rates again by more than forecast, even in the face of 83% inflation. But could the central bank be nearing the end of its easing cycle? Let's look back on the markets in Asia this Friday. See how they're holding up to the it's Ali has all their key insights from our Singapore studio, Jules. Hey, yes, if we are set for a second, a week of declines here in Asia and most of the markets that we track are lower. We've again got China's COVID policy very much in forefront. We had that little bit of a bounce in afternoon trade for about an hour or so. Yesterday on the news that China could be reducing quarantine, but then I've got she under lockdown. So again, we have these concerns that when are these policies going to ease? And at the same time, you've got more US China tensions too with the US expanding this China tick band to quantum computing and AI. Also, of course, continuing to watch this dollar strength story, you can see pretty much every Asian currency lower. And particularly the Japanese yen, which fell through that 150 level in the US session. So we remain there on intervention. And it remains a story of rising yields as well, Jules. Have a look at the bond column on the GMM, particularly Australia's 10 year, the yield up 16 basis points its highest since January 2014. And then in light of the US sanctions against Chinese tech companies, now we've got a call for BNP Parava. I mean, in terms of how to trade it, where is the arbitrage? Yeah, exactly. They're actually saying go long, China semis here, because if you do have an increase in sanctions from the US, then China is going to be forced to accelerate its transition to focus more on its local market. A lot faster than perhaps at would. So they're saying that is a better call and go short. The global peers here. They're also saying that China semiconductor industry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5159,2022-10-21 04:34:56
16754," It's a local market. A lot faster than perhaps at woods. So they're saying that is a better call and go short the global peers here They're also saying that China semiconductor industry will accelerate faster in terms of its reliance on local equipment Also saying that right renewable energy a names are pretty good and of course as we're talking about the relaxation in terms of the COVID rules across Asia they're suggesting go long Asian Pacific travel and tourism names Short the MSCI Asia Pacific index as we continue to see more tourism around this part of the world you said Jules, so thank you very much for that. That's a Juliet Sally there Let's get to Turkey now because the central bank has slashed its benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points The decision-surprise economists see it again. They predicted a smaller cut. Let's get out to Simone Fox, but from doors or Simone I mean is there any end inside to this rate cutting cycle? Well, we may be nearing the end, but we're certainly not done yet That's the economist expectation because the central bank signaling we could get yet another rate cut next month And if you turn into our GTV go as you mentioned you said if you'll see that economist expected a rate cut here But it was bigger than anticipated third surprise and as many months and under you see at the bottom This pushes real rates and even farther already intensely in negative territory President Erdogan has pledged single digit interest rate benchmark by the end of the year and the central bank really seems to be keeping up with that pledge Even though they offer a little bit different rationale. They say they're transitory price pressures That are going to go away soon because of actions that the government has taken to try and mitigate some of the Rising inflation also because they see a resolution of regional conflict I'm not really sure where they're getting that exactly this very much looks like a political play by President Erdogan to juice the economy ahead of elections Next year, but it does have a lot of risks for both the economy and the country's fiscal stability And let's think we're turkey for a minute because we've seen science that the US is stepping up its pressure over its ties with Russia I mean what exactly is going on here? Yes, so this week there's been a US delegation there led by Elizabeth Rosenberg and she has quite the complicated title assistant secretary for terrorist financing and Financial crimes at the US Treasury, but essentially we understand this visit really had to do with Turkey's lack of compliance Around sanctions that the US and Europe have placed on Russia over the war in Ukraine and now Turkey as you probably know Has come out and actually condemned the invasion, but at the same time it's gone and struck Deeper economic and trade ties with Russia. There is an economic indicator that we are watching here very closely And I think this speaks to the overall turkey story This is the foreign exchange reserves Russia sped up a bunch of payments made a bunch of investments that kind of boosted this number that was lagging at the end of the year So when you think of the geopolitical situation from Turkey you also have to think of the domestic economic Situation because if Russia is helping the Turkish economy really the lifeline there then clearly that's going to impact the way that Turkey Treats sanctions the way that Turkey mediates in this conflict And then the neighboring Egypt top priority at the COP27 climate summit next month is winning support from the United States We've also got some news on the affront Yeah, Egypt has always been the message they've always said about what they want to happen at COP27 Has been we want to talk about compensation for developing countries The around the impacts that they have seen the damage and loss they have seen because of climate change This is a topic that has been long been talked about but it hasn't been an agenda item However, the US as well as Canada coming out in signaling support for this taking a larger role in the discussions We've seen these commitments by these rich countries to devote a hundred billion dollars a year to support Emerging markets damaged by climate change Pakistan may have really changed this conversation because those commitments have never ever been fulfilled That's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5160,2022-10-21 04:38:46
16755," but the two things regarding currency. Number one is that a step devaluation is necessary. We need to see a significant evaluation of the jurisdiction pound, probably something in the 10 to 15% area in the coming days. And we expect that to happen in line with the IMF. Once the IMF is signed, we think that there's going to be a devaluation. That's really just to shake out the backlog and the FX system and to get things moving again in the FX market where the shortage there has become acute. But beyond that, what does the new FX regime been look like? There seems to be a very significant commitment both by the Egyptian authorities and also in terms of the IMF's actual monitoring of the FX regime going forward that we should see more flexibility. Does that mean a free float? I think there's still going to be a significant amount of management by the Egyptian authorities in the FX regime. But certainly it's going to be a lot more flexible. And we should see a lot more volatility. Crucially, I think for international investors, this means this kind of insurance policy that they had coming into the market at a fixed rate and coming out at a fixed rate is no longer there. US10U yields are moving higher at an aggressive rate. I mean, it's been a 12 week losing streak. The longest such streak since 1984. If it continues at this pace, at what point does it become a problem for Egyptian policy, which had been calibrated to maybe a slightly more supportive and a culminative environment? Well, I think first of all, a couple of comments in terms of domestic policy. Clearly there are independent inflationary pressures in Egypt as well. We saw inflation take up in the last print. And clearly the rate environment there, the risks are skewed to the upside. And we could see some more rate hikes in the coming months between now and the end of the year. But the broader issue about US rates is clearly on the external funding side as well, where Egypt is going to have to live with a higher cost of funding. And that's really driving Egypt strategy towards relying less on external debt and more on attracting foreign direct inflows. In terms of the rest of the region, I know you're covering the Saudi Arabian economic picture very, very closely. Now with sort of energy prices positioned for potential gains, where does that leave a growing windfall for Saudi officials? And that potential usage for the new year? Well, I think relative to our forecast, these we've always had oil prices relatively elevated. I think for us, the difference is the fact that the Saudis are going to have to cut production quite deeply in order to support prices at this level. And where they end up on the production side is still relatively unclear. And we're going to have to wait to see what that number is going to look like, what their production number is going to look like before we can accurately predict what the overall size of the windfall is going to be. But a windfall there will be. That's been the case for a while. And what we're expecting to see is an acceleration in investments in domestic mega projects or giga projects at the Saudis, called them. We haven't really seen a huge amount of investment. In fact, the PIF recently told us that they've invested about 15 billion in these giga projects over the past year, which is a huge amount of money. So we should see that accelerate going forward, which should drive more economic growth in the non-o sector. What would you say needs to change from a agility point of view if Saudi Arabia is going to successfully weather this coming economic turbulence? I think the key pressure point inside Saudi Arabia has been the local banking system and the liquidity in the local banking system. We don't have any concerns around asset quality and things like that. But certainly liquidity has been an issue. And if we look at the cyborg, live ore spread, that has been widening very, very significantly over the past few weeks. I think in order to stabilize local financial conditions, the summer, the central bank needs to look at that situation and needs to consider ways in which to try and put a break a little bit on asset growth in the local banking system. And otherwise improve liquidity conditions there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5161,2022-10-21 04:45:08

President Biden with his thoughts on List Trust who's stepping down as UK Prime Minister just after 44 days of charge. Let's now talk about golf banks because Bloomberg intelligence is out with new research and the crystal is our expert on this front for major financials across the region. He joins us around the said let's start off with some of the Katari landers. You think they're unlikely to outperform. That's despite some of the silver linings. What's your thesis? Morning, Yusuf. I think it's become clear to the market that the underperform is on its way for the Katari bank. We've seen there is no credit to growth happening in the Katari banking sectors and this is proven by Q3 decline in the loan balances. The government is flush with liquidity with higher energy prices and this led the government to repay their overdraft facility quicker and the intensity has been very high is even not anticipated by the bank. We don't see any credit to growth within the banking sector and Katar this year. Despite the consensus is still flagging 3% credit growth so there will be a cut to the consensus in the coming days. We're looking now at some of the price earnings ratios in terms of their peers in Saudi Arabia and Farouk Shusa talked about optimism on the macro front despite a very difficult global environment. How they're fairing in the kingdom though I mean aggressive rate highs. I mean this is very interesting environment for the Saudi banks. If we look at the Iran large duration gap on the balance sheet they've been growing significantly their mortgage portfolio so if we think about it mortgage portfolio average duration is 15 years and on the liability the deposit is around 3 to 5 years. So with aggressive increase in the rates we expect changes in deposit behaviors so depositors start moving their deposit into more contractual deposit with this shorter time maturity that generating interest for them and that will increase the duration gap which means there is more capital at risk for this bank and you're going to see more assurance of subordinated debt by the Saudi banks and all of this is what doesn't mean it's mean that capital cost for this bank is rising and the property and the long term will come down from the private",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5162,2022-10-21 04:49:34
16757," O.D. banks. And all of this is what doesn't mean. It's mean that capital cost for this bank is rising and the property and the long term will come down from the prior cycles. We were chatting around the water cooler yesterday about some of the balance sheets in the United Arab Emirates for some of the lenders. What is your outlook this morning for the UAE on the banks? I think the banks in the UAE are well positioned into this rate cycles. They haven't been growing significantly in the last three years. The liquidity is ample even if you look at the credit growth here to date the 3.5%. So they haven't been deploying their liquidity significantly. The balance sheet is liquid, which means they can benefit it from the interest rate hike on higher spread on the margin. Credit growth is likely to slow on the second half of the year because the cost of borrowing is rising which means mortgage demand has to come down. And also we hear banks saying that they have to be selective on the corporate lending, which you have seen a pickup in the first half of the year. Because the cost of borrowing and refinancing is rising and that is for asset quality going into next year. This is continuing. Thank you very much for that. That is Edwin Christu from Bloomberg Intelligence. Looking here just to the red headline that is crossing the Bloomberg. This is from India. They're seeking a 7.7 billion dollar valuation for IDBI, the bank in a stake sale.

So, Leon, I mean, when you look at the papers this morning, there's this spectrum, and you usually have to skip a heartbeat just because of how powerful the headlines are, but usually somewhere in between getting put on the pedestal and getting thrown in terms of your legacy for the sharks. Where are we at this morning? And I just wanted to point out there, just all the mirror. We can see it right there. It says, general election now. And last night, Patrick English from Yugovl, sent me a snap poll, which says 63% of the population want a general election. So, there we are, the daily mirror, calling it out. I just want to point out one other thing. The Times and the telegraph use have... Now, they are backing Boris Johnson. You see them with the headlines of Return of Boris. And this is what we're hearing, aren't we? As this leadership contest really heats up. It could be a spectacular return for Boris Johnson. He's not currently the favourite. Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor, is. But lots of rumours that Boris Johnson is making his way back from the Caribbean, really to try and get 100 MPs on his side. The Daily Star talks about, let us rejoice as a headline. And for our global audience, we might not be very well versed with some of the verbiage coming through from British politics. So, what exactly is meant by that? Well, the Star... A newspaper, I must say one thing. Yesterday, when Liz Truss resigned, I felt like so many people were posting pictures up on social media about the lettuce. And the big question was, could Liz outlive the lettuce or would the lettuce outlive Liz? The reality is the lettuce is outlive Liz. And now you can see that the lettuce is rejoicing. It looks like it's got some champagne tipple there. But really, this was the Daily Star that started the feud between the lettuce and Liz Truss, who could live longer. So, just a bit of British humour there for you. Yeah, we left it to the very right of that graphic, probably for good reasons. What about the remainder of the Daily and just in terms of the chronology of events from this point forward? So, the ballots open now, really. So, Tory MPs are putting their nominations forward for who they want to be the next leader of the country. That closes on Monday afternoon. And then we'll really see the forward runners and riders as we have heard from Sir Gray and Brady a little bit early on when I spoke to you, Yusuf. He says, the next Premier will need to have 100 nominees. So, that will sort of wiggle the candidates down to three. It's really have 350 seven Tory MPs in Parliament at the moment. So, that will be the setting stage for the next step in this leadership battle. And we just have to wait to see now. But as I said, the bets are really on. We've got Rishi Soonak, the front runner, Boris Johnson coming in second, then Penny Mordent. But the most important thing we have to look at here is can the next leadership and the next Prime Minister bring calm to the markets, Yusuf. We have seen so much turmoil since... Yeah, Hamil...with Lurstrasse's tax-cutting budget, haven't we? Yeah, but it's all of it is a little bit exhausting, especially on a Friday now. I mean, it's just been very intense. I'm not British, so I'm looking at this from a bit of an outsider's perspective. And it's starting to become quite a lot. It's taking quite a lot of my time, every day. Leanne, thank you for that. That's Leanne Garant, and London. I want to get to the markets, treasuries in particular, because we've seen a wave of bond selling in the last 90 minutes or so again. So, US 10-year yields crossing the 4.25 mark for the first time since 2007. We have seen 12 weeks of selling now. The Longstreet since 1984. And that is weighing on risk appetite. So we're looking here at equity futures that are looking to extend some of the weakness we saw overnight on. The Nasdaq futures down about 7-10, so 1%.

Late on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but we'll need to change that to reach a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. You will shed light on dark matter.

Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have a great question. Great question. Great question. And pest question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. I recognize, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.

16760," is exploring a gas price cap as the confidence leaders tackle the looming crisis in Brussels. Good morning. Happy Friday. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Danny Burger in London. And you made it to Friday after another extremely turbulent week. A week where the bond vigilantes are back in charge, whether it be helping to push trust out of the premiership, whether it be pricing in 5% as the Fed funds rate for next year in May. It is a market that is risk off after those moves. It is equity futures that are declining this morning. Europe stocks. Those are significantly lower than the rest of the world after all. They did end higher last night. S&P 500 futures. Those weaker down by 3 tens of 1 percent. Tech is under performing. Snap earnings sending the stock plunging post market 27 percent, taking the rest of the social media giants with it. Also not helping tech is a market. Again, that's pricing in 5% for the US. By next year, Feli Fed's Patrick Harcari yesterday saying that rates are likely to rise above 4 percent. What else is adding to this? Well, that has formed a yen that is plumbing 150 versus the dollar. Let's switch up the boards. And you can see that there. The second asset, the yen continues to sell off versus the dollar. Steven Ines over at SBI asset management pointing out that the speculation is right that social banks are selling US bonds in order to fund FX intervention with that yen. The weakest since 1990. Of course, when it comes to currency, is we are squarely focused in on the pound. Sterling, it is weaker. And it's not just a stronger dollar store. You can see the pound is also weaker versus the euro as well. At the moment, options are pricing and continued pain for sterling, despite the fact that Liz Trust is out. Yes, Liz Trust has quit as Prime Minister. The UK has been plunged into a fresh political crisis following the resignation of its shortest serving Prime Minister. Her chaotic 44-day tenure saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Here's what happened after the lectern was placed outside number 10. I recognize, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. For more, let's go to Anna Edwards, who's live in Westminster. Anna, as we watch social media celebrate a head of letters that lasted longer than Liz Trust, what happens from here? What's the process now? Yeah, the light relief from social media at this point, I suppose, is at Danny Good morning, to you from Westminster. So the process is that the Conservative Party embark on trying to find their third leader so far this year from Johnson's at Trust. Well, let's wait and see. The 1922 committee and those who run the party have been putting together a process and the focus is on it being quick. That's the key points. Let's listen to how Graham Brady described how this process was put together. This is, or the key parts of it. He, of course, is chair of the 1922 committee, which represents the back bench, Tory MPs. We fix a high threshold, but a threshold that should be achievable by any serious candidates who has a realistic prospect of going through. A threshold of 100 members of parliament nominating a candidate obviously allows for three candidates potentially to come forward. We clearly have no say or no knowledge of who those candidates will be at this point. So a maximum of three candidates will get onto the ballot because you need the supporters. He said of 100 MPs to even get there. And then the focus, as I say, is on this process being quick. We could have a prime minister, Danny, by Monday. That's if the party essentially manages to decide amongst itself if the runner-up decides to back down in the face of all the turmoil we've seen in recent weeks. It's worth saying that the Labour Party and other opposition parties are calling for a general election. That looks, though, at this point, to be much more of a political will than a constitutional requirements and so, therefore, pretty unlike he's happened. Well, OK, so we need three people to be at the forefront at this moment. And if you look at the papers from overnight, Boris Johnson is on the front of maybe half of them. How chaotic is this likely to be? Who is likely amid that potential case?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5166,2022-10-21 05:06:53
16761," How chaotic is this likely to be? Who is likely amid that potential chaos to be the one who takes over? Well, I suppose it could get chaotic, Danny, but the upside is at least it will be short. There is the possibility that Boris Johnson comes back to try and run for this. He hasn't declared his hand fully yet. He's actually on vacation on holiday at the moment, perhaps cutting that short to come back and try and bounce back into number 10. There are many in the party who would like that to happen. They say he has a mandate from 2019. Others point out that he's still under investigation by the committee on privileges because of all those scandals that went behind, that went before, that predated the Prime Minister's ship of Liz Truss. So that will be a contentious issue that we will look to get to the bottom of over the weekend. Other names of course in the fray, wish he soon had the former Chancellor, although the Johnson camp don't like him because they blame him for triggering Johnson's downfall. But he has had, if you like, a good crisis, if that was what we call what happened to guilt markets over recent weeks because he essentially forecast that this would happen if Liz Truss got into power and if Trussedonomics was implemented. Well, Trussedonomics might be dead Anna, but what's still very well alive or the economic issues in the UK? What is the next Prime Minister going to be inheriting? Yeah, they're going to be inheriting a cost of living crisis, a squeeze consumer, of course, a recession either here or on its way. And so they're not going to inherit very much room for maneuver. How much the Prime Minister manages, whoever that ends up being, manages to stamp their authority on the country is up for debate. We know that the bond vigilantes were back. We know that the markets to some extent have been calling the shots of late. We've seen that in the real strong pivot away from growth, growth, growth under Liz Truss towards a new much more sort of care take a safe pair of hands approach from Jeremy Hunt, the new Chancellor. And I would just say on that note, the market is watching him closely. We know that he's going to be talking to the banking sector next week to see whether taxes on banks might be an area he looks to to try and close the fiscal gap that still exists. We're also watching the 31st of October carefully. The times here in London is reporting that perhaps that date might move. We'll have to see whether a new Prime Minister who might not be announced until Friday of next week would that really leave them time to get to work with their Chancellor on some kind of fiscal statement? Perhaps not. So well, the market might be interested very much in the future of Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor. And also what happens to that fiscal event on the 31st of October? All right. And a busy day ahead for you in the Edwards there outside of Westminster. For more analysis, we're now joined by Alan Wager Research Associate with the UK in a changing Europe initiative at Kings College, London. Alan, thanks so much for joining us this morning after a crazy 24 hours, a crazy week, a crazy month. First, your reaction to Liz Truss resigning can the Conservative Party draw a line under this period of turbulence? It's going to be difficult to draw a line under it. The trust era, well, it's not really an era. The trust month and a half will stand with the Conservative Party. It's going to be hard to shake off that economic incompetent tag. Whoever becomes the next leader of the party, we now enter this period over the next week or so of huge uncertainty. The massive curveball, if you like, of the potential for a return of Boris Johnson. So there's no clear inauguration plan in place. There's no clear strategy in place by those that have taken Liz Truss out. They're sort of men in grey suits. They've gone into tell us a leave. There's clearly huge uncertainty now in the future direction of the Conservative Party. Whether it moves towards this move towards economic stability and so on, whether it tries to, whether it thinks about the returns of Boris Johnson now. Alan, to that point, I was talking about this to Anna Edwards, the fact that a lot of the papers this morning have Boris Johnson on the front page, whether it be the Daily Mail framing it as Boris V. Rishi, whether it be the Suns having Bojo saying I'll be back. There's the Daily Expressing. Will Boris bounce back to number 10? What would this look like if Boris Johnson runs or gets some serious backing? Well, it's a hell of a, it's a hell of a story. And the UK newspapers love a great story. What we need now, you're going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5167,2022-10-21 05:11:14
16762," Well, it's a hell of a story. And the UK newspapers love a great story. What we need, what we need, you might have talked about it with that. I mean, you're the 100 nomination papers, or 100 nominations from Conservative MPs. And then it'd be likely he would get to the members vote. And it's clear from the surveys of members we've seen coming out over the last 48, 72 hours, if you like that the Tory membership are willing to either forgive or forget or both. The reasons why Boris Johnson had to leave office in the first place. It may not be, it's probably highly unlikely that the actual general public, the voters are going to be as willing to forgive the transgressions of Boris Johnson, particularly given you've got down the track in the next month or so, a series of hearings that will speak to his character and ultimately lead him being suspended from House of Commons. But at the moment, there's a sense that the Boris Johnson's been carried forward by the momentum of the idea that he's the only person that can sort of save the Conservative Party at the moment. There's a sense of a whiff panic if you like coming through the Conservative Parliamentary Party today. Well, in terms of support of Boris Johnson, again, among the wider public, you say they will be less likely to forgive him. But Alan, regardless of who becomes the next Prime Minister, they don't have a national mandate, nor do they have a mandate from the grassroots Tory Party. What does that mean for their ability to enact policy change? It's not clear at all that there's a majority in the House of Commons for the tax cuts that Jeremy Hunt has been talking about, has been talking up since he became Chancellor. And it's not really that clear at all whether there is a majority for any sort of tax rises either. So that's the problem now is that whether or not there was a mandate from 2019 for either trustonomics or the sort of populism of Boris Johnson, in a way the political situation, the economic situation now, is so different that it's going to struggle to... The Conservative Party is going to struggle to be governable regardless of whether it has a mandate or not regardless of what the democratic merits have of having an election. One looks more and more likely now than it did a few months ago. The Boris Johnson dynamic brings with it the possibility of a potenti of a party split and the numbers in Parliament dramatically changing as a result of that. So that's a further sort of unknown that's in the mix. I mean, all these feel very negative for the Conservative Party, Alan. How long do you expect these scars to stay? How deep will they be? And what will be... When we look back on this in five, ten years, what will be the state of the Conservative Party? Yeah, Tata often pinpoint these moments when you get these big changes, these shift changes, if you like, in British political life, the Conservative Party has been in power now for 12 years. Before that, the Labour Party was in power for 13 years, pulled out the Conservative powers and power for 18 years. So what we see is these big transitions and we're going to have to see a lot of soul searching from the Conservative Party, which went down a particular route with Brexit and then a lot of the economic wounds, lit the economic divisions, the economic cleavages in the party, where I actually disguised often by first Brexit and then the economic populism of Boris Johnson who was able to be all things to all men often. And now we have these big economic divisions between the sort of leveling up agenda we saw and what we saw from trust dynamics really, really exposed within the Conservative Party. They're going to have to come to some sort of agreement about what the point of the Conservative Party is. And that's better done really in opposition than while you're still going to be in government. I'm also seeing some soul searching probably coming from you as well after agreeing to get up at 6am for us to talk politics, but we really appreciate it. I would wait for you. Thank you so much.

16763," at Kings College London. Go back and get some sleep out and you deserve it for a chaotic weekend to come. Well, coming up, U.S. bonds fall into their longest slumps since 1984. We'll be taking a look at the swap market, which is driving the sell-off. It's the Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel, to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years, as soon as the 2030s. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these guys absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. Written in crisis. I'm resigning as leader of the conservative party. The shortest ever serving Prime Minister. Trust Bloomberg for the fastest coverage and instant expert analysis. Here's a general election enough to begin to restore some of the credibility. It takes a long, long time for the markets to forgive you. You are now from an economic point of view. Tinker it. Brexit has not gone away. We'll wake up car here for the conservative party. For continuing coverage, keep attuned to Bloomberg television and radio. From UK bond vigilantes to ones of the American variety, the swap market is now pricing in a peak of 5% for the Fed's fund rate in the US for the first half of 2023. That's driven a worldwide sell-off in bonds. These days are in the longest sustained slump in 38 years. For more on this, joining us is our market reporter Valerie Taitel. Valerie, 5%. 5% Danny, we've hit another milestone. And yet again, we're going to go into a Fed meeting where the Fed has to catch up to market expectations. I've got a chart here which just kind of simplifies where we are. The last SEP data, the last dots we got from the Fed showed that their 2023 dot was just over 4.5. The market is now pricing 5. It's just incredible. Yet again, the Fed will be chasing its tail. And again and again, we're hearing from Fed officials that the fight is now in core CPI, but I want to show you another chart on this, Danny. It's the break-even market, which is a market-traded expectation of inflation. They have gone higher all this month. The entire curve has shifted higher. Meaning that you cannot discount that we might get another bout of headline-driven inflation coming into core CPI just when we expect it to turn at the beginning of next year. And not Mali over Miller, Tayback calls this the America first version of Fed policy. So, Valerie, don't we have a situation where the higher that that terminal rate ratches up, it just adds more pressure on the BOJ to.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5169,2022-10-21 05:19:50
16764," was this the America first version of Fed policy. So Valorant, don't we have a situation where the higher that that terminal rate rises up, it just adds more pressure on the BOJ to exit their extraordinary easy policy? Yeah, exactly, Danny. This could be a big mess, not just for Japan, but the spillover effects from the bank of Japan breaking on their yield curve control would be incredible. The amount of fixed income volatility, the amount of term premium that would flood the bond market, it's a scary thought, so scary that I want to take you through this chart and just how scared the market is. This is the 10 year yen swap versus the yield on the 10 year yen bond. This red line here, this is Japan's yield curve control at 25 basis points. Now, the market is getting so scared about a break that they're willing to pay now 40 basis points above that line in order to put a hedge on. Now, that's just incredible. This was the last time US yields topped back in mid-June we've now surpassed those worries. We've turned a corner and this is happening, Danny, at a time where Japan inflation hit 3% just this earlier this morning. The trade deficit year on year, Danny, let's into this, 40% higher the cost of their imports due to a weakening currency and a higher energy prices. It's just incredible how nervous the market is over scenario like this. We don't necessarily know when, but it could be coming soon. Some scary numbers and a scary chart just in time for spooky season. Valerie, thank you so much. Valerie Taitel, our markets reporter. Now, coming up on the program, the US considers expanding its chip restrictions on China to cover quantum computing and AI. We'll bring you that story next. This is Bloomberg. Taking the steam toует. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Beijing has some chip makers in for urgent talks over the past week as it tries to assess the damage of U.S. curves on Chinese semiconductor firms. At the same time the U.S. is looking to expand the restrictions further. For more, we're joined by Rebecca Chung Wilkins, our Asia Government reporter in Hong Kong. Rebecca, let's talk first about the expansion of these restrictions. What does the U.S. look like they're targeting now? Well, it does look like the Biden administration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5170,2022-10-21 05:24:32
16765," In the early stages of potentially expanding those export controls to quantum computing technologies and also AI technologies, which would be quite a significant expansion. The plans themselves are still in early stages. They're said to be in discussions with experts over precisely how they would be enforced and rolled out too. What will China's response likely be? We know from reporting that they've gathered with some leaders in the space, how are they likely to tackle this and take this on. Absolutely. There does seem to be a bit of a question mark around precisely how Beijing is going to muster coherent response. We know that that meeting took place, you know, focused specifically on how the immediate impacts are going to be for China's many sort of companies that rely on access to these high tech chip manufacturing and chip semiconductors. I think the other question for China in particular is to what extent they're able to garner support from its allies and partners to make sure that this sort of attempt by the US possibly to bifurcate between countries that choose to continue to access China's market rather than pull back in line with the US curbs. Whether or not China is able to influence that. There are, of course, many countries who are going to be caught in the middle of this, many Asian countries in particular. And so there is this uncertainty over precisely whether or not they will want to sort of effectively be forced to take sides here. Rebecca, thanks so much. Rebecca Chung Wilkins, our Asia government reporter in Hong Kong. You saw that board next to her. Some of the chip names falling. I've got some more for you. We're seeing losses. The ones before we're showing more than 4 percent. Some of these around 3 percent. Now, the chip stories don't have the only thing that's earning tech. It's, of course, higher fed funds rate that we're pricing in and Snapchat earnings yesterday shares plunged after the bell on its lowest quarterly sales growth ever. It fell as much as 27 percent, a little bit more than that as a decline in advertising spending dragged on the results. Now, that sell off its spread to its peers with meta-pinterest, alphabet, all selling off. Now, at the same time, one type of company of ad-based company that isn't here can speculously missing is Twitter. And it's got its own whole host of problems. It's been telling it's staff that there aren't plans for company-wide layoffs falling Washington Post report that Elon Musk intends to cut its workforce by 75 percent. White House officials are also said to be discussing whether to subject some of Elon Musk deals to security reviews. Sukinen has the details. People close to the Biden White House have told Bloomberg that US officials are becoming increasingly concerned with what they perceive as Elon Musk's pro-Russia stance and the fact that he has plans to buy Twitter with a group of foreign investors. Apparently, a particular concern was Musk's recent threat to stop supplying the store-linked sat service to Ukraine, this source is say, although after coming under fire for complaining that it was costing SpaceX companies some $80 million dollars, Musk did tweet out that SpaceX would continue to supply the service for free. In any event, the discussions by the White House officials are said to be in the very early stages as officials consider legal options. Meanwhile, it looks like actions to finalize Elon Musk's $44 billion buyout of Twitter are actually proceeding toward completion by that court-imposed deadline of October 28th at 5 pm. That's a week from Friday. Masadone is Tesla earnings conference call that he's excited about the situation and he said, quote, he's obviously overpaying. Another important development Twitter has denied a report from the Washington Post that Musk told investors when he was putting the deal together that he planned to cut 75 percent of Twitter staff when he takes over the company. That would cut Twitter staff down to a skeletal 2000 plus operation a memo from Twitter's general counsel to staff says no company-wide layoffs are planned. Sukeen and New York. And for what its worth, Twitter shares did fall slightly after hours, but not as dramatically as those other social media giants considering they fell some 4 percent or snap 27 percent just.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5171,2022-10-21 05:28:44
16766," What is worth, Twitter shares did fall slightly after hours, but not as dramatically as those other social media giants considering they fell Some four percent or snap 27% just down through 10th of a percent I mean what a difficult stock to trade it is under that price that Elon Musk has offered for it 5420 of course is that price so we are under that at the moment So perhaps some still skepticism priced into this as to whether or not the deal will go through But the increased scrutiny does feel like we are inching closer to that along with the memo of Fire and folks that again Twitter has denied now coming up we're gonna be speaking to tell you CEO Allison Kirkby after the Swedish company reported We'll break down those results for you next. This is Bloomberg A digital first approach for the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading It's not the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead There's that word Metaverse good. Well. How are you doing? When I think about the metaverse I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence Wow look at this. This is me the metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade And whether you know it or not you'll probably be working there in the future We're moving into a world where we're gonna be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy I think the adoption curve is gonna be slow. It's weird a real floaty thing right now Oh look at you if I can have no legs It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey Good morning. Happy Friday. This is Bloomberg Day Break here up.

It's the usual culprits of yields higher stronger dollar European stock futures Those are on the lows for the session",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5172,2022-10-21 05:33:02
16767," Fed funds rates next year. So we're looking at a sell off on equities. It's the usual culprits of yields higher, stronger dollar. European stock futures, those are on the lows for the session down 1%. They did end the day higher while the S&P sold off. So they are doing worse this morning. Tech is also doing worse this morning. Nasak features down 7, 10 of 1% after those abysmal snap reports yesterday. Concerns that an economic slowdown will mean that companies will be cutting back on their marketing spend. But here's the rub. It is a 10 year yield that is now 4 and a quarter percent. It is up in additional 2 and a half basis points this morning. We heard from Philly Fed president Patrick Harker yesterday saying that the terminal rate could be well above 4 percent. And let me tell you, this is a market who has priced it well above 4 percent. It's not just that. It's the constant drumbeat of positive company earnings. Perhaps that means that companies aren't cutting back so they will continue to spend. It's also higher oil prices after we looked at an OPEC plus cuts. After news yesterday reports yesterday of China reopening. And then we have a yen, a dollar versus the yen that is trading at 150. Steven Ines over at SBI asset management pointing out that there's been a lot of speculation in this market that because of the levels we're seeing not just in the yen but really across currencies versus the dollar that we're having more defense coming from central banks. What does that defense look like? It looks like them selling treasuries. So the feeds into this loop where you get treasuries sold off, yields push higher. That hurts currencies and they need to keep doing this. How long can the coffers stay? And then of course the pound sinking despite the fact that a new prime minister will come in both versus the dollar and versus the euro. Let's get to some of our other top stories this morning. What's the first word news is Juliette Sally in Singapore. Jules. Hey, Danny, the White House is accused of a run of sending technicians to Crimea to support Russian attacks on Ukraine with Iranian-made drones. Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Valoromiz Zelensky says Russia must compensate his country for the destruction that has been brought by Moscow's invasion. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the bloc's energy crisis. That's after Germany yielded to pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. European Council President Charles Michel says it sends a clear signal to the market that the bloc is ready to act together. This in law's fed says it will think differently in future about its officials participating in private events. That is after criticism of its president James Bullard. For speaking last week at a private event hosted by city group, Bullard's appearance could be seen as a violation of fed rules that aim to avoid providing advantage to any market participants. Adidas has issued a fresh profit warning as unsolved goods pile up and consumer demand weakens across China and Western markets. The German sportswear maker says it now expects an operating margin of 4% this year down from a prior forecast of 7%. The CEO, Kasper Raustead, has already announced he's stepping down next year. Global news 24 hours a day on air and Don Blumberg, quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Blumberg, Danny. Jules, thanks so much. Juliette Sally there in Singapore. Coming up, we're going to take another look at the runners and riders and the race to follow Liz Truss as UK Prime Minister. Could it be Boris Johnson? Could he be making a comeback? We'll also dive back into the European earning story. This is Blumberg.

16768," There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates, the second generation expands and the third generation destroys and that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating a Love, you're good. Now I have a much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries, they were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage. The S.O.

Even still the company says the outlook is being impacted by energy prices and rising interest rates. Joining us now to discuss that outlook is Alison Kirkby CEO of Telia. Alison thank you so much for joining us. We will get through your numbers but I got to start with what's top of mind for possibly everyone where I am this morning and it is political volatility. In the UK I know you don't have exposure there but of course Sweden your biggest market did just have a new government come in that's perhaps more to the right. How are you viewing political volatility in trying to run a multi billion dollar business? Well we are just getting on with our business as you would expect and we are just delighted that the Swedish government has been able to form a lot faster this time than it did in the last general election four years ago. So all the ministers have now been appointed and I am very much looking forward to meeting a new prime minister and his ministers in the coming weeks. So I think we have a bit more stability here than where you are sitting today Danny. The bar is low Alison let me tell you. Okay so political risk check that's not an issue for you of course the other macro risk which you wrote what you talked about in the earnings release itself is energy what is the energy outlook mean for your outlook and your ability to forecast and try to get costs in check. Yeah so we had continued very strong commercial and operational momentum this quarter and delivering absolutely in line with our midterm ambitions 2.3% and the top line 4.9% in the bottom line but we saw energy double in the quarter which meant our underlying EBITDA only grew 1% and you know what we have seen is our energy has gone up by 900 million this year so it's almost a doubling in the year. What we're doing to mitigate that clearly we're delivering on our digital transformation plan which is helping offset some of those headwinds and we're clearly working with pricing initiatives to ensure that we can continue to provide the region with safe secure high speed networks which we're increasingly seeing are under demand. So we just have to we're hedging as much energy as we can we're buying PPAs but we're just very much focused on the plan that we set out to deliver last year. There have been some analysts who have talked about your 20,000 employees and consultants a key worry would you look at either revisiting numerous in or just hiring in general to try to tweak some of those costs. Well our plan is to reduce our headcount by around 1000 FTs per year that was underpinning our digital transformation where we're taking out 2 billion crores.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5174,2022-10-21 05:41:40
16769," The plan is to reduce our headcount by around 1000 FTs per year. That was underpinning our digital transformation, where we were taking out 2 billion crores by the end of 23. We're just very much sticking to that plan and accelerating where we can. And we are seeing that our unions across the region are being very reasonable in the negotiations that we're starting to have with them for the balance of this year. But clearly, we need to step up everything we do. We need to make our products and services the best they can be. And we need to be to price them relatively for the value for money they offer during these times. Alison, just quickly here, because we only have a few moments. We had snap earnings out last night. There were concerns about digital advertising spend. You, of course, have some exposure to that revenue stream as well. Are you seeing a pullback in digital advertising spend? Not yet. We had another 20% growth in our digital ad spend in Sweden this quarter. And we had an all-time record third quarter for our advertising business. But clearly, as we look forward, we're being a bit more cautious. But there's no sign yet of any of our advertisers pulling back. But we'll clearly take any recessionary pressures into our outlook for next year. And that's why we're holding back on any outlook for next year until we report our fourth quarter results at the end of January. Alison, I'm afraid that's all we have time for. But thank you so much for joining us. A pleasure as always, Alison Kirk, B-C-E-O of Tilia. Now, there's political chaos in the UK, as we all know. Let's take a look at a snapshot of Liz Truss' brief time in office. I have a bold plan to grow the economy through tax cuts and reform. It was becoming a distraction. So that's why we immediately change that policy. And that's the kind of government we are. We will keep an eye on grip on the nation's finances. Mr Speaker, I think the last thing we need is a general election. We need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline. I have therefore decided to keep the increase in corporation tax that was planned by the previous government. I am a fighter and not a fighter. I recognise, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. So that's what Liz Truss said. Let's look at some of these dates. Go through it. We had on September 5th, her winning the leadership contest, each announces government energy support package, then the mini budget on the 23rd following the Queen's funeral, and then she refrains many backpelling until the 3rd of October. That takes us up to now a succession of U-turns, sacking her chancellor, ousting her home secretary, ultimately after 44 days, her own resignation yesterday, a historically short term as prime minister. Let's get out to Anna Edwards, who's at Westminster. Anna, what does this process likely to look like, the one to replace her? I think it's a dramatic stress from looking at that very speedy recap. All of that happened in just 44 days as you point out just a month and a half. So the process from here is going to be quick. That is the aim of it at least. And the way it's been set out is that there's quite a high bar for getting onto the list, and there's a maximum of three MPs who can get onto the list to stand as the next leader of the Conservative Party. So we're going to be watching carefully who those three are, of course. That should become clear over the weekend. Voting happens on Monday. And it could be that on Monday, later on Monday, we have the answer as to who's going to be at the prime minister. But it could be that we have to wait until Friday. Because if the MPs can't decide amongst themselves, it goes to the membership and that will take a little bit longer. So Monday, possibly, latest Friday. Of course, it should be pointed out the Labour Party and other parties are calling for a general election. But most constitutional experts seem to be saying right now that this might be their political wish. But it isn't a constitutional requirement. Transversive power within parliament have happened before and probably will happen again. And let me just say, I mean, there are people walking around behind you. The fact that people are out around Westminster at 6.45 in the morning, perhaps, is indicative of the intrigue and just, you know, amusement. And that lead to more life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5175,2022-10-21 05:46:13
16770, Let me just say I mean there were people walking around behind you the fact that people are out around Westminster at 645 in the morning perhaps is indicative of the intrigue and and just you know amusement I don't know confusion over this. Thank you so much. Yeah exactly and thank you so much and of course we'll be back throughout programming and her show is in the next hour so stick with us for that. We're going to dig into the story now more here on daybreak mark on small chief economist at ADM investor services joins us now. Mark what does it say that we have a market that essentially if not dictated was heavily influential in pushing a prime minister out. Well it's not really surprising I think there's two aspects to it and a lot of governments find themselves in very difficult positions at the moment so this has been a point less than pretty much for any other government which thought it could spend its way out of trouble. That markets given high debt levels post covid in many countries are not going to tolerate people who don't have a clear plan I think the other thing which is more important within it is there needs to be clear communication and this applies as much to fiscal policy as it does to monetary policy. If you get lack of clarity then you are likely to find yourself on the back foot with financial markets. What does that mean in terms of whose next is you look at the list whether it be Rishi penny bow Joe coming back. Will that likely inject more stability into the market picture. I think the problem is we've had this period of great instability the volatility in the guild market has been well I suppose I watering is one way of describing it. We are left with this situation that the confidence that was there in from markets has basically gone to restore it is actually going to take a lot more effort from the way it's been disposed of. People will be wanting to see first of all what Mr Hunt who is ostensibly going to be staying on as chancellor will have to deliver in terms of specific fiscal policy and then also see that the conservative party isn't going to continue with this bow to what one I would call intoniseign warfare because that undermines any confidence at all that you could go through yet another process of on seeking yet to be in the market. And that's not the case. We are not on seeking yet another prime minister or potentially going also to a general election and because of that markets will be on higher alert. What any signs that we are going back into a situation where everything becomes really really unclear at the moment that remains the case. Let's see if you buy or not that ultimately it doesn't matter it's not about the politics in terms of where this UK market goes whether where sterling goes because of the structural issues the UK is facing be it rising costs to borrow crippling energy bills high taxes. We look at risk reversals on the sterling that are deeply negative ultimately can you buy UK assets when that's the backdrop we're dealing with regardless of prime minister. I think that's absolutely correct the UK faces a lot of challenges as do a lot of other economies but the UK ones are particularly acute and you know what one has to add that a lot of this is not just because of what happened under Mr. Truss or under indeed under predecessor Mr. Johnson they are cumulative and they are much more acute than perhaps elsewhere and therefore getting the economy going is actually very important. Unfortunately what we're actually looking at in terms of the reversal which is the reversals which have been announced by Mr. Hunt is basically a very stagnationary environment and per se that doesn't really have the outlook for the UK. We talked to me more about that mark this idea of a new wave of austerity what would that look like what would be the economic impact. Well you were talking we've reinstated the rebound in the corporation tax.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5176,2022-10-21 05:50:23
16771," and stated the rebound in the corporation tax. We're looking at spending cuts in an economy where a lot of consumers are already feeling under a lot of pressure. So none of that actually votes particularly well and none of it is actually growth stimulative. So I can't, you know, I just can't see the situation in which this actually turns out to be more positive in the near term, regardless, as you say, of who the prime minister is. So the UK faces a long road back now. And to a certain extent, it's a situation of the conservative parties making. Yes, what is the road back not for the nation, Mark, but of the conservative party given that this is a party that prided itself on economic know-how? It certainly has done over the years, but certainly what we've seen on display in recent years has not been, that has not been the case. I think we are now looking at a party which is so deeply divided that the risk here is that it will at some point split because I can't see how the party can now unite and find any prime minister, whether it's Boris Johnson, which would be, I think, certain lack of a lot of credibility or anybody else. The fact of the matter is there are deep divisions and whoever comes in whichever wing of the party they come in from is likely to be attacked very quite hardly and beyond the mind by the other faction. And that is going to be very problematic as we go forward. Yeah, interesting. Our guest from earlier in the hour from King's Collin Allen Wager said something similar that this looks like it might be a turning point or soul searching for the party. Mark, thank you so much for joining us this morning. Mark Autswald there, global strategist at EDM investor services enjoy the rest of your Friday and this weekend if you can. Now coming up EU leaders react to lose trust's resignation but at the same time Germany yields on camping gas prices. We're going to have all the latest stories out of Europe for you. This is Bloomberg. All right. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put Lexus Ciccianda grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. In France, as a nation and friend of the British people, above all wants stability, especially in the current context.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5177,2022-10-21 05:54:53
16772," Above all, wants stability, especially in the current context. In a context of war, of energy crisis, it is important that the United Kingdom regains political stability very quickly. Let's move to the next question. Friends, President Manuomakrone reacting to UK Prime Minister Liz Truss' resignation calling for stability. Let's get more of the European reaction to the political and economic chaos in the UK. We're joined by Bloomberg's Maria today. So Maria, what are we hearing? Well Danny, well not a lot. And I don't mean that as disrespect, but it does show two things. One is of course, for European leaders, this is a story in which, with the focus on the energy crisis here, they really don't look at the UK now as a priority, but then two on a personal basis for a lot of European leaders. What they say is, we just don't or cannot express a lot of emotion when it comes to Liz Truss, because she was barely in office. We had barely no contact with her. Between Emma and Michael and Liz Truss, there was just a single bilateral meeting. She never made it to Brussels. She never even made it to a meeting with the head of the commission here in this city to debate. Well, the many pending issues that continue to roll over between the UK and the European Union. And that tells you in so many ways, well, so much about this relationship. For a lot of European leaders, this is a country that is very volatile. It's not stable. And the lack of stability as a French president alluded to means that there isn't a strong diplomatic relationship at the moment, because everything changes so much. I would say, though, I did ask the French president, are you sad to see her go? Are you sad about the state of affairs? And he did say we're in a very challenging global context. We do need a strong stable UK. And when it comes to Liz Truss, it's like saying, good, good. And bye to a colleague. Make up that will you will. And Maria, speaking of the challenges quickly here, EU leaders finally reaching an agreement over energy. Yeah. And very quickly, Danny, this was a meeting that really wrapped just a few hours ago, a 245 in the morning. Finally, they agreed to something. Now, let's separate the spin in reality to what's actually in this deal. They endorsed the political guidance to the plan that was put forward by the head of the commission. That includes the dynamic price cap, the joint purchases, the intervention in the TTF market. In terms of the details, there's not a lot, but they give it the political okay. And it does mean that in the next few weeks, we should see perhaps the legal tools for this to actually manifest in real terms in the market. It's important to say, by the way, the Germany has dropped its fierce resistance to a very price cap. We think our hours are bad. Maria, thank you very much. Bloomberg's Maria today over there. Now to quickly take you through some of the corporate news we've gotten this morning and overnight. Renault reported earnings and it was a mess. Yes, revenue did climb by 8.95 billion euros, but the estimate had been for more than nine and a half. They blamed some of the supply chain woes that continue. It's a tough time for automakers. Now it's not just the auto sector, which is experiencing some pain, do it your bank as well. Source is telling Bloomberg that they laid off dozens of staffers in its investment picking division. Deal making fees. That has been stymied with the volatility in this market. We'll continue to cover the volatility for you right here on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5178,2022-10-21 05:59:14
16773," MUSIC AIs is the chance of humankind to really understand itself. How much of that is true? How confident did you actually overachieve? Did you, you know, back then, realize that we would be using AI in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today. But I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or ten years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place. But I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this day, we still know very little about how the brain works. But these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel, in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things. Because AI or machine learning has become so good at so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence. Multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europa Manor Edwards live in Westminster. Markudmore, our market's live managing editor, joins us from Singapore as usual to take us through all of the market action this hour. The cash trade is just an hour away. Let's get to our top headlines. Political chaos. The UK could have a new prime minister as soon as Monday. After Liz Truss' resignation gave her the shortest premiership in British history. Stocks retreat amid high bond yields, the 10-year treasury yield holds at the highest level since the financial crisis. And unity on energy. Germany agrees to join other EU countries in exploring a gas price cap as the confidence leaders tackle the looming crisis in Brussels. Welcome to the programme. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's Europa. We're in London. Mark is with us in Singapore to make sure we don't take our eyes off the markets. What are the markets saying to you? Good morning, Anna. For once, I think I am more interested in politics than the markets. I'm glad you're out there in Westminster State because it is unbelievable what's happening on the politics side. And as a result, markets have actually been relatively calm. And even UK markets have been relatively calm as people wait to find it in the next prime minister's wait to find out what this means for fiscal policy. And there's been a little bit of pause from a whole year of volatility in markets where politics takes front and center. Yeah, absolutely. So politics to the fore once again, we should say here in the UK seems to happen all too often these days. Let's just get some breaking news. We've had retail sales numbers coming through this morning. So just dropping across the Bloomberg, UK September, retail sales. This is excluding fuel. So that's important to note when energy prices are so info. And the uncertainties that continue to mount. And we're also getting numbers of the UK budget deficit, a real focus when we're looking at what's going on in the UK, of course. And Mark, you've talked to us about this many times.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5179,2022-10-21 06:04:09
16774," September and fiscal sense, I suppose, and fiscal conservatism with a small sea. Certainly a real focus when it comes to the UK and watching what any future prime minister and any future chancellor, because we don't know for sure whether Jeremy Hunt would stay in that position, where we end up there. Any thoughts, Mark, on the UK days we've had this morning? This is a really terrible set of data. Those retail sales missed right across the board. They missed month and month, they missed the core data. The revisions were worse as well. So it's a month and month bigger decline from a worse prior month. It's really not great set of data. And as you mentioned, the public sector net borrowing is up as well. The UK is in. Away from the politics is even worse than we thought. And that shows the challenge that will face the new leader of the country that we're expecting in the coming days. Okay, so emphasizing the weak backdrop economically and the lack of moving room wiggle room perhaps, then any new leader will have when it comes to fiscal decision making. Now we're just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading here in Europe. So let's have a look at the future picture and it has looked pretty negative as we've gone through the Asian trading session. You can see S&P futures are weaker. Euro stocks 50 futures are down. So back down by 1%. And let's remember, we're playing a little bit of catch up here. Mark in Europe because the US had a pretty dreadful day yesterday. A lot of focus on the rising rates environment, the 10 year yield as we said in our headlines, getting to its highest level since the the financial crisis and that has captured the markets attention, captured the attention of risk assets as well. So S&P futures looked weaker there yet down by four tenths of 1% NASDAQ futures. Maybe the snap earnings not helping there down by seven tenths of 1% as well. So that's a sort of gloomy setup to today's trading Europe, Mark. What do you see in the GMN? So in the GMN today, it's about the yields and FX column primarily, not stocks and commodities. In fact, that's been the theme from a lot of the earlier part of this year, but recently we did get some stocks volatility. So first of all, as you mentioned on it, yields generally higher across the board. Now really interesting, 30 year yields of almost four basis points again today. 10 year 30 year part of the curve recently reached the lowest level in about 20 years. It's just started steepening again recently. We got very excited about 10 year yields rising to the highest as Ches and eight, but it's the 30 year yields that are really starting to rise the moment. I'm not sure what you want to take away a part of not. I mean, I think it could be interpreted that, hey, a little bit of less faith that the Fed is really going to get control of inflation here because the whole point we've got an inverted curve is they will get in control of inflation and cause a recession. A resteaping in the curve is saying, hey, maybe inflation is here to stay. The other thing is the dollar is strengthening. We've just seen the pound come onto this board after that data, pound thinking as well, but it was led by Asian currencies primarily in the Asian session away from that equities are mixed and commodity is pretty mixed as well. Okay, so that's the mixed picture. Let's just recap on the politics before we dive deeper into the markets then, Mark. The UK 44 day 10 year saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Trust said she was a fighter who wasn't going anywhere, but when the podium was rolled out in front of Downing Street on Thursday, it was all over. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. The Prime Minister there saying that she is resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. She stays on until a successor can be found as Prime Minister and we will get further details, we'll get into the details of how that will happen. Could happen as early as Monday. Mark, let's talk about the markets then in a few minutes and how they handle this and some of the other things we've been talking about this Friday. Let's start with the UK politics. What do we watch out for from here? Because I've already seen one newspaper in the UK reporting that the fiscal event we're expecting, the detail maybe is under, it is in question now on the 31st of October and I suppose maybe that's obvious because if you get a new Prime Minister.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5180,2022-10-21 06:08:27
16775," In question now on the 31st of October, and I suppose maybe that's obvious, because if you get a new Prime Minister, they need a bit of time to talk to the Chancellor. That might be, or might not be, Jeremy Hunt, of course, by that point. And so maybe there isn't a possibility of committing to the 31st of October, but the market might be nervous around when we're going to get any certainty on the fiscal path ahead. I think that's right, Anna, and while at the moment, obviously all we're focused on is who the next Prime Minister is. From a market's point of view, I think there is much more tension about what this means, very the next Chancellor will be. Whether Jeremy Hunt will stay in his job or whether he'll be replaced. Now remember, Jeremy Hunt is the person who added some credibility back into UK markets over the past week, and therefore seemed to restore a bit of calm. So I think that markets will be upset if it appears that any new leader will want to replace and will want a new kind of person in charge of the fiscal side. But yes, the news is focused on the Prime Minister. Markets will then immediately try to interpret what that means for the fiscal side and the Chancellor. Yes, and what do they need to bear in mind? Given the route we saw in guilt markets, given the nervousness that the focus on growth, growth, growth at a time when the markets were really preoccupied by inflation fighting, what is it that the new team, if it is a new entire team, has to keep in mind if they want to keep the markets on side? Bond vigilantes are back and they're in charge here. I mean, the UK was in a vulnerable position and Liz Truss and Quartang put the UK even in a more vulnerable position. So the UK now has no credibility left to lose. They can't make any single mistake or a misstep or they'll be immediately punished. And on top of that, as we saw from this morning's data, the fundamentals are getting gradually worse all the time. This is a country with a large current account deficit that is getting worse. It is a government with a fiscal deficit that is getting worse. It is a country with a poor growth outlook that is getting worse. It is a country with deeply negative real yields. And as inflation continues to soar, that outlook is getting worse as well. So everything from the fundamental side is getting worse. There's no credibility to spare. They literally cannot make a misstep. And we have seen, of course, that this has a very specific tension in the UK. It's focused on the UK and it was made worse by things that happened here in the UK, but the global picture is also of rising yields. And that's been something we've been reminded of in the US context in the past 24 hours. Yes, and that's why we've got this kind of risk-averse mood again. I've been one of those people thinking we might get a bit of relief rally for the next few weeks. I'm still in that camp. I still think that over into November over the next month, we do seem some positive moves, but there's not much enthusiasm in the moment to add on to risk in any market out there. Okay, Mark, thank you very much for thoughts so far. Remember, you can get up to date analysis and insight from Mark and the rest of the Markets Live team. MLIV Go is the function to use on your Bloomberg Summit if you want to find the Markets Live blog. Coming up on this programme, we're much more on the political chaos in the UK and the race to follow Liz Truss as Prime Minister. We've dealt with some of the Markets focus on the new Prime Minister, and indeed who remains or becomes chancellor a big question. We will get to some of the politics itself shortly. This is Libet.

16776," For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe just over 45 minutes to go until the start of cash or equities trading. Let's return to the big political theme of the morning and that is the search for another UK Prime Minister, another leader of the British Conservative Party. We're joined now by Lord Michael Howard, the former leader of the Conservative Party of course between 2003 and 2005. Lord Howard, very nice to have you with us. Thank you for joining us. A lot of the early talk around who could take over from Liz Trass has been around whether Boris Johnson will make a reappearance or bounce back as he might like to put it. What would your message be to members of your party who might be tempted by that option? I would strongly advise them not to be tempted by that option. Boris Johnson has had his chance and he blew it. He wasn't able to keep the confidence of Conservative Members of Parliament. So I think that to go back to the psychogrammer of the Johnson premiership would be a great mistake and I hope people don't make that mistake. Good morning Michael. What is a good option right now for the Conservative Party? Is there a good option out there? Yes, I certainly is. There's a very good option. I am a strong supporter of Rishi Tsunak who is a man about standing ability and would certainly take the right decisions. And I think there's too much doom and presume about at the moment to be perfectly honest. I didn't think that Liz Trass was up to the job and I think it was a great mistake to make her Prime Minister. And now we have the opportunity for a reset with a really competent team at the top. Of course we face challenges, though I think your last correspondent was a bit hysterical about them, but we certainly do face challenges. And I think we will have the right people in place to deal with those challenges. And when you look back at history, Michael, you think then that maybe we're talking too much about the doom and gloom, but there are, as you say, in your words, challenges facing the economy. Sometimes financial challenges or even financial crises don't turn out well for parties in power, which historical lessons do you take away? Because you could look back at the financial crisis and say, well, that didn't do very well for the Labour Party, of course. Or you can look back to the early days of FATURE and say there's plenty of time to turn things around. How do you take lessons from history here with your experience in the Conservative Party? I look back on one of the greatest political crises, perhaps the greatest apart from the war, in my lifetime. And that was the great humiliation that my country faced after the Suez catastrophe. That was a tremendous national humiliation far greater than what we're going through at the moment. And a few weeks after it's finished in ignominy, we had a new prime minister.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5182,2022-10-21 06:17:33
16777," And I think it's perfectly possible that we could see something along the lines again. The next 12 months are undoubtedly going to be very difficult and very painful. But after that, I think there's every reason to suppose that inflation will be coming down. Mortgage interest rates will be coming down. And the Prime Minister will be able to say we've been through a very tough time, but we've taken the right decisions. And now we're seeing the fruits of those decisions. So don't take any risks and don't let labour ruin it. Michael, I understand that you know, it's your role to put a positive spin in that. And you present this angle that the Conservative Party can make up the massive gap they haven't posed if they're given a time and a bit of a stable leadership. But what if it's not Rishi Sunak? What if it is Boris Johnson or what if it's one of the other candidates? Do you will you maintain that still very positive line that really the Conservative Party can turn this around? Well, let's wait and see. I think it's unlikely to be Boris Johnson. And let's wait and see. I mean, I can't. There are a number of hypotheticals in this situation. I grant you and I didn't think it's sensible to go through all of them. But I very much hope that the party will choose Rishi Sunak. And I think he can be a great Prime Minister. Michael, what was your assessment of the way that the Conservative Party's reputation it likes to pride itself at least on sound financial management, the way that that reputation has been to some extent distressed or maybe even trashed by trussonomics. How would you bounce back from that? Well, I think that if we have a sustained period of stable, sensible, sound Conservative government, we will all be able to look back on the last few weeks as a bad dream. There is no doubt that it has done damage. And it was, I thought, mistaken from the start, you can't have unfunded tax cuts. It's not a sensible way to proceed. And the markets have made that absolutely clear. But it's a short period. It's a bad period. But if we get the kind of government that I'm confident we will get, we will be able to look back upon it as a bad dream from which we've recovered. Michael, as you say there, the country can't afford unfunded tax cuts right now. Given the fiscal situation, are you saying that essentially we need a period of austerity again or even austerity light? And that is in the context that the country is facing a cost of living crisis. So it may be very tough for the populace to be supportive of the Conservative Party going down that path even if it was forced upon them? Yes, well, I say that. I think the next 12 months are going to be very difficult and very painful. And we can spend hours arguing about what constitutes austerity. They will certainly have to be some restraint on government spending. And Jeremy Hunt, who I'm certain will remain as chancellor. I'm as certain as I can be of anything. Jeremy Hunt will remain as chancellor. He's done a very good job in studying things in the few days that he's been in that office. And I think there probably will have to be, not probably, there will have to be some restraint on public spending. But it's pointless getting into an argument about whether it constitutes austerity. He has himself said that he was in the government in 2010, and he doesn't think anything like the kind of austerity which was necessary then is necessary now. That's the decisions will have to be taken. But they can and will be taken. And we will see the fruits of them in due course. Lord Howard, thank you very much for your time. We appreciate it. Lord Michael Howard, former leader of the Conservative Party joining us to talk about the future of the Conservative Party and the future leadership of the UK. Let us get a Bloomberg first-wed news update. An update on some of the top stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the blocs energy crisis. That's after Germany yielded to pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. The European Council President Charles Michelle says it sends a clear signal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5183,2022-10-21 06:21:42
16778," It is a clear sign to the market that the bloc is ready to act together. The White House has accused Tehran of sending technicians to Crimea to support Russian attacks on Ukraine with Iranian-made drones. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia must compensate his country for the destruction that has been brought by Moscow's invasion. Globo news, 20-ph, on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 100 and 20 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Alex, thank you very much. Alex Atkins in London with his first word news update. Coming up, we'll get back to one of the big market stories of the moment. The U.S. Treasury has entered their longest sustained slump in 38 years, as policy makers signal their determination to keep raising rates. More on that, laser in the show, this is Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade, and whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is gonna be slow. It's weird. A real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You got no legs. It's kind of a fun world, and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. Welcome back to Brunberg Market, Europe, half an hour, over half an hour to go to the start of trading. Let's get to another conversation about these markets. Morgan Del Don joins us global ex ETFs, head of investment strategy for Europe. Morgan, nice to have you with us. What are you watching for us? We watch the twists in terms of UK politics. What is it that's important to you about who becomes chancellor, about fiscal management of the UK economy? What is your laser focus? The next focus will be on the fiscal stance. What the UK will choose between being more accommodative on the fiscal stance or being more restrictive. Because at the end of the day, that will also be a key input for the Bank of England's decision in early November. I think if the UK decided to go for austerity, that would be very hard for the Bank of England to prescribe very high rate of ice in the coming months. With the risk of dampening growth, especially when you see demand from the retail sales, really heading down. Good morning. Good morning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5184,2022-10-21 06:26:11
16779," risk of dampening growth, especially when you see demand from the retail sales really hidden down. Good morning. So one of the questions I think many people have out here is that yes, the UK outlook is bleak. There's a risk of further austerity, but UK equity markets are already extraordinarily cheap. Do you think that they have still a lot of downside potential from here or is the risk award for an asymmetric surprise positively? I think there will be more divergence between continental Europe and UK equity markets, and this is due to the current geopolitical uncertainty. And at least, unless we get more clarity on UK's strategy to boost to growth while also mentioning inflation, I expect the UK equity is to remain challenged compared to their European counterparts. Again, what's your more global perspective on stocks and risk assets right now? It seems we're caught in a cycle where higher rates lead to risk sell-offs, and that's certainly what we saw yesterday. Is that going to continue? Well, it's interesting because I think the sentiment across investors is very pessimistic, maybe too pessimistic because when you look at US resilience, US economy resilience to these interest rates hikes, what the lesson from it is that actually corporates were kind of anticipating this increase in interest rates given that the low bays they started from. And then consumers are still strong in the US because the job market is going through a structural decline in participation rates, and that will take time before this interest rate hikes actually become restrictive and start to show in the US economy. So I do think there will be less over-admissionism towards the end of the year. Morgan, thank you so much. Morgan Del Darn, Global XETF's head of investment strategy for Europe. Thank you for joining us this morning. We are in Westminster tracking UK politics, of course, the race to find a new UK Prime Minister continues over the weekend. We will bring you thoughts shortly. This is Bloomberg. извест. My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investable universe you look at the private markets and it's you know a significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5185,2022-10-21 06:30:30
16780," You know, significantly bigger. So the question is, that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve, which is how do you bring those returns responsibly, the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors. And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. PSO now is your online home for weekly Boston Symphony Orchestra and Boston Pops performances.

Welcome back to Bloomberg Market. You're a half an hour to go until the start of cash equities trading and here are your top stories. Political chaos. The UK could have a new prime minister as soon as Monday after Liz Ross's resignation gave her the shortest premiership in British history. Stocks retreats amid high bond yields. The 10 year treasury yield holds up the highest level since the financial crisis. And unity on energy Germany agrees to join other EU countries in exploring a gas price cap as the continent's leaders tackle the looming crisis in Brussels. Welcome back to the program. Everybody half an hour to go until the start of cash equities trading. Let's have a look at where we are on the future's picture. And we've been weighed down by what happened on Wall Street by the higher yield environment, expectations of inflation on the rise. That continues to be the narrative for focus on the hawkishness of late from the Fed. And so we see futures pointing down down by half a percent on the 50 foot 100 futures tax futures down more than that as you can see, cash futures also. So that's the sort of gloomy picture then marked that confronts us at the start of the European training day. I know that gas prices are on your mind and this is one of the stories we'll return to in the another another conversation this hour. But gas and what we've heard from European leaders really important about the way they want to intervene in the market and the consensus they've managed to achieve on that subject. Yes, absolutely. It's the consensus around the gas cap from European leaders that got me looking at the market. Now, I should say that all the wisdom for this segment today comes from our gas expert Steven Stubzinski, who we frequently have the show. Any idiocy is entirely mine. So I was having a look at how much European natural gas prices have come down recently and then ask a couple of months, they're down almost 70%. It's really quite an incredible move. So is the crisis over? I think there's general narrative out there that, hey, we've already priced in the idea of Russia not providing gas anymore. We've already priced in the fact that, hey, you know, it could be a bad winter. We've priced in the negative news. It's all good from here. But no, I actually think the gas prices are botting around this level. And remember, while there are more than 70% down for the peak of a couple of months ago, they're still trading at the moment about five times the level they ever normally trade, or even five times the kind of normal peaks. So this is really quite an extraordinary level. We are still deeply in the middle of a long-term energy crisis in Europe. So what's going to change? Well, I want to show you the next chart, which is the seasonal history of gas, which is really important. And this is actually the European natural gas inventories. And the orange line is where we are this year. And this is versus the historical, five years of historical average is that kind of white line. So we are above the five-year average. It's great news. We really accelerated very, very quickly. But this is seasonal. And of course, every year, we go into the winter and we start drawing down those inventories. No, we don't know what pace, but we do know it'll definitely turn. Now, what happens is I think that when we start turning lower, which should probably come around the end of October and average, that's where we'll get more volatility in the market. Because once we start turning lower, and you know, we're no longer going to be restocking. It's only going to be drawing down those inventories. Then every bit of bad news on the climate, on anything about demand, means we'll go much, much lower. And I think that's what we're going to do.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5186,2022-10-21 06:34:45
16781," It's only going to be drawing down those inventories, then every bit of bad news on the climate, on anything about demand means we'll go much, much lower. And I think that's when we'll get the volatility return. And I think it'll be asymmetrically skewed higher. Why? Why is there a little bit of a floor here? Well, two bits of news overnight are really important. One is Asian LNG bars and buyers are back in the market that are trying to restock winter cargos because prices have fallen enough. Another sign that prices fell enough and people in the market think there's a floor out there is Yara, the massive fertilizer producer, has basically not cutting fertilizer production as much as they predicted only a little while ago because they've said gas prices have fallen enough for them to keep up operations. So therefore, in the fertilizer side and in the global LNG side, people think this is as low as they're going to get and they're piling back into the market. We're probably asymmetrically skewed for another massive spike into the winter. Yeah, really interesting analysis then and fairly gloomy forecast as to where that one goes next. Mark, thanks for that. Let's get a Bloomberg business flash, a catch up on all the corporate stories we're following today. Here's Alice. Hi, Anna. The US has said to be discussing whether it should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures including his Twitter takeover to national security reviews. This comes as officials have grown uncomfortable over what they see as the billionaires increasingly rush a friendly stance. Separately, the Washington Post reports Musk is planning to slash Twitter's workforce by 75% in the coming months. Adidas has issued a fresh profit warning as unsolved goods pile up and consumer demand weakens across China and Western markets. The German sportswear makers says it now expects an operating margin of 4% this year, down from a prior forecast of 7%. CEO Casper Roosterd has already announced he's stepping down next year. Kering has posted slower sales growth than luxury rivals LVMH and Hermes during the third quarter. The Gucci brand which accounts for more than half of Kering's revenue was held back by China's continuing COVID restrictions. Its CFO told Analyst the Italian brand's revenue from the mainland declined during the quarter and the situation there is still not back to normal. That's your Bloomberg business flash Anna. Alice, thank you. Alice Ackins in London with the business flash. Now, the UK Conservative Party is facing a race against time to fast track a leadership contest over the coming week. The chairman of the influential 1922 committee which oversees leadership contest within the party says the nomination process is only designed for serious contenders. It's a high threshold but a threshold that should be achievable by any serious candidate who has a realistic prospect of going through. A threshold of 100 members of parliament nominating a candidate obviously allows for three candidates potentially to come forward. We clearly have no say or no knowledge of who those candidates will be at this point. That was a great and Brady of the 1922 committee then. I'll bring in the conversation Alex Dawson, global council, UK country director who I should say has also worked as a special adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May and David Cameron when they were each in power. So Alex, really nice to have you with us and your expertise. I wonder what kind of, well how do you view the list of candidates in front of the Conservative Party right now? The prospect of a soon act leadership, the prospect of perhaps Boris Johnson trying to get onto the ballot which will only be maximum of three. Who do you think will be there? I think it's going to end up with Rishi Soonak versus Boris Johnson. Some people thought that Boris Johnson wouldn't quite be able to muster up the 100 signatures. I think it's probably slightly less in question than Rishi Soonak. I suspect that it's going to be relatively difficult for Penny Mordent to get to that set of figures. I think if you do end up with Rishi Soonak versus Boris Johnson, you end up with two credible people who can do the job, even if you may not agree with the substance of what they do in the role. I think there is a very, very good basis for having this threshold of nominations. I think there was too much of a risk of having a total outside of Canada come through who just wasn't up for the big time, which is unfortunately how we saw it with Liz Truss.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5187,2022-10-21 06:39:02
16782," having a total outside of Canada come through who just wasn't up for the big time, which is unfortunately how we saw it with Liz Truss. Good morning Alex. You think it'll be Rishi Sunak versus Boris Johnson of the most likely scenario there. What do you think that will mean for the Chancellor? Do you think Jeremy Hunt will stay in the job? And if you were Chancellor, what policies would you change to stimulate growth and turn around the UK's fortunes now? So I think that I think there is a very good reason to believe that if Rishi Sunak won, you'd end up with Jeremy Hunt staying on. I suspect it will be more difficult for Boris Johnson to swallow that if he became Prime Minister. And the struggle is going to be that he's got to find someone who is equally credible and sort of equally anti-Johnsonite to be the Chancellor in that circumstance because the markets are sort of on the sniff for any scent that the UK is not credible when it comes to fiscal consolidation, getting its entire sort of work back under control back together. And that's going to be a serious challenge I think for Boris Johnson considering how he's associated with. Now in terms of what policies can be used to stimulate growth, well, firstly, sort of demonstrating a bit of fiscal competence, stopping the pound sliding, maybe seeing the pound restore itself in a bit of value will probably make it a little bit more of an attractive prospect for investors. I think holding the perception of shambles that is coming out to the UK at the moment will be quite valuable. We have colleagues overseas who are saying that a lot of investors in the UK at the moment are just kind of questioning about future decisions that they're making. So I think there's kind of a lot of early work that could be done with that and then actually it is looking about how you further embed those incentives to invest in the economy. Now that though is going to be very difficult when you have a corporation's act rate of 25%. Alex, the way you describe it, the markets might, and we actually heard from a guilt, some of the operates in the guilt market yesterday that they thought a quick coronation, if you like, of Rishi Sunak could be actually quite risk positive, could be taken well by markets. And the way you describe it, there would be continuity, perhaps at number 11, then as well with Jeremy Hunt saying on as Chancellor, do you think that MPs will be thinking in terms of volatility, no volatility in financial markets as they make their choices, as they look ahead and decide who they want to lead the country? That's not typically the kind of factor they want to put front and center in a decision like this, but do you think they might do this time around? I mean, yes, I think it's going to be more of an issue for them than it was when they voted, when they got put through Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, you know, the bearish margins into the final round last time. However, I wouldn't overestimate MPs' attention and care that they pay to financial markets, unfortunately. I think what they will be thinking about is the polling, they'll be thinking about who can help me perhaps hold my seat at the next election. Now, obviously, you know, part of that is who's going to resolve the economic sort of chaos that we've been seeing over the last few months. But some of that is also going to be about, well, you know, sniff test, it's going to be difficult for Rishi Sunak to campaign around the country and he's a bit sort of technocratic and he's been of a, you know, whereas Boris Johnson, he's sort of tried and trusted when it comes with winning elections against the odds. And they may well think, you know, Johnson's worth kind of going back to you again, even if it does best and considerable political and economic risks. Alex, one of the things I'm really struggling with is how this turns out well for the Conservative Party going into the next general election, in the context that whichever candidate it is, the party right now is way behind in the polls, just massively behind the polls and also in that context, never mind the leader what they do, they have their hands tied, it's not going to be the fault of necessarily the next leader. The country isn't a very, very bad state fundamentally and it's going to get tougher next year, they can't do much about it. So where is the good news going to come for the Conservative Party, no matter which leader it is? Well, I think if you see an end to the chaos and an end to the immediate sort of series of questions of people like me on shows like this about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5188,2022-10-21 06:43:22
16783," I think if you see an end to the chaos and an end to the immediate sort of series of questions of people like me on shows like this about, you know, the UK that may well be a little bit of an upside and that type of upside is the thing that may well help them save their seats. But I mean, I think a lot of them are frankly consigned to the fact that or resigned to the fact that we're quite likely to have a keyestarmer government from 2024 onwards. And what they're aim and ambition is is making sure that they are not in such a bad place economically that they could kind of bounce back again five years after that. But yeah, I mean, at the moment they're playing a losing hand and I think that's kind of recognised by the fact that they pushed out a prime minister after 44 days. There's no sort of sense of the core more dignity there. They rush to the exits. And I think that shows that they are a party that is still very ruthless and focused on winning. Right. Yeah, we'll see some of that over the weekend, those out. Alex, we have heard from many economists and Bloomberg economics certainly amongst them, estimating that there's still a more than 20 billion pounds hole in the fiscal story for the UK because of the mini budget. And that still needs to be fixed. The Chancellor, we know it's going to be speaking to leaders of certain banks, certainly Jamie Diamond, of JP Morgan is going to be talking to the Chancellor next week. Do you think the banking sector is going to be one place that a Chancellor will be tempted to go to try and shore up revenues? Yeah, unfortunately, financial services never at the top of politicians lists of people to thank and protect. I suspect though that the the challenge will be that it's going to be very difficult for companies to allocate capital to the UK if they're going to be taxed 33% on the profit. And there is still an argument for competitiveness and the UK being ranked broadly in the middle when it comes to cooperation tax for a number of issues. So I do see there being the possibility of the surcharge coming down, but it's going to require some banks to kind of make some quite emotional and intelligent pitches to the government as to why that should happen. So they need to be thinking quite carefully about that. But fundamentally, the UK relies on financial services, it needs a strong financial services sector and any chance there will be a full-tower of the look back. Okay, Alex, thank you so much. Thanks for joining us, Alex Dawson, Global Council, UK Country Director. Thanks for bringing us your expertise in politics and indeed advising business on politics.

Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe we still have 30 minutes until the start of cash equities trading. The future picture looks pretty negative looking to catch up with losses yesterday on Wall Street. In fact though some of these futures off earlier lows. Let's get back to some politics but take a more pan-European look at things. Liz Trust has quit as prime minister as we know as we've said a number of times. Here's how the French president Emmanuel Macron responded. France as a nation and friend of the British people above all wants stability, especially in the current context. The US is in a context of war of energy crisis is important that the United Kingdom regains political stability very quickly. The focus on stability there for President Macron for more on the European reaction to the political chaos in the UK. And other matters that European leaders have been discussing. Let's speak now to Bloomberg's Maria today. How are European leaders then what's their view on the turmoil once again after the most recent turmoil here in the UK? I was a reporter in fact that shouted that question at President Macron. How do you react to this chaos in the United Kingdom? The fact that Liz Trust is gone, you blink and you'll miss her. Are you sad by the fact that she has now left number 10 and in his response. It was very short and I guess to the point he told me I am sad to see her go the way you would quote see any colleague go. There's not a lot of emotion but the reality Anna is that she was barely in office. So she didn't really have time to bond with any of this European leaders. She only had a single bilateral meeting with the French for a lot of the rest of the EU 27 countries. There was no FaceTime. That is a reality. And by the way she never even made it to Brussels. Remember there was some expectation as to whether she would come here and meet with the head of the commission. That meeting, well, she was just in office for too little time for the meeting to manifest. So I guess the lack of reaction perhaps emotion response to that but the message that officially and also behind the scenes. I've heard a lot over the past 48 hours is that well the fiscal political experiments at a time of crisis may not be a good idea. And this could be a lesson even a warning for the Europeans as they debate their own fiscal response going into the winter. Good morning Maria. Meanwhile in Brussels some slightly longer lasting leaders were staying late into the night to find you reach an agreement over energy. How significant is this? Well, very late into the night because his agreement was reached at 245 in the morning and I wouldn't know because my phone went off at that time. So when you look at the deal that was agreed yesterday, this is a political go ahead to the proposal that was put forward by the commission. It does include that price cap which they call now and it makes it even. We're trickier for me to explain what this is. It's a temporary dynamic price corridor to avoid price volatility in the gas market. Essentially it's a limit up transaction halted when you see a day of big volatility in the TTF, the Dutch benchmark. They also agreed to the joint purchases and of course building the storage together going forward into the next heating season. The reality is however the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5190,2022-10-21 06:52:06
16785," and the next meeting season. The reality is that the mechanism in terms of how to implement it is still very much up in the air. I hear this needs at least two to three weeks before they can define how to implement the tools they agreed. Okay, a temporary dynamic price corridor. Thank you very much. Springbacks Maria today with the latest on what has been agreed to be the next at least at high level in Brussels and Germany. Caving to pressure from elsewhere in the EU it would seem. We will get back to your stocks to watch including in the auto space. We will talk about Renault and why the car maker missed its revenue forecast in the third quarter. More on that and other stocks in focus this morning. Your taxpayer team this morning and There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to the next zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, we will get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market. We still have just under 10 minutes to go until the start of trading here in Europe. The future picture looks pretty negative. You're a socks 50 futures down by 8 tenths of a percent. Let's get to the individual socks we're watching. Danny Berger joins us with a breakdown. Danny, good morning. You're nice and warm in the studio. It's not too cold actually here in Westminster. But anyway, let's get back to the matter of the markets. Renault and the auto stocks. What's in focus? First, let me say you know I complain almost every morning that I'm cold in this office. So I don't know. We might be the same temperature. I would love a scarf right now. Anyway, back to the more important matters. Renault earnings came out this morning pretty much in line for their third quarter revenue. So they did see revenue climb sales of a lot of their EV vehicles. Now they still did cite some supply chain issues. The semiconductor shortage hitting them as well, but they confirmed their 2022 outlook. Just reading through some of the analysts notes, it just really sounds like people have a lot of questions for this earnings call. Be it build up of inventories or just this general macroeconomic environment. Danny, good morning. Deutsche Bank. You're also looking out. What's the story there? Yeah, so late last night, a report from Bloomberg, a person familiar telling us that Deutsche Bank is set to cut dozens of folks of its staff from its advisory business from its origination and advisory business, basically just reflecting the difficulty in this deal environment and IPOs that's been drying up as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5191,2022-10-21 06:56:36

Okay, a focus on toys bank next week now, Adidas. I'm sure we've already heard from some companies in this sector about the challenges they face. What's the Adidas story? Yeah, Adidas just a lot of build up of inventory. Anna, you have China not buying as much Western countries not buying as much. It all goes back to this concern about the consumer and whether they will be spending. Danny, thanks so much. Moomba, Sunny burger joining us there with the stocks to watch. Mark Cudmore of course in Singapore. Thanks to Mark as well. Just a few minutes ago then until the start of the European equity trading session, the future picture looks negative. Markets shaken by higher expectations of inflation renewed focus on higher interest rates, higher yield on treasuries. That really the preoccupation of markets as well of course as UK politics. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play. And maybe even more. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg.

16787," European headquarters in the city of London. Here are your top stories, political chaos. Liz Truss resigns after just 44 days. It's the shortest premiership in British history. The race for number 10. Richie Sunack and Penny Morden lead the pack, but some MPs call for the return of former leader Boris Johnson. Plus, Hawke's batter market stock sink and yield spike as swaps pricing a 5% peak in the Fed terminal rates. Let's check in then on these futures as we square up, of course, to another major day for UK politics and a reminder of the economic fragility. Retail sales coming in softer than expected and a bigger jump in Boringress for the month of September for the British government. As we await, of course, those contenders to come through, we could get a new Prime Minister as soon as Monday. The deadline is the 28th. The FTSE 100 currently opening down a 10th of a percent as we set in the headlines, markets now starting to price in a higher terminal rate. Certainly the swaps markets, you had the fully fed President coming out saying, we're going to be well above 4% by the end of this year. FTSE 100 currently down 3.10 of a percent will continue to keep an eye on European markets, of course, in light of the decision and the agreement around addressing the energy crisis, the Germans giving back a little bit of wiggle room as the European Union comes together on some kind of response. The Spanish I've x currently down 8.10 of percent. FTSE now lower by 36 points. And over in France, the Cacahont off by 64 points down by 1%. Let's switch it over and see how things are playing out there and given the losses that we store on Wall Street yesterday. It was a mixed picture for earnings, but really the driver of that sentiment was the end of the day where these more hawkish comments from fed officials like the fully fed President again, a swap trade has priced in now 5% for the terminal rate by the first half of next year. Future state side points into losses of 3.10 of a percent and the sell-off in bonds now, the longest route that we've seen in 38 years. That takes you back to Paul Volker and the fight of inflation, of course, back in the 1980s. 4.25 on the 10-year, that's a move higher by close to three basis points, so continuing to grind higher US yields. 135 is what you're getting across the Bloomberg dollar and it's that strengthening by 2.10 of a percent. Again, feeding into the risk of sentiment that we're seeing in the session today, Brent, $92 a brow, that's a move lower by 4.10 of 8%. Let's get out to Francine Lackwether, who's outside the House of Parliament again, such a crucial take as ever for UK politics. We keep talking about the history-making moves that we're seeing in terms of the political machinations, a new Prime Minister, of course, that race for the next premiership. And I love the fact that we've sent our resident Italian down to the House of Parliament to discuss the Italianification of British politics. We have a connection issue, but we're going to reestablish it, of course, the importance of having Francine outside the House of Parliament. I also have a podcast called in the city. So you see, there's so many foreigners in London, and of course, some of them, including me, vote, that it's maybe a good idea to look at what happens in the UK in the future, given a lot of investors worldwide, or were invested in the UK. So three main questions here, is this a new conservative party that's less about ideology, but also a lot more about pragmatism? So we found out the rules yesterday on how they will vote. It's very unlikely that they're more than, actually, it's impossible, that there are more than three MPs are going to go through the round of voting, and it's quite likely, actually, that will end up with a new Prime Minister on Monday. Now, this is extremely important for the markets. The one question they have is, do we have that Halloween budget on the 31st of October? Is that when we still find out the fiscal plans? Now, the timing of that is extremely important, as you well know, Tom, because then on the third of newspaper reporting that it is unlikely to hold, as you say, the importance of course of the OBR, and then the BOE decision come November 3rd. Okay, so the UK has been planished into a fresh political crisis, following the resignation of its shortest serving Prime Minister, her chaotic 44-day tenure, saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts, but of course, before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Here's what happened then after the lectern was placed outside number 10. I recognise, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. Okay, let's take a look at some of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5193,2022-10-21 07:05:45
16788," Today's front page is then the Daily Mail focuses on the fight for the soul of the Conservative Party. Boris vs. Rishi is the battle that that paper expects. The Metro decries, Truss as the worst Prime Minister Britain has ever had. He couldn't, could he? Asked the Daily Express of the possible Johnson return to number 10. We know he changes travel plans to come back to the UK. The bitter end is all the Guardian has to say after 44 days of live trust. The mirror echoes leaders of opposition parties and calling for a general election with a big cap. Now of course. And the letters, we can't forget the letters. The letters makes an appearance on the Daily Stars front page fresh from that live streamed victory over the PM. There we go. That's the one to end on really. Joining us now is Stuart Wallace, Bloomberg's new director for Amir. And of course, Christine Aquino from our markets team to run us through the key themes. Let's start, let's do it on where things stand in terms of the leadership context. Could we get a Prime Minister by the end of play Monday? Yeah. How are things shaping up? Yeah, it's going to be Friday at the latest and there's something bizarre happens more likely Monday. What seems to be happening is that they will try in a very diplomatic way to keep the party membership out of that vote. Because I think the lesson they learned from the last time round, number one, it went on far too long and markets didn't like that. And number two, you ended up with a candidate, well, he lasted 44 days and pretty much crashed the economy in the process. So I think this time around they're going to take it perhaps slightly faster and perhaps go for a candidate that would A can attempt to unify the party, but also will appeal to the markets because fundamentally any government coming in needs money and that's what the markets are for. Christine, good morning from Westminster. The question that markets want to know is of course whether the, you know, we can have this chancellor knowing that we are not sure whether he stays in power or not. We have that fiscal statement on October 31st. What happens? How do markets interpret whether, you know, this gets delayed? Well, Francine, I think yeah, the delay potentially would be something that markets will definitely be watching out for. I have to say though, I think the reaction in markets a yesterday was relatively calm. All things considered and that is because despite the turmoil that Liss Trust herself was facing, at the moment we do not have any indication of Jeremy Hunt as chancellor leaving that post. And so there is that sense of continuity there and we know of course that Hunt being placed in the position of chancellor was very instrumental to pacifying markets after several weeks of turmoil. So I think that is giving a bit of relief to investors at the moment. But of course, questions hanging in the balance. Will we get that budget, that full fiscal picture on the 31st of October, but also more importantly, what would a new Prime Minister mean for Jeremy Hunt's agenda as chancellor? Will he be able to continue on the path that he set out, which was very reassuring to markets in the first place? Now they're going to be looking for him to deliver. Yeah, in the South of the UK assets back at the forefront today, the pound is down 5 cents of 8 percent and there's a cell of across gilts as well. So I'm just trying to ask Stuart, just tying in to that comment there from Christine. In terms of the practicalities of the current chancellor working through with ministries to push through what they're expected to be pretty significant cuts, when the heads of those ministries don't even know if they're going to be in their positions. When the new Prime Minister is installed, the likelihood surely is that this statement is going to have to be pushed back. We brace ourselves further market volatility. Yes, I think that's absolutely right. I cannot see a scenario where it makes sense to produce this statement on October 31st. Partly for all the reasons you laid out, but partly also because we don't know what that's going to look like in two weeks from now. It's too far off and then that poses an incredibly big problem for the Bank of England. How does it react to something it hasn't seen and probably won't see for some time? We'll see what happens, but at the moment I would not put any money on there being a fiscal statement on October 31st. Christine, what does that mean? How does that tie the Bank of England and actually their QT program on November 3rd with that NPC? Well, friends, I think it's going to be another communication challenge for the Bank of England after a series of challenges on that front already. I think they're just going to have to navigate what we're going to be seeing from the government, whether that 31st fiscal statement is going to proceed and what they're going to be doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5194,2022-10-21 07:09:55
16789," On that front already, I think they're just going to have to navigate what we're going to be seeing from the government, whether that 31st fiscal statement is going to proceed and what they're going to be doing from that. I really will boil down to what we hear from Governor Andrew Bailey and the rest of his colleagues in terms of, again, reassuring markets, because this is what investors are looking to at the moment, despite the political turmoil in terms of the new prime minister, they want to see that the institutions of government and policy making are still very much intact. So it's going to be very key what we hear from Andrew Bailey following if we do in fact get the delay to the fiscal statement. All right. Thank you both for joining us. Stuart Wallace, our Bloomberg's at news director for EMEA and Christine Aquino, of course, looking at the markets from our live team.

Now, this is what we know, the tumultuous market reaction, including a plunging pound, forced her hand when she's sack-quarting her closest political ally.

16790," Just political ally. Since then it has felt like a matter of when not if she would go. Now we're delighted to bring in someone with experience in number 11 Downing Street, the former UK Chancellor of Philip Hammond. Thank you for training us, Mr Hammond. When you look at, first of all, what happens to growth? What is the right prescription for this country now to grow and be more stable after the tumultuous 44 days? Well, clearly the most important thing at the moment is to calm the markets. We've seen the power of the markets over the last few weeks. I think Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was getting on top of that, putting together a package that would have been reassuring to the markets on 31st of October. Clearly what we mustn't do now is anything which signals to the markets more chaos, instability and uncertainty ahead. Then the new government has got to outline a clear growth plan. Liz Truss' growth plan was based on a single proposition. You cut taxes through by borrowing and somehow that magically delivers you growth. Doesn't matter whether that's credible or not credible anymore because clearly the markets are not going to allow it. So there needs to be an alternative growth plan. How does Britain earn its living in the post-Brexit post-COVID? Post-energy crisis. Well, my own view is we've got to be prepared to take a few risks. We've got to articulate, for example, a role for the city of London for the financial services industry, which is this country's most important single industry. That may mean being prepared to take some calculated risks as we put Britain in the lead in areas of new technology, new trading techniques, new products. But I don't think Britain has the option of simply sitting back, relaxing and hoping that the world will deliver it a living. Indeed, and we had reminders from the data that came through Mr Hammond this morning around retail sales and around the additional borrowing in the month of September that the strains on this economy. When it comes to your assessment, though, of the likelihood of a fiscal plan being published and announced as the Chancellor's hoped by the end of this month, the reporting from the Times and our own assessment for our team is that's looking unlikely. Would you concur with that view and what do you expect the market reaction to be to that if it gets delayed? Well, I think it depends whether the Chancellor is replaced. If a new Chancellor is appointed, clearly he or she will want a period of time to look at the package. If the new incoming Prime Minister decides to confirm Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor, then I see no reason why he couldn't go ahead and deliver the package on the 31st of October. He's obviously been working on it since he's been in office. How will the Conservative Party change now? It does feel like, because of the voting rules, could we have a Prime Minister on Monday and as that pragmatism, you know, ahead of ideology? Well, we clearly could have a new leader, a new Prime Minister on Monday. If only one candidate passes the nomination hurdle, the 1922 Committee has sent. But look, what I think is clear is that the rules that we currently have, which have a two-stage process where the MPs select two candidates nominally and then the members vote, that isn't working. It hasn't delivered the results we want. By the way, nor does the Labour Party's methodology for electing a leader work. It's not served them well over the last decade or so. So I think both parties need to look at how we do this and make sure that we have a leadership election methodology that's fit and proper for the 21st century. Who's the right person to lead this country? Well, I'm not going to say until I know who the lineup of candidates is, who I think would be the person who will most effectively deliver stability. What I will say is that I don't think going back into the past and re-incarnating a previous Prime Minister is going to be any way to reassure markets. Okay, so that rolls out Boris Johnson, of course. I'm in the speculation and reporting that the former Prime Minister is on his way back, potentially, through his hat in the ring. There is a strong case. Isn't there for a general election at this point? Well, there will be siren calls for a general election. The Labour Party is obviously emboldened by the power results that it's seeing. There will be plenty of people in the country who feel that they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5196,2022-10-21 07:18:36

Sources say the US is looking into new export controls that would limit China's access to powerful emerging computing technologies. We're told the potential plans focus on the still experimental field of quantum computing and artificial intelligence software. Global News, 20 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, power by more than 1,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Tom Francine. Thanks so much, Alessadekins. In London, coming up, we'll have a full round-up of inflation. The potential rules be speaking to the Royal Chief Executive Officer Nikola Vieronimus. Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third-party apps in the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

16794," Welcome back to the open everyone 30 minutes into the We start here at Westminster political chaos. Liz Truss it rains. Well, Tom, you take over. Yes, Liz Truss resigned. We have a few connection issues that happens in live TV. The Prime Minister resigning after 44 days. The focus now on who he's going to take over. Rishi Sunak or Penny Mauden lead the pack. The sum MPs call for the return of former leader Boris Johnson. Plus Hawks, battered markets, European stocks fall as US yields spike and swaps Pricing a 5% peak in the Fed terminal rate. That is playing into these markets. It's certainly played into the pessimism across European equities yesterday towards the Close. Of course, the commentary, the hawkish commentary from Fed officials, the fully fed president saying he sees at least 4% by the end of this year, Swaps trade is now pricing in a terminal rate as we said in the headlines of 5% From the Fed by the first half of 2023. The markets here in Europe lower by 7 cents of 8% the DAX over in Germany, Off by 101 points down by 8 cents of 8% and the FTSE 100 here in the UK down 2 cents of 8% of course we continue to zero in on UK assets given the political chaos That continues here in the UK just 2 sectors in the green real estate up 4% of Percent health care, one of those defensive sectors just cleaning on to gains Everything else in the red, but on the list is retail down almost 3% Construction and consumer products also lower by between 1 and 1 half and 2%. So the sell off here on the back of a day of pessimism despite mixed earnings Yesterday in the US talking of earnings let's get to one of the biggest companies Dezero in on particularly in the European space. They are lower today they last on my check off about 4% on concerns that some Shoppers seem to be trading down to cheaper make up and skincare products as Soaring inflation starts to bite but the French cosmetics giant sales rose by 9.1% on a comparable basis beating forecasts very pleased to say we can now Bring in Laureus CEO Nicola Renomis. Nicola thank you for joining us. It was a beat on the top line. So the question from a number of analysts then is whether or not you see this trade Down to the cheaper components within your portfolio continuing or is this going to be short lived? Well hello and nice to be with you. First of all I have to say that I'm very pleased to report that the beauty market as Announced in previous calls continues to be very dynamic at the global level and it was 6% at the end of June and remains at plus 6% at the end of September with a slight Rebalancing between volume and value but overall the appetite of consumers for beauty remains Very strong. For a straight down is concerned we haven't seen any major shift probably the only Country where we've seen a little bit of changing some consumer behaviors is in the UK Where the inflation is the highest and it has really only affected the skin care category Whilst hair care is going up and fragrance sales are soaring so we see consumers Wanting to indulge themselves and we have to remind that beauty is a very affordable treat And what is very important finally in the spirit of purchasing power attention is that people do not want to compromise on quality And the fact that loyal keeps on growing at twice the speed of the market and gaining share including in the United Kingdom means that consumers are voting for the best quality products which is what we provide But Mr. Yohan is first of all good morning from Westminster your share price is down to 5% Are you worried that you're not able to protect your margins given higher inflation? Well as we have said that in the in the call we did yesterday we are confident that once again this year We are going to be able to grow our top line to beat the market and to deliver margin improvement This is what loyal have been doing year on year for the last 20 years and we will continue to do it this year Because we have pricing power all our innovations and we have innovations that are extremely successful in all divisions Our launch at a higher price point and at a higher growth margin level We have a lot of flexibility in our PNL with our inputs being managed with our...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5200,2022-10-21 07:35:50
16795," pushed at a higher price point and at a higher growth margin level. We have a lot of flexibility in our PNL with our inputs being managed, with our SGA being managed and we are confident that we will continue to deliver margin improvement. The APEC region accounts for at least 35% of your revenues. I wanted to get your views on what's happening in China, the lockdowns, expected to continue. How much of a drag do you expect that to be in the quarters ahead for the business? Well, it's clear that China is a bit of an unpredictable market right now. You know, mid to long term, it remains a safe bet because it's a market where demographics, purchasing power are going to play in our favor. But short term, we've had, we say, an expected lockdown, the additional lockdowns in August, which has not prevented us from growing. We have grown in our sell-out ourselves on the Chinese market, have grown by close to 8% if you've had the domestic market in the JT3 island of Hainan. So we can grow on this market. But it's true that we are happy that we have started this very successful, what I call rebalancing strategy in between regions. And if you look at our nine-month results, you would see that Europe is our biggest region with over 8 billion euros at nine months. Then we have Asia at 8 million and North America at 7.5. So we have three big regions that are of the same size. So we can offset any difficulty in one part, which is growth in another. And finally, on regions, we are flying in emerging markets at plus 23, which remains a big growth. So reservoir for morale. And you could, I know you've pushed back against this idea that actually shoppers are trading down into cheaper brands, even some of your own cheaper brands. But would you consider, as we get into the winter months, either having lines that are a little bit less costly than some of them are now, even just cutting prices on certain products? No, we don't need to cut prices. You know, that has never worked in the past. People want quality. We have a wide portfolio of brands. You know, our price points start with Shambu, that's three euros, and they go up to skin care luxury creams at 400 euros. So there is, in the L'Oreal brand portfolios, there are products at every price points. But we will never sacrifice quality. We invest in quality. Of course, retailers will probably promote some of the brands, but we do not intend to launch a cheaper price product. On the contrary, we intend to bring beautiful, tempting innovations for consumers. We will want to afford the best of beauty. Just looking at the balance sheet, Nicola, I see the free cash flow has been edging up in previous years. That continues. You do have total debt of about 8 billion euros, more than double the debt levels in 2020. Are you comfortable with these levels, particularly as financing costs edge up? You know, L'Oreal is generating a lot of cash every year. As you know, we have a high-grow smart gin. We have a very dynamic business. And every year, we are generating a significant amount of cash. So debt is not a concern for us. And, you know, L'Oreal is very well rated by all the financial institutions in the world. So we have absolutely no issue to raise money. Should we need to do it? And we don't. All right. Thank you so much for giving us a good of your time today. Nicola, Yehren and I just, and we hope to see you in London very soon. The Chief Executive there of L'Oreal. Coming up, we'll look at the runners and riders and the race to follow this truss as UK Prime Minister. And weather borne's Johnson could actually make a comeback. Does he have the numbers?

16796," There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to nexerotargetes. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put Lexus Cionna grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking what's the point of having her at the top. In the strong dollar, apple fly the world's risks of instability. She didn't things that complete reunification must be realized. Welcome back to the Open 41 minutes into your European training day. Losses of 7 cents of a percent across the benchmark, futures turning lower as well on the S&P E-Mini's now-statt futures lower by 3.10 of a percent. And the sell-off in guilt continues the pound, also under pressure down at 3.10 of a percent. But pairing some of the heavy losses currently training at 1.12. Frenzy. Now this Truss has resigned as Prime Minister of the UK, let's recap her timeline. So it's been a pretty incredible three weeks. September 5th, she wins the leadership contest on the eighth. She announced her energy support package. The mini budget on the 23rd followed the Queen's funeral. Her first tax cut reversal came on the 3rd of October as succession of uterines followed, culminating in the sacking of her chancellor, the ousting of her home secretary, and ultimately 44 days later her own resignation. Now for more on all of this, we're joined by our UK government to report to Emily Ashton, Emily, great to have you on the program. So what exactly is the process now to replace Truss from here? Well, it's a very short process compared to this huge, really long leadership contest that we saw over the summer that lasted over six weeks. This time they want a much more accelerated contest. So we're going to see by Monday the final two candidates and maybe by Monday, even you might even just have the leader in place. That's how fast it could all be. But to get to that point, the threshold is high and candidates are going to need 100 nominations. That's compared to 20 over the summer. They want only the most, the people with the most support to go for it. So at the moment, we don't quite know who's going to throw that hat on the ring, but we know that MPs are taking soundings from MPs, whether they can reach that 100 limit. Yeah, Emily, you're obviously brilliantly plugged in to all things UK politics and to MPs and their assessments of what is going on. What is your take? What are they saying about who is most like at this point, at least, to take over? Well, you know, you can see those three on screen. Now, you know, British, you see that, Penny Morden, Boris Johnson, those are the three big names that people are talking about. Then what is maybe he hasn't said whether he will yet or not. But Richie, you know, let's remember, you know, he came second in that contest over the summer, but he crucially had the most support from MPs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5202,2022-10-21 07:44:28
16797," said whether he will yet or not. But Rishi Srinak, let's remember, he came second in that contest over the summer, but he crucially had the most support from NPEs. It was the members that didn't prefer him over Liz Truss, which could be a bit of a sticking point because to impose somebody who hasn't got the support to the membership might be a bit tricky, but we know that a lot of NPEs are coming forward now and supporting Rishi Srinak out, right? And they say he clearly is the man to be. But in an extraordinary twist, you see that Boris Johnson is now coming forward as well. He's been on holiday in the Caribbean. He's flying back. He's taking the soundings as to whether he can make that 100 NPE threshold, but crucially, whether he can win, because I don't think he would really go for it if he didn't think he could become the next leader. That really would be such a remarkable twist, wouldn't it? So we follow obviously the machinations around Boris Johnson very closely. Thank you, as ever to our UK government reporter Emily Ashton for the latest on the runnings to take over as PM. Let's bring in now Anand Menon, who is the director of UK in, we'll get the title, but Anand Menon, who is a watcher of all things UK politics and really a reader of the tea leaves. Anand, fantastic to get you on, director of UK in change in Europe, King's College. There you go, the titles come up. Thanks, Anand. What is your assessment of where things stand in this race? We saw the odds up on screen just a minute ago. Where do you think things stand? Do you think Boris Johnson really has a decent shot at this? I mean, yes. I mean, the first thing we've got to do is caveat this by saying that actually no one I don't think has yet declared themselves to be a candidate. So there's front expectation around people who haven't actually said they want the job, but it certainly looks at the moment far more likely than it did last night that Boris Johnson could get to that 100 vote threshold. And I think it's hard to see him losing if he gets through to the members vote. So Boris Johnson's a serious contender. But Anand, when you look at the numbers, I mean yesterday we were talking about Boris Johnson partially getting 30 votes from MPs, right? They need that 100 threshold. You really think it can get 100 people to vote for him in Parliament? The honest answer is I don't know. I certainly think it's possible, though. And remember, a whole load of MPs haven't yet declared. These candidates are going to be working the phones frantically over the weekend. There's an awful lot of Tory MPs who haven't revealed who they'll be voting for yet. So there are a lot of votes to play for. And he's already sort of high 30s, early 40s, then he's well on the way. I don't think it's a given. I don't think it's a definite. And I think one of the things we're seeing in the Conservative Party at the moment is some MPs threatening to resign the whip and even call by elections should Boris Johnson come back. And over the weekend, I think there are going to be a lot of fraught conversations between Boris backers and people who will not accept him under any circumstances. Does the Conservative Party ultimately survive this, Anand? Well, I think so because the Conservative Party has a knack of surviving everything. It is just a remarkably adaptable political party. Whether your question means does the Conservative Party win the next election? It is very hard to see them doing so. And this is quite interesting when it comes to Boris Johnson listening to MPs being interviewed last night. A lot of them were arguing they should have Johnson back because he's an electoral asset. MPs got rid of Boris Johnson only a few months ago partly because he was seen as an electoral liability. He was losing by elections he should have been winning. So the evidence simply isn't there that Boris Johnson could take them to victory in an election. That being said, an election is probably going to be two years away. Yeah, but Anand, so in the next two years, there's a lot going on. Do you have inflation, you have bankvang then you have merges going up. A lot of people could be much worse off in six months than they were a year ago. How does the next government make sure that this country grows? What's the prescription for growth? Well, I think partly that depends on who gets elected because the one thing was trust short as showed us is there is a range of opinion within the Conservative Party. I think Boris Johnson in number 10 would have probably slightly different economic priorities to Rishi Sunak in number 10. But I think the hope in Conservative High Commanders got to be that yeah, things aren't going to look good in the spring or summer of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5203,2022-10-21 07:48:50

Spice Jet 737 Max aircraft. Spice Jet 737 Max aircraft. Welcome back to the Open 53 minutes into the European trading day. The sell-off across European equities is accelerating. Currently the benchmark down. More than 1% futures in the US also lower by between 3.10 and 5.10 on the Nasdaq futures. The bond sale of continues the dollar strengthens a tenth of 8%. Let's get to the corporate stories then. This is one that is absolutely fascinating and brutal for employees of Twitter. The Eelon Musk plans to cut nearly 75% of Twitter's workforce. Yes, 75% as part of his takeover. As talks progress and they are progressing, advisors are working to get the $44 billion deal closed by the end of the month. Is Bloomberg Quick Takes Alex Webb? Alex took us through the latest. This 75% cut that's being reported. How is that even possible for a company like Twitter? 7,500 people. That would take it down to something in the order of 2000. The strange thing is that in Silicon Valley, this isn't a particularly new idea. I was there for about a month in July and I met quite a few people who said Twitter has far too many people. They need to pair that right down. You could fire two-thirds of them. That's literally what people were saying to me. Does that mean that Twitter could have a lot of problems if it does? Yes, absolutely. But it is in some parts of Silicon Valley, the orthodoxy that Twitter is overstaffed given what it does. He isn't necessarily coming up with something massively new. How you execute that could be a real problem. If it affects things like content moderation, security, that is a real issue that has broad ramifications for public discourse around the world. Absolutely. Is this about looking to clear out the old team and put in new staff? Is that potentially partly what he's looking at? It could well be. It's the private X2 model. You take something private. You look at all the things you don't need. You get rid of that. Let's start from scratch and build it up again. You've got a bare mind that Elon is probably tapping much of his readily accessible capital to do this deal. Therefore, he's got to find a way of making it profitable in order to start paying the bills. Does that mean that in a few years' time it starts to think about going public again? That's the private X2 model. Maybe. Perhaps he can think about repaying some of the money. How is the deal progressing? It is getting closer. We're hearing that the conversations between bankers are accelerating. The banks on both sides. They're trying to make it close by the end of the month. There is a bit of a fly in the ointment. There are colleagues in the US reporting that the US is considering some security reviews of Elon's ventures as a whole.

Plus, Hawks, batter markets, while European stocks fall, as U.S. yields spike and swamps price in a 5% peak in the Fed terminal rate. So good morning everyone, quite a lot going on, so we're here at West Minister of the UK. Once again, plunged into a fresh political crisis following the resignation of its shortest serving Prime Minister. Now here's what's happened after the lectern was placed outside number 10. I recognise though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. Well, let's bring in Bloomberg's Alex Wickham. Alex, you know everyone at West Minister, I know you have sources on, well, across the aisle, who's the next Prime Minister? That is the question. At the moment, we see these spreadsheets of Tory MP nominations for each candidate. At the moment, Boris Johnson and Rishi Suneak are the two front runners. Heavy caveat there though. We are pretty sure Rishi Suneak is going to run. We aren't sure yet that Boris Johnson is going to run. He is clearly canvassing support, he's trying to work out whether there is a path to victory for him and whether that is a tall plausible. That's the key question really over the next 48 hours over the weekend, really, before the nomination deadline ends on Monday. Then there's Penny Morden, is probably the third candidate who does have the realistic chance of getting to that 100 key 100 number that gets you on the ballot. So Alex, give me a sense, first of all, Boris Johnson, he needs to get 100 MPs to vote for him. So do we find out tomorrow, who's likely, I mean, what's happening right now? Do the candidates and no one has said, has put really themselves forward, but do they call MPs to try and muster support to look to see if they have the numbers before we have officially their names? Yes, exactly. So actually no MP, no candidate has declared yet and said, yes, I'm running for Prime Minister. No one wants to sort of jump to the gun and be seen as, you know, been plotting in the background over the last few days of this trust. However, behind the scenes, the Westminster, those are the conversations that are going on text message on phone calls between people like Boris Johnson and Rishi Suneak, people around these candidates. They're their advisors, their MP supporters, ringing around MPs to try to work out whether they realistically can get to that magic 100 number. If they can't, they may not decide to stand. We've already seen a couple of the lower profile candidates, the likes of Grant Shaps, the new home secretary. He said that he won't be standing. He was definitely thinking about it. He had his having conversations with MPs and I think it was clear to him that 100 MPs was an unrealistic target for him and so he decided not to stand. That's the key question for these candidates right now and this will all be taking place next 80 to 12 hours, 24 or 48 hours really until Monday. It's going to be an absolutely extraordinary weekend of horse trading in Westminster. Alex, I don't know whether we're extrapolating too much or whether the markets are just too optimistic, but the markets for the moment seem pretty encouraged by the process. Now the process also seems to be putting the Conservative Party as pragmatists, right? We could have a Prime Minister as soon as Monday. What does this tell us about whether this Chancellor could also stay in place to make sure they deliver this autumn budget on October 31st? I think you're right for markets that is absolutely the key question. Is there going to be enough stability that allows Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor's fiscal statement to take place on October 31st as planned? It depends who becomes Prime Minister, so there is a degree of uncertainty there. If perhaps Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister, it would probably be likely that he would reappoint Jeremy Hunt as Chancellor. There would be, the decisions essentially would already be made about what to do on October 31st or close to being made. There wouldn't be a need to postpone that date and the budget could go ahead as planned on October 31st.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5207,2022-10-21 08:06:11
16802," We made about what to do on October 31st or close to being made. There wouldn't need to be a need to postpone that date. And the budget could go ahead as planned on October 31st. If a different candidate, perhaps a candidate from the right wing of the party, potentially Boris Johnson or somebody else, became Prime Minister, it is not a hundred percent certain that Jeremy Hunt would remain as Chancellor. If there a new Chancellor was appointed by the Prime Minister next week, it would be tough to see a turn around in time for October 31st. They would want to look at the books, they would want to look at the options, and we may see a delay then at that point over a few days to the October 31st statement. And Alex, I know everything is to play at this point, but if you look at what the bookmakers see as the two front runners, so plenty more done, and where she's sooner. Could you describe them as potentially technocrats, that nothing much will change in terms of growth patterns and keeping the markets on side? I think any Prime Minister who takes over has to recognise the situation with the markets under Liz Trust. Nobody is going to take over, go back to Liz Trust day one, and attempt some sort of radical, rightly illibitorial approach to the economy that tanks the markets again. That is clearly not at anybody's interest to do that. So whoever takes over, I think the policies that they come up with, and the statement that they make towards the end of October, beginning of November, whenever it is, should be along the same lines as what Jeremy Hunt was planning to announce. Certainly, if it's Hunt or Mordant, that there would be a large degree of stability there, and it would be a continuity of the Jeremy Hunt's administration that we've seen in the dying days of Liz Trust. There is just that question mark of what happens if a right wing candidate takes over. Does it do a few of those Hunt ideas get unpicked? However, it should broadly be towards the same direction of what Hunt was doing, because the reality is anything deviates too much from that, will spook the markets, and that's not in the interest of whoever takes over as Prime Minister. Alex, thank you so much. As always, for all of your insight to Alex Wickham there, and of course Alex has a great read out every Friday that goes over the weekend, so we'll push it out on social media, and I urge everyone to read that. Let's get straight to your Bloomberg business flash, here's the end here, it's highly end. Hi, Francine. The US has said to be discussing whether it should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures, including his Twitter takeover to national security reviews. This comes as officials have grown uncomfortable over what they see, as a billionaire's increasingly Russia-friendly stance. Separately, the Washington Post reports Musk is planning to slash Twitter's workforce by 75% in the coming months. Now, Adidas has issued a fresh profit warning as unsolved goods piled up, and consumer demand weakens across China and Western markets. The German sportswear maker says it now expects an operating margin, or 4% this year, down from a prior forecast of 7% CEO Casper Rostead has already announced he's stepping down next year. And Kering has posted slower sales growth in luxury rivals Alviam H and her mayors during the third quarter. The Gucci brand, which accounts for more than half of Kering's revenue, was held back by China's continuing COVID restrictions. Ad CFO told analysts the Italian brands revenue from the mainland declined during the quarter, and the situation there is still not back to normal, and that's your Bloomberg Business Flash, Branthi. Lian, thanks so much. Later in the program, we'll look at the runners and riders and the race to follow List Trust as UK Prime Minister and Weather Boris Johnson could really make a comeback.

When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird. A real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. Let's move to some more. finance politics. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition of From Seen Life Right Here in Westminster in London. It's all about political turmoil investors focused on the UK where the conservative party is desperate to draw a line under Liz Cross's disastrous primership. Now we're joined by Christina Kino Bloomberg's markets editor we're also joined by Bailey Wakefield, multi-assiport folio manager at Aviva Investor. So thank you both for being with us today. Christine, when you look at the markets they're they're pretty cool headed about this election and we should or could have a prime minister, a new prime minister by Monday. What's being priced in? Are they assuming that the current chancellor stays in his place? I think that is the working assumption for investors at this moment Francine and thus why there is a sense of relative common markets despite the political turmoil that we've seen in the UK and this is the norm usually right? Markets tend to not really care so much about politics one because they're not very good at pricing political risk but also to it's not for some time until any sort of political upheaval will have real consequences for for instance the public or the country's state of finances or what it means for the central bank which is really the two things that investors really care about and so you know I think while we're kind of in this process I would expect markets to kind of be in this sort of holding pattern probably something that changes with regard to what happens at the treasury or if anything the bank of England then that would be when markets were really start to pay attention and kind of reprise any new catalyst from here. Bailey if you were in charge of finances if you were a chancellor what would you do to to push this country back on the growth path what are markets expecting and hoping for? Sure I think the main factor for the UK at the moment is that we're quite short on certainty the only certainty that we have at the moment is that Liz Trust won't continue to be for our minister the key question for markets is whether that normal policy making can resume breakdowns of what we would consider to be the normal policy making Kelo is 1985 degrees so this mean",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5209,2022-10-21 08:15:03
16804," question for markets is whether that normal policy making can resume. Breakdowns of what we would consider to be the normal policy making approach has led to that increased market volatility and whatever would bring us back to that more conventional approach is something that markets would take up for in. Bailey, what comes for £5 next? If you look at the 31st item statement, are we actually going to get it if we don't get a prime minister by Monday evening? Sure, so for us, we currently prefer the US dollar to Sterling. While in the near term, Sterling might be supportive, as supported as some of the trust government risk premium is priced out, there are longer term structural challenges that remain in place. Sterling is currently being held up by a policy tightening and there's around 175 bits of tightening penciled in for the rest of this year, which we could well see, but then another 100 bits in Q1 might be a step too far if the economy is suffering. We know that there are a number of challenges for the UK economy, like rising foreign costs and consumer confidence being near historic lows, whereas we know that the dollar is a safe haven currency that's being supported by a hawkish fed rhetoric. So again, it's going back to that stability argument and making sure that investors have confidence. Christine, we heard from the former Chancellor of the Extractor Philo-Pam, and he does not see how the Bank of England can continue with the timeline on QT because of proximity, of course, to the Bank of England decision, but because we are basically in leading or finding a new conservative leader, do you think they'll push that back and how will markets interpret push back of QT? Yeah, I think at this stage, it will be very difficult for the Bank of England to deliver an informed policy decision, just considering the timeline that we're looking at. It is very, very tight for the Bank to consider everything that has changed over the last couple of weeks here in the UK government. And so, yeah, I think the base expectation is starting to become that they may be, there may be a delay in this process, both in terms of potential policy decision on the November 3rd original date and also what they're going to be doing with that QT program. I think that is, to some extent, what has void bond markets over the past few weeks? And I think it will have to be a continued conversation and communication challenge for the Bank to indicate to markets what their plan is going to be for this program. But I think at this point in time, investors are very much kind of pricing in a little bit of a delay here, which is why we're seeing quite the rally in UK bond markets, particularly in the long end. All right, thank you, guys, for joining us, Bailey Wakefield, there, Multia support, Folio Manager at Aviva Investors and our very own Christina Kino, Bloomberg's markets editor joining us. And I will have plenty more, of course, throughout the day, right here at Westminster, coming up one report suggests that Elon Musk plans to slash 75% Twitter's workforce as part of this takeover.

And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hater and Love is good. Now I would have a much more experience about those who say that love you and tend to stray you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean?

Brexit has not gone away. Make up call here for the conservative party for continuing coverage. Keep attuned to Bloomberg Television and Radio. Economics, finance, politics. This is Bloomberg's available early edition on Fronting Black White here in Westminster, in London. Now, the Washington Post is reporting Elon Musk plans to cut nearly 75 percent of Twitter's workforce as part of his takeover. As talks progress advisors are working to get the $44 billion deal closed by the end of the month. Shares. The social media app have taken a beating in pre-market trading this morning, so let's get a conversation going. Elon Musk joining us now is Bloomberg's quick take. Alex Webb. Alex, great to speak to you just now. So take us to his latest 75 percent layoffs as a huge number. Yes. The head count is about 7,500, so the expectation is this would take it down to about 2000. This is obviously being reported by the Washington Post citing some documents that they've seen. It is a big number. There are concerns about what that might mean for content moderation, for the security of the platform when it comes to hacking and things like that. But weirdly in Silicon Valley, it isn't necessarily considered that shocking by a lot of people. It's a sort of all orthodoxy in parts of the Bay Area that Twitter has got too much head count, that it is not efficiently run as a company and 75 percent may be a lot more than people had expected, but there was the expectation they do come in and slash the lot of jobs. So Alex, will this be a first step to hiring free of new staff? I mean, in a sense, it is kind of similar to that private equity approach of coming slash and rebuild. And perhaps then rebuild in a way that is more efficient and more effective. But you kind of have to say it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5211,2022-10-21 08:23:31
16806," Private equity approach of coming, slash and rebuild. And perhaps then rebuild in a way that is more efficient and more effective. One thing you kind of have to say if you look at Tesla, which at times is quite lean, it isn't actually run terribly efficiently. If you look at Tesla and you look at average revenue per employee, it actually lags quite a lot of its rivals. And so you do wonder whether Elon is the person who's able to build a more efficient, effective model. But presumably he then comes in and reallocates resources in a way he considers more effective. So Alex, how's the acquisition process actually looking at the moment? Will it go through? I mean, the deadline's next week? So the bankers, which be, you know, our colleagues are reporting that bankers are accelerating this. They are confident they're going to get it closed by the end of the month. There is a bit of a fly anointment, namely regulators that some of Elon Musk tweets, which seem to not quite support Russia and the Ukraine, but propose Russia actually annexing parts of Ukraine. They have flagged the awareness of some US authorities and who are according to our colleagues reporting, looking at some of Elon Musk's ventures. And there's a deep irony in the middle of this that it looked at one stage, as though essentially the government, the courts at the very least, were going to force him to buy Twitter. There's a distinct possibility, albeit perhaps an outside one, that they might now say, actually, you can't buy Twitter for national security reasons. So that perhaps is the reason the stock is down quite a lot today. We just have to see how realistic a prospect that is. Okay, Alex, thanks so much. As always, Alex Web there from Bloomberg Quicktake. Now we'll have plenty more, of course, on Musk and Twitter throughout the day. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg first-word news, here's the end here. It's highly end. Hi, Francine. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the blocs' energy crisis. That's after Germany yielded pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. European Council President Shulzmouschal says it sends a clear signal to the market that the bloc is ready to act together. Now, the White House has accused Iran of sending technicians to Crimea to support Russian attacks on Ukraine with Iranian-made drones. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia must compensate his country for the destruction following Moscow's invasion. The St. Louis of Fed says it will think differently in future about its officials participating in private events. That's after criticism of its president, James Bullard, for speaking last week at a private event hosted by city group. Bullard's appearance could be seen as a violation of Fed rules that aim to avoid providing advantage to any market participants.

16807," music There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that's attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel, to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our special coverage on the UK race for a new UK Prime Minister. Well, I'm bouncing like what outside Westminster where history has been made and another battle is underway for the keys to number 10 Downing Street. Now, this trust says she was a fighter who wasn't going anywhere. But when the podium was rolled out in front of Downing Street on Thursday, it was all over. Given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. While joining us now is Conservative MP, Karamakartne, he's a member of the influential 1922 committee which oversees the election of new leaders in the party. He's also a supporter of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Thank you so much for joining us. First of all, given the rules that the committee laid out very clearly on the process of electing a new Conservative leader, is this pragmatism before ideology? Do you think Mr. McCartney will have a Prime Minister by Monday evening? That's a potential possibility. And first of all, thank you very much for having me on. But the 1922 committee changed the bar, if you like. They raised the bar. So obviously, the last leadership election, the nominations only need to be 20 for each candidate. This time, it's 100 nominations are going to be needed to be one of the candidates. And that means just on the fact that there's only 360 odd Conservative members' apartments, there can only be a maximum of three candidates come to a clock on Monday afternoon. And we need to ask strictly, the country needs that, we need some stability and we need to move forward.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5213,2022-10-21 08:32:09
16808," be a maximum of three candidates come to a clock on Monday afternoon. And we need to act strictly. The country needs that. We need some stability and we need to move forward. And obviously one of the reasons that I'm talking to you is because I'm also a backer of Boris Johnson because I think you'd be the best person to unite the party and move forward. He has a mandate, obviously, 2019, won a general election with a huge majority. And there's still two years to go of that five-year term. But Carl, so first of all, do you think he will definitely be one of those two people? Do you think Boris Johnson will be able to get those 100 votes, signatures from MPs? I do. And by last night, after nine hours, there was over 50 Conservative members' apartments who placed their support. And we're willing to be his nominees. But at this point in time, we don't even know if he's willing to stand. So he hasn't... Well, in fact, none of my colleagues have actually said that they're definitely going to be candidate. Obviously, because they're all busy taking soundings and finding out if they're going to be able to reach that 100 member threshold to make sure they get the nomination papers in well in time before two o'clock on Monday. Given how Boris Johnson's Premorship ended, why do you think this would bring stability? It was pretty chaotic. How is this an antidote to the chaos that we saw under List Trust? Well, for the country and the Conservative Party, actually, the Labour Party and some of the media did their utmost for what, six, seven, eight, nine months to castigate him to throw as much muck as they could in to try and make some stick. Because, ultimately, he's the best electoral asset the Conservative Party has. And for the past three, four months, all I've ever had from my constituents in my marginal seating Lincoln is that they want to see Boris back. And that's whether I'm business in businesses and speaking to business people, whether that's an constituency where I meet shopping in the various different supermarkets or even filling up my car. But not one person has come to me and said, we're really pleased that you got rid of Boris Johnson. So obviously, yes, Conservative voters in the main, I think, are one of the electorates. And obviously, when a general election comes along before December 24, I'd say that Boris Johnson being our Prime Minister, we've got the best chance of winning that general election. But actually, in the meantime, the parliamentary parties got to coalesce behind one person and be loyal to that Prime Minister as we move forward. We never expected to be in this place. But obviously, if there's a vote of the membership after Monday, then the Conservative Party members, I think, will back Boris should he make the final two to be the Prime Minister of our country? But Mr. McCartney, is this really putting party politics before everything? I mean, it's pretty clear that the markets may have questions about the new transfer, if it's Boris Johnson. So he may give you a bit more power to win the next election. But what kind of markets, what kind of an economy will we be left with? It's not the stable one you were talking about two minutes ago. Well, it is the stable one, actually. So, you know, Boris Johnson has been in the position before and should he decide to be nominated and to be a candidate? And, you know, should he, as I would know, win that and become the Prime Minister? And the markets know what he and others around him would be like. And I'm sure, you know, he doesn't want to make any of those mistakes that were attributed to him or the party might have, you know, taken missteps in the past. And we're ensure that, you know, we need to ensure that very swiftly we have a Prime Minister in place who, yes, has the backing of the Parliamentary Party. And that's imperative, as we've seen. This is one of the reasons why what happened yesterday wasn't expected, you know, three months ago or even 45, 46 days ago. And so, you know, I'm sorry that there's trust in those around during our family, et cetera, was a very difficult decision for her. But we need to move forward, yes, on behalf of the country and our party. And certainly, to ensure that the government continues with this small bump in the road, navigated and we move on swiftly on. And, you know, steady the bumps is a good phrase to say. And I think that the markets, and when we certainly look at those financially, both in the UK and around the world, are well aware of Boris Johnson's time previously as the Prime Minister. And obviously, you know, that's something that he was elected, as I say, back in 2019. There's another two years of this parliamentary period, and I'm a five year period to take into account. Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5214,2022-10-21 08:36:34
16809," In 2019, there's another two years of this parliamentary period, of a five-year period to take into account. Yes? Do you think, I mean, given the timeline, which is we're expecting an autumn statement on 31st of October to have more ideas, physically, of what this country will become. Then we have, of course, on 3rd November, the Bank of England, and the first starts as QT. If Boris Johnson is elected, the next leader of the Conservative Party, should he keep this current chancellor? Well, it's up to a prime minister. At this point in time, as I've said, Boris Johnson hasn't confirmed the least standing. In fact, no deal. Why is it going to keep the current chancellor? You can't tie the hands of any new prime minister. So whoever the new leader of our party is, who will de facto become the prime minister, that's up to them to decide whether they want to keep the current chancellor and their team that they're going to have round them, they're going to want to obviously make some changes, I would imagine, from the team that was around the previous prime minister, or she's still in post-Elizabeth Trust. But that's the way the politics works in our country. The prime minister gets to choose their team. And so, I'm not going to tie the hands of whoever is going to win out next week. But whoever the prime minister is, the Conservative Party needs to pledge their loyalty. The parliamentary party certainly need to remember that, you know, and divided we for, but united we stand. Thank you so much, Karmacart, neither. The UK Conservative MP for Lincoln. Now, let's continue our coverage. Thank you. Special coverage here from Westminster. We're also joined by Servin's cable, the former leader of the Liberal Democrat Party and former Secretary of State for Business. Thank you, Servin's, for joining us. What would be your path forward for the UK on growth in the next 12 months? Well, there isn't a great deal. The government can do it to sort of trigger growth. I mean, that was the problem with the trust, many budget that somehow whether you can conjure growth out of thin air, you can't. The key requirement is going to be to maintain basic stability, political and economic stability. And I really worry about the next week or so, because, you know, if Boris Johnson is a viable candidate, and he looks at the years, he will seriously challenge Sunaka as the front runner. And I think there are two consequences of that. One is that the Boris Johnson philosophy of cakeism, you know, is you can always have your cake and eat it, not avoid difficult choices is going to be back on the menu. And we're faced with the oncoming new budget announcement, which either will face a new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who doesn't believe in it, or whose supporters will cause a great deal of difficulty for Sunaka, who is the most plausible candidate, should he win? So we're in for, you know, quite a difficult period of economic turbulence. If the tourism system remaining in power and not going to the country, so we can have a stable government after an election. But, Sylvain, I mean, we've seen, you know, pretty chaotic markets. We've seen an economy, frankly, that was whipsod in the last three months. We've seen, you know, all the question marks regarding UK PLC in the last 12 months. If Boris Johnson were to become Prime Minister again, would he not have learned from any of that? Well, I would worry about the consequences. So for several reasons, I mean, he's very divisive figure in the country. And I would imagine within the Tory party, although I know that conservative myself, I think we need to remember that only a few months ago, a majority of his parliamentary colleagues threw him out as unsuited to lead the country. My party had just won by elections in wildly improbable places. I mean, Mr Johnson has his qualities, he's a skilled politician, but a very divisive figure. I suspect he still faces con misconduct allegations as well, you know, empowerment and possibly elsewhere. So that isn't going to solve our problems. Mr Sunak is a better bet to impose he has a better positive trust that helps him by than never.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5215,2022-10-21 08:40:58

16811," shapes us. This is Emma Barnett meets on Bloomberg Quickshade. We've seen the power of the markets over the last few weeks. I think Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was getting on top of that, putting together a package that would have been reassuring to the markets on 31st of October. Clearly what we mustn't do now is anything which signals to the markets more chaos, instability and uncertainty. Former UK Chancellor, the extracurricular, Philip Hammond, speaking to us a little bit earlier this morning here at Westminster. Now the race, of course, for new UK Prime Minister, is on. I'm Francy Lacko with special coverage outside Westminster here in London. Now let's speak to our editor-in-chief, John McElthweight, who understands UK politics and of course knows a lot of the players also that could run. John, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, what I'm hearing today, which was largely discounted yesterday, was that Boris Johnson really has a chance. Could he be the next Prime Minister? The answer is he could. I think when you complimented me by saying I understand British politics, I don't think anybody understands British politics at the moment. I think everyone has been thrown completely by the events of the past few, the past the past the past months and so, and the level of credibility that has led away, but there is no doubt that Boris, if you can get over those 100 MPs, does stand a chance. And certainly if he gets anywhere close to the members, I think you see quite a lot of support for him still there. Among the MPs, it was quite interesting to hear, I think, Philip Hammond just talking about the need for stability, you know, sensableness. Those are not. Stability has never been Boris Johnson's middle name. He has always been something of an anarchist, something of a provocateur. He's good at forming coalitions of people to get individual things done. If he was somehow sort of locked into something, then maybe it would be different. But I think at the moment most Tory MPs, those investments to the other night, they are skeptical about that. Yeah, but John, so it was my understanding through the rules that the 1922 committee laid out yesterday, but actually the Tories just wanted to be pragmatic, wanted some kind of stability and maybe signal to the markets that really they need business to, you know, draw a line under the sound of the last 44 days. If there is a chance that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, is then the calculation that they just want to have a shot at the next election. Yes. I mean, the argument for Boris, he has one quite good argument, is that the moment the Labour Party is jumping up and down and saying, look, we need another election, nobody has given anybody a mandate. Well, the truth is that Boris, whatever his pluses or minuses, did win a massive election victory just a couple of years ago. So he does have a clearer mandate in that way than anybody else. The problem is all the words you've used, you mentioned pragmatism, stability. You know, these are not things that want to immediately associate to the Boris Johnson, and if you take on top of it, the problems he has with the privileges committee that he could quite likely possibly be actually expelled, not quite likely, there's a possibility that he could be expelled, lose his afterfighter by election because of breaking the rules about not telling the truth to Parliament. So he does come with a lot of baggage. On the whole, my guess is that the Tories will try and fix it. If they show, if they've got any ounce of their several centuries worth of cunning left, they will try and fix it so that there is somebody who emerges probably over Suneck or Mortant in a way that they can all unite around them. There is talk this morning of a Suneck Johnson's talks going on quite a little background. So, John, if you're a market participant right now, you probably want three questions answered, which is, do we go ahead with those fiscal plans on the 31st of October? Does the Bank of England continue with its plans for QT on November 1st and then what happens with interest rates on November 3rd? If we have a penny more done or a Rishi Suneck as Prime Minister, do you assume that those will be easier questions to answer because they'll be more...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5217,2022-10-21 08:49:52
16812," If we have a penny more downed or a Rishi Sunak as Prime Minister, do you assume that those will be easier questions to answer because they'll be more of a technocratic kind of government? I think you could probably do that. The only thing which is another very, very small argument of favour of Boris is if ever there was a time when he would be caged by economics, this is it. And so that could be the least a little bit of what's going on in the background with Sunak and Boris. The interesting thing about the UK at the moment, it doesn't really matter. You just had Vince Cable on from the Liberals. You could have Keir Starmer on from Labour. You could have Jeremy Hunt. At the moment there is very little room for maneuver. There's like a narrow tram line and whichever party is in government is going to have to go down that one because so much credibility has been lost. So on the whole, if you're on the left, you might try and spend slightly more money to do more for social equality. If you're on the right, you might try and cut a few taxes here or there, but there is not a lot of room and in a strange way, it's much more similar to those kind of elections at the economic country you and I occasionally talk about. Italy or southern Europe during the Euro crisis where there really wasn't very much room for maneuver. Britain has lost so much credibility so quickly that even the kind of tax cut or even the giveaways that trust did to begin with or that were promised before that didn't entirely spook the market and now seen as unacceptable. So there is a very, very narrow room for maneuver at the moment. So to that extent, yes Boris, but probably more more than to or Sunak would have to stick very solidly to that technocratic idea. So John, the way elections work in the UK, it's of course a Tory party that has to call for them because otherwise they stay in power for the next two years. Philip Hammond rightly reminded me that turkeys don't usually vote for Christmas, but what's the path to possible general elections earlier than in two years? The answer is turkeys don't normally vote for Christmas and say that the odds are very heavily on the Tories not doing that. You know, the vast again, Gengran Westminster, most of them are in a state of shock that people with very safe seats are now in danger of losing it. If you have a 30% change, so from their point of view merely if the Tories got back to losing by five points or ten points, you ended up with a Stama government. Most Tory MPs currently there would still keep their seats, others would not. The problem in this particular thing, and this is where the ancestral problem of Brexit comes on, is that you have got some fairly, I can put it so, a deranged turkeys wandering around the farm yard, and they are sufficiently kind of stoked up mainly on the kind of Brexit that's a hard line Brexit side. A few on the others, you can already see people saying they won't support Johnson. There might just be enough of those, depending on who wins, to join Labour in a vote of no confidence. Because to be fair to the way the British Constitution works, and it's probably at this time worth, ironically reminding ourselves that people used to come to this country to examine the Constitution and learn from it. This isn't really a kind of constitutional problem what's going on at the moment. It's a massive political problem inside one party to do with confidence and so on and so on. But at this precise moment, that's a very simple thing. The MPs elect the Prime Minister if those MPs don't want that particular government, and enough of them move on the Conservative side to say that whoever's been chosen is unacceptable. And they join Labour in a vote of no confidence than that person is out. But that is the, yes, Philip Hamers, absolutely right. Turkeys don't normally vote for Christmas. In this case, I think we've seen enough evidence that the turkeys are not entirely thinking about their well-being. John, thank you so much. Blumbering editor-in-chief, John McEltsweights. Now, let's get straight to a pollster. They are very good, especially in times of crises like these, we don't exactly know what's going on. So let's discuss the polling figures with Gideon Skinner. He's head of political research at Ipsos. Gideon, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, I mean, what are the polls right now? Does Boris Johnson really have a shot? So if we look at the data, Boris Johnson's ratings are...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5218,2022-10-21 08:53:55
16813," First of all, what are the polls right now? Does Paris Johnson really have a shot? So if we look at the data, Boris Johnson's ratings are amongst the general public as a whole. They're behind where Rishi Sunak is. He's more popular amongst the Conservatives' own base, so they're 2019 voters. But frankly, as I was just being talking about, neither of the contenders at the moment really look like they're a magic wand for the Conservatives, given the underlying troubles that they're facing. This may be a stupid question, because I know the bookmakers actually have bets on how ampeasable though. You don't have any, you don't have any surveys on that, do you? We wait for them to declare. Who do you think, I mean the calculation, right? Is that Boris Johnson could win something for the Tories in the next two years? But what happens in the next 24 hours? Well, I think what's going to be happening is clearly all the candidates and the MPs are going to be trying to garner support. They're going to be trying to lay out their case. If you look at what the polls are saying, as I said, Rishi Sunak gets better scores generally amongst the public as a whole. Boris Johnson will be pointing to his better scores amongst the base, but you have to remember when Boris Johnson left office over the summer. His own personal ratings weren't particularly good either. They'd been falling. So we were seeing seven in ten. We're pessimistic about the economy. We saw Keir Starmer had taken the lead as most capable prime minister, which is the first time a Labour leader had done that for a long time. So there were still lots of criticisms of Boris Johnson, and he gets higher negative ratings as well as his positive ratings. It's quite amazing, actually, that we've just gone back to speak about Boris Johnson, like non-stop since 6am this morning. He didn't talk to me a little bit about if there's a general election tomorrow, is Labour still 36 points ahead? Well, in our most recent poll, we had the 21 points ahead, but that was still the biggest lead that we'd seen for 20 years. So you're getting a range of leads in the polls, but really the underlying point is that Labour have got a very clear lead, which at the moment would suggest they would get an easy majority. But of course, we're not in an election period right now. And then who knows what we'll see over the winter months because of the energy crisis, because of the cost of the living crisis. So are you expecting polls to change quite dramatically, depending on who the next prime minister is and how they handled only the economy? So politics has been very volatile over the last years, months. So it wouldn't be surprising to see more changes. But I mean, yes, still the fundamental issues facing the Conservative Party in particular, are the biggest issues for the public, are the cost of living and the economy. You know, this is a level of concern we haven't seen about inflation for 40 years in its policies polling. So it's a big new concern for the public. And people are doubting the Conservatives long-term economic plans, they're losing confidence in it, and Labour have got the first lead on it for 15 years. So that's where the Conservatives need to regret and be gaining their credibility. Thank you so much, Gignan Skinner there, had a political research at Ipsos joining us about well the popularity and probability of who the next prime minister is.

16814," onion onion These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. Nade on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a titanic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there will be a multiplier effect. How to Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters. Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. It's a good partner on Russia and Ukraine. And the British are going to solve the problem. And the British is a good partner. We fix high thresholds, but a threshold should be achievable by any serious candidates who has a realistic prospect to go through. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early addition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lymes. It is 5 a.m. in New York, 10 a.m. in London and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, our top stories. Today, political chaos continues. The UK could have a new prime minister as soon as Monday after Liz Truss' resignation gave her the shortest premiership in British history. Unity on energy Germany agrees to join other EU countries and exploring a gas price as the continent leaders tackle the looming crisis in Brussels. And stocks retreat amid high bond yields. In fact, the highest since 2007, the 10 year treasury yield holds at its highest level since the financial crisis. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance. Early addition on Matt Miller with Kayleigh Lymes here in New York. Anna Edwards is with us at West Minster right now. Anna, and you are following the increasingly interesting race to become the next prime minister.

16815," And you definitely saw that in Asia as well. The MSCI Asia Pacific index down about 1.2% overnight. Part of that has to do with West Capitite broadly, but there is also concern around COVID-0 policy with lockdowns in part of Shion in China. Plus, you have news overnight reports from Bloomberg that the U.S. is looking to expand new curves on Chinese access to equipment, including computing technology. So even broadening those out. That weighed on ship stocks in particular. One of them, Piotek, which was down about 4.5% in the Asian session. Now, as you talked about, Matt, Treasury yields moving higher. That was definitely evident with yields moving higher in the Asia Pacific as well. A 14 basis points on the Australian tenure to just shy of 4.2%. So we're back up near the highest levels since 2014. But we are at the weakest levels since the summer of 1990 on the Japanese yen. And it is still weakening. Right now, $1.50, 94. We are looking home at a CUSB of a 151 handle in that means we are on intervention watch again today. Absolutely. So that's the FX story dominating through the Asia session. The FX story here in Europe very focused on the pounds and potential weakness in the pounds. Some of that coming through already. This is the picture we have for European equity markets that under some pressure. It is a bit of nervousness around UK politics, but really it's also the global dynamic around rising treasury yields around rising yields broadly and how that weighs on risk appetite. Profitability also being challenged in a number of areas will come to some consumer goods companies with that focus a little bit later on in this conversation. Let's get to some other UK assets or broader European assets. Here's the UK for you. 1140 on the pound. We've got the euro also gaining against the pounds. So yes, there's dollar strengths, but there really is pound weakness coming through today. And we've got some movement on guilt yields, of course. The nervousness really here is around the 31st of October. That fiscal statement was when UK financial markets thought they'd get some clarity on fiscal plans. And if we don't know who the prime minister is and then by definition, we're not entirely sure if we'll see a change of chancellor again, that throws big questions around that. And so leads to some uncertainty around around UK assets. Perhaps we've also got in here the European natural gas price, the benchmark there down by 6.7%. Germany stepping back from its previous prior opposition to a gas price cap that weighing on the price of gas today. And it seems as if they're trying to rework that benchmark anyway. So perhaps some good news as we look into the winter. If those gas prices do continue to fall. So here in Westminster, the UK has been plunged into a fresh political crisis following the resignation of its shortest serving prime minister. Liz Truss is chaotic 40 day, 40 day tenure, saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Here's what happened after the lectern was placed outside number 10. I recognize though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty, the King, to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. So after 44 days, she resigns. Joe Mays, our colleague, our UK government reporter, joins me now here in Westminster to take us through some of the latest and some of the analysis. Joe, give us the latest then, where we've got to on who's likely to be on the list of contenders. So we're looking at three big names, former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordent, and also former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's got momentum this morning as more and more of his backers want him to come back, but the key number is 100. Can you get 100 nominations from MPs to get onto that ballot and then it would go to Monday, where we have these votes of MPs, there'll be two votes we expect. And that's second vote when there's just two candidates left who've been indicative votes. And the hope in the party is that, whoever, if they're runner up in that vote will step down, so we get the new Prime Minister on Monday. So the hope is that we don't have to get this out. Don't have to push this out to the party membership like last time that this can be decided by members of Parliament, Kaley. Well, depending on who it ultimately is, Joe, do we have a sense of what their priorities will be or what they can possibly accomplish given the difficulty that Liz Truss had with setting her agenda? Well, the big focus is on what economic approach they would take. And I think the expectation is that whoever becomes Prime Minister, whether that's where she's doing that, Penny Borden, or in deep or stonston, they would likely keep Jeremy Hunt in place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5221,2022-10-21 09:09:03
16816," Well the big focus is on what economic approach they would take. I think the expectation is that whoever becomes Prime Minister, whether that's where she's seen out, Penny Modern, or in D Boris Johnson, they would likely keep Jeremy Hunt in place as a chance that at least until October 31st, when we expect that fiscal statement, but as Adam's just saying, there is some doubt around that date now because the new Prime Minister might want to change things up, might want to change their priorities. But the UK has been through such a trauma with financial markets recently. I don't think they'd want to tip the cart over again and do something that would destabilise things. So I think Hunt stays at least in the short term, but then in terms of, yeah, it's all about stabilisation. It's all about trying to get those yields down again, improve the position of the pounds. And that's why I think we'll see a cautious approach from whoever becomes Prime Minister in the next few days. All right, Joe, thanks very much, Bloomberg's Joe Mays, covering the political story for us from Westminster. Let's turn now back to the continent. Of course, the UK has left the European Union, but the intense levels of political uncertainty in Great Britain are also impacting the EU and regional stability there. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to our European correspondent, Maria, today, yesterday. France, as a nation and friend of the British people, above all, wants stability, especially in the current context. In a context of war, of energy crisis, it is important that the United Kingdom regains political stability very quickly. Maria joins us now from Brussels. So Maria, how do European leaders view this turmoil in the UK? Well, Matt, I have to be honest, and this morning, very little reaction. European leaders are 100% focused today on the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine and the difficult winter they have ahead. And in fact, that reminds me of a conversation I had yesterday with a European diplomat who told me, essentially, this lost in translation between the UK and the EU comes down to that. In the United Kingdom, this is still a Brexit-dominated single-story political system when you look at the European Union. The priority is to have shifted, but I did have to do my job after all. Well, I have to shout questions to our politicians. And then I asked that question to the French President, are you sad? Will you miss her? What's your reaction? Will you plate it in that clip? We want to see stability in the UK. This is a challenging context for Europe in general with the war in Ukraine. He also told me, quote, I'm sad the way I would be sad with any other colleague that leaves. Not a lot of emotion, but the reality is Matt, how could he? He saw her once in person, a lot of European leaders got no face-time weather, and she did not even make her big Brussels debut. So can you really be sad when you don't know a person? I mean, that's a question I put to you. Right. OK, again, 44 days, a limited number of people you can meet, I suppose. More importantly, where you are, Maria, there has been agreements on energy, on capping gas prices, including crucially, from Germany. Yes, and Anna, let's break it down here, because this meeting yesterday was important. And Faggot was a deal accomplished at 2.45 AM in the morning. Now, the question I get from a lot of traders, by the way, reaching out on our systems is suggestive. But what is it that's new? What was agreed yesterday? I don't get it. The thing to clarify is that yesterday was not a technical meeting on a specific level of price cap on a percentage. This was a political discussion, whether or not the EU27 could even agree to the word cap. Remember, the Germans were adamant they did not want to see it, but could potentially scare of supply. Now there is a deal on the language. They agreed that their proposals put forward by the commission, including that dynamic price cap, including the joint purchases, including joint storage, should go ahead and now give themselves two to three weeks to work out the legal and the pending details around this package. All right. Bloomberg's Maria today, doing her job, shouting questions and reporting for us from Brussels. Thank you so much. Let's turn out of the market impact after a month of economic chaos under List Trust's tenure. It will be up to the next Prime Minister to restore calm and make policy decisions that bring back stability to the markets. Bloomberg's Danny Burger joins us now with a closer look at the recent action, and you're definitely not seeing stability today. Guilt yields are up, and I would note it's not just the UK, the German tenure, Bund yield just passed two and a half percent for the first time since 2011. Yeah, and BTPs are selling off.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5222,2022-10-21 09:13:16
16817," Gilt yields are up and I would know it's not just the UK, the German tenure, Boond yield just passed 2.5% for the first time since 2011. Yeah, and BTPs are selling off this morning and treasuries in the US are selling off. So yes, it is an ugly day for bonds in general and it has been remarkable to see the impact the bond vigil Anties have had now to be fair. The selloff is pretty steep in the current. The current bond is not just bonds, we're also seeing currencies sell off, specifically sterling. That's done 7.1% versus the dollar. And it's not dollar strength. It's also selling off versus the euro as well. Now we did see yesterday when Lys trust announcer resignation assets did move higher. So this isn't necessarily a story of negativity surrounding Lys trust first fiscal agenda that those into question what happens with the BOE. Obviously problematic for markets and not stability. I thought that soft gen frames this very well. They wrote in a note yesterday the recent U-turn on the mini budget and resignation of Lys trust should help the UK dodge a downgrade by S&P or Moody. So that's the positive. But the negative they write is that it's unlikely to mean an upgrade. But the negative they say that the value of the government and stability have been weakened since the recent turmoil. And we see that continue to show up in the data. The most recent borrowing figures we got from the UK yet again show that the UK had to borrow more than expected, which for those who are watching us on TV. I have that chart in front of me. But managers goes to show that regardless of who's PM, we have higher rates. We have more rates. We have more than expected. And of course, we have more than expected. So in this case, the UK has a lot of good results no matter who comes into the office. Danny, thanks very much Bloomberg, Danny burger giving us the market. Look at what's going on in the UK. Let's turn now back to markets in terms of equities, I should say, Twitter is falling as much as 13% in pre-market trading as the Biden administration and officials are looking to get the company. So, a lot going on. They also reportedly, well, Elon, I should say, looking to completely gut the company. Whether you have a report in the Washington Post that they could cut as much as 75% of head count given this about seven and a half thousand employees that would take it down to two thousand concerns that would particularly affect things like content moderation and some of the content that they could cut. You know, that's one piece which, frankly, isn't necessarily current share holders concerned, unless they have, of course, concerns as society, the impact on society. The thing that is a greater concern for investors is the report from our colleagues that the Biden administration is looking at some of Elon Musk assets that seems to be prompted by some of his tweets that didn't quite express support for Russia, but mooted perhaps the idea that Russia would have been able to bring a new record of the new trend in order to bring an end to the war, as well as his comments about not being able to continue to provide starlink, his satellite communications service to Ukrainians free of charge. So that called to our reporting has prompted some considerations from the administration. Always drama with this one. Bloomberg's Alex Web. Thank you so much. Now let's continue the conversation on social media and take a look at some of the other things that we've been seeing today. The news is that the new trend that we've seen today was not very pretty. They reported their slowest revenue growth on record, blaming a continued slow down in advertising spending as we see a softening in the economic environment. As a result, snapshares are down 26% and they're taking other advertising reliant companies down with them. Pinterest down 7.3% meta, which of course is the parent of Facebook down nearly 4% in the alphabet, the number of the market cap of these companies today. Matt. All right, let's take a look also at some of the movers that we have here in Europe. Adidas has a number of unsolved sneakers and it's cutting its forecast for the full year that stock as a result is down 9% instead be the only one that you would inhale faire more politique as you're wishing to purchase the legalДаpa fund that we hope that be the one that is in the Of New Japan Ukraine, which is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5223,2022-10-21 09:18:07
16818," In Europe, Adidas has a number of unsolved sneakers and it's cutting its forecast for the full year. The stock as a result is down 9%. This is, I think, one or the first red flag I saw this morning in terms of the consumer because, remember, we had Hermes doing so well, LVMH also has been doing so well. Carrying, on the other hand, is not doing so well. And the problem with caring isn't one that's new. This quarter, it's a problem with Gucci. That's been an issue now for three reporting periods in a row. They just can't keep up with their rivals in the luxury sector. So, carrying down as well, 4.2%. And then reports that Deutsche Bank reports on the Bloomberg that Deutsche Bank is going to have to cut staff in the investment bank to get ready for the downturn. As a result, the German stock is down 1.8%. Anna? Coming up on the program, then, Matt, we will think about where the early story has got to. You set out some of the concerns around it. Maria Vajnajna joins the States Street Senior Multi-Assets Strategies. We'll also ask about UK Assets as we continue to track UK politics. And on that front, we'll talk to Margaret Beckett, veteran Labour MP and former UK Foreign Secretary will get her perspective on what's happening in UK politics right now and where it twists and turns to you next. Plus, we'll talk to Isabelle Schemama, who is CEO of ACSA-IM-Alternatives. Real estate could be part of that conversation. Go Zara! I'm going to be a man who I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be, until actually curious, you've got to be, you've got to show up and you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. You just, yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over the place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. Welcome back to Bloomberg Surveillance. Early edition I'm Matt Miller with Kaley Lines here in New York. And I'm going to head with us out of London on Abbey, New Green this morning of course. Let's get to Maria Feitmanna our next guest and I want to bring her in with some points that were made in terms of what the problems are facing equities right now. Maria comes to us from State Street and Maria Goldman Sachs, graded as Kristen Mueller, Glysmann said there are three major risks heading into this earning season.

16819," As Christa Mueller glistman said, there are three major risks heading into this earnings season. Sales headwinds from a stronger dollar. We see real dollar strength today. The impact on margins of a weaker consumer concerns their caring and audidas highlight and of course input cost pressures from inflation. Plus taxes due to President Biden's inflation reduction acts. Are you as well concerned about these issues for earnings this season? For me, the key issue absolutely is margins impact. And what is interesting is maybe not that much current margin impact, but future margin impact. Because what we're seeing is that current earnings have actually been a lot better than lots of people feared. We still hear from companies about underlying strengths and consumers' spending. They're still subsaving. Labor market is still strong. So current earnings is a lot better than lots of people feared. The big, big concern is what happens next. We know what's happened next. On the mid going to slow and it would be so much more difficult to defend margins. So margins is number one priority for me. So you say, Maria, that things are basically going to sour going forward. And yet if you take a look at earnings expectations looking forward, we have started to see them come down. You can see that on the Bloomberg Terminal GTV Go as well. You'll find our whole chart library. But they have not rolled over to the extent we have seen equities rolling over. There is a very big mismatch between those two lines. When do you start seeing those material downgrades? And do they just catch up to the equity market or do equities further deteriorate along with those? I mean, for us, that big decline in margin in equities this year have been multiple compression. So as I said, underlined earnings have been okay. And even now, I mean, I think it's probably four earnings, earnings reporting season in the rows that analysts or market is really really surprised of kind of underlying earnings strength. So earning stories are still okay. I mean, not fantastic. Of course, we're seeing kind of slowdowns here and there. But okay, what we see in equities is multiple compression. And that's your macroeconomic headwinds. It sets your fed absolute focus on fighting inflation and doing whatever they need to slow aggregate demand. So that's what equities responded so far, but underlying earnings. I mean, they've been robust so far, but there is no question that monetary policy works with longer lags than before, but work still. So we will see earnings contraction. So that's all that's coming and that's all that makes me even more worried about equity outlook going forward. Okay, so that concerns you about equities into the future. Are you also thinking about the tax take that we're likely to see Western governments exert on their companies as a result of trying to fix fiscal black holes? Of course, this comes to mind because I'm here in the UK. And there's a lot of thoughts about whether energy companies will be more widely taxed or banks perhaps more widely taxed. But this could be something we see elsewhere as well. Oh, absolutely. And I mean, I think it's where unfortunately it's very often happens when they're kind of overall pie gets smaller, overall, overall economy is struggling. Governments do need to find ways of financing. And so they either increase taxes and that's bad for the kind of overall economy and corporate growth or they cut taxes, but then both Vingilantes come in and smack government. So it's very difficult balance for the governments to find. And I mean, you kind of have been rocking a hard place. However you do, there is no great outcome. So it is a very challenging environment. I would not be surprised that we'll see kind of attempts to increase taxes here and there. I mean, energy seems to be prime candidate. Marie, you're a senior. Multi-asset strategist at State Street looking across asset classes in this kind of everything slump. What's your favorite? I mean, do you like bonds here? Have we peaked in rates? Do you like private investments, private credit or private markets? Is there some place that investors can hide? Yeah, that's actually a very good question, Matt. I mean, we recently wrote our asset allocation kind of tactical asset allocation document. And it actually came, the model came out neutral, but not because we like anything. It was bad for stocks, bad for bonds, hiding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5225,2022-10-21 09:26:13
16820," allocation kind of tactical as a allocation document and it's actually came as a model came out neutral, but not because we like anything. It was bad for stocks, bad for bonds, hide and cash and hide and cash is very much a dollar trade. So we continue. I mean, dollar is obviously super strong, super crowded, super overwhelming, but it's a reserve currency. It's a safe currency and markets and investors are going there and that appreciating and we can we expect to continue dollar strengths. All right, Maria Vatmana of State Street. Thank you so much as always for joining us with your market insights. Now let's keep you up to date with other news from around the world with the first word. Sources say the US is looking into new export controls that would limit China's access to powerful emerging computing technologies where it told the potential plans focus on the still experimental field of quantum computing and artificial intelligence software. The White House has accused Iran of sending technicians to Crimea to support Russian attacks on Ukraine with Iranian made drones. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky says Russia must compensate his country for the destruction that has been brought by Moscow's invasion. And the St. Louis Fed says it will think differently in the future about its officials participating in private events. That's after criticism of its president, Jim Bullard, for speaking last week at a private event hosted by city group. Bullard's appearance could be seen as a violation of fed rules that aim to avoid providing advantage to any market participants. Coming up, we'll continue the conversation not just on the Fed, but monetary and fiscal policy broadly as there continues to be political upheaval in the UK. We'll have more from Westminster. And upwards, of course, is with Matt Miller and myself, Kayleigh Lines in New York. This is Bloomberg. — Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks App. In the News and Stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like Card dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a pie on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps will surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's pushing to ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

16821," I'm Mark Garment. experience. This is Bloomberg's surveillance edition. Here's what you need to know. Political chaos once again the UK could have a new Prime Minister as soon as Monday after Listera's resignation gave her the shortest premiership in the US to join other EU countries and exploring a gas price cap and the continent's leaders tackle the looming crisis in Brussels and stocks retreat amid a high bond yield the ten year Treasury yield holds at the highest level since the financial crisis. Welcome back to the programme. I'm Anna Edwards in Westminster covering the UK politics once again with Matt Millar and Kaley lines of course in the economic story very focused on, of course, rising yield environment. And that is to a large extent, a global narrative. We've seen that very much a preoccupation of markets overnight with what's been happening with US treasuries, but also with European expression around gilt samples. Yeah, we're definitely seeing yield rise around the globe. That's no good for stocks anywhere. And as a result, we see futures down here in the US. Right now down just about half a percent. And it would be the third negative day in a row. Nonetheless, it's been a pretty positive week so far. We are up 2.3% in terms of the cash trade because of the gains that we saw on Monday and Tuesday. We went all the way up to 37.20 right now. We're trading back down under 3700. And it looks like we could lose some more ground. The 10-year yield, you can see right now at 4.26.74. We've gone well over that above 4.28 today. And that is the highest we've seen on the 10-year treasury since 2007. So since the great financial crisis was really just kicking off, we also see an incredible strength in the dollar. Maria Feitmano was just commenting on this. But the all-time high on the Bloomberg dollar index is 13.53. That was at the end of September. Right now we're at 13.52 spot 1.8. So getting back to an all-time high. And that's a big headwind for equities for risk assets. A tailwind is a cheaper crude. Right now we are seeing 9x come down. But only about 2.3% of 1%. So WTI trading at $83.96 a barrel. Kaley, what are you seeing in terms of the pre-market movers? Well, there is a lot of action in the pre-market this morning. And a lot of it centers around social media companies. Some of it more idiosyncratic, which would be Twitter, because the saga continues. We had a couple reports out overnight. One from the Washington Post, that Elon Musk would plan to cut as much as 75% of Twitter's workforce if he does indeed succeed in taking over the company. And I say if, because there also is a Bloomberg report out overnight that the US and Biden administration officials are looking at whether or not they need to subject any of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews. So could that mean that he actually can't by Twitter at all? That may be one of the reasons why the stock is down about 9.3%. But there's other broader macro factors to consider in the social media an advertising reliant space. Evidence by Snap overnight, which reported, its slowest revenue growth on record, blaming an advertising slowdown and a softening macroeconomic environment. So as a result, Snap is down more than 25% before the bell. And it's taking peers like Pinterest and Meta Down with it. Pinterest down about 7.3% Meta Down, 3.8%. Tens of billions of dollars likely wiped off the market cap of these companies today, Anna. Yeah, really big moves there. Fascinating story around Twitter, around possible scrutiny, but also around the size of the business itself. Let's have a quick look at what's happening on European assets. Then the European equity story is negative. The stock 600 down by 1.6%. And we've got the pound 111.25 down by just shy of what.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5227,2022-10-21 09:35:13
16822," A quick look at what's happening on European assets then the European equity story is negative. The stock 600 down by 1.6%. We've got the pound 1125 down by just shy of 1% to focus on gilts as well but of course there is the global sell-off in bonds that we're seeing and a higher yield story across various geographies. But there is this UK angle to it of course around the tensions and the uncertainties in politics. We don't know who the Prime Minister will become Monday. We might have a Prime Minister though by Monday if not then Friday and then we don't know what happens with the 31st of October fiscal statement. That's going to be for the market. It's a key focus. Who is Chancellor? Who is at number 11 Downing Street? So that's the picture on the UK assets. We've also got the natural gas price in here just to once again reflect on how far we've fallen on natural gas prices. We were talking in the summer cale of 350 euros per megawatt hour. Now we're down at 114 and that is of course a long way from average prices before Russia's invasion of Ukraine but still much weaker today down by 9.8% as European leaders agree on some of the path ahead. Yeah so not quite good but definitely not as bad as it was. Things definitely are still not totally good in the UK political turmoil after as Lanna said, Liz trust quit as UK Prime Minister after a very brief and chaotic tenure that saw her announce a massive package of tax cuts before unwinding most of it in the face of a market route. Trust who is 47 said she was resigning after just 44 days in office and is said to become the shortest serving Prime Minister in British history. I have a bold plan to grow the economy through tax cuts and reform. It was becoming a distraction so that's why we immediately change that policy and that's the kind of government we are. We will keep an eye on grip on the nation's finances. Mr Speaker I think the last thing we need is a general election. We need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline. I have therefore decided to keep the increase in corporation tax that was planned by the previous government. I am a fighter and not a fighter. I recognise though given the situation I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the Conservative Party. I have therefore spoken to his majesty the King to notify him that I am resigning as leader of the Conservative Party. So the UK could have a new Prime Minister as soon as Monday after Trust's resignation. Rissu Stunach and Penny Mordant are among the front runners in the race and some MPs are calling for the return of Boris Johnson. Former UK Conservative Party leader Michael Howard spoke to us this morning and gave us his thoughts on Boris. Boris Johnson has had his chance and he blew it. He wasn't able to keep the confidence of conservative members of parliament. So I think that to go back to the psychogrammer of the Johnson premiership would be a great mistake and I hope people don't make that mistake. Okay, so Anna, I'm just trying to wrap my head around all of this. We could potentially be talking about the return of Bojo. What does this process actually look like? How could we ultimately get to a new PM by Monday? Yeah, we could get there by Monday if MPs managed to decide between themselves, Kayleigh. So there is a new process, a quicker process put in place to give us a new Prime Minister by latest Friday of next week. But it could come by Monday if MPs decide between themselves and that happens by putting a maximum of three on the list that MPs will vote on Monday, get that down to two and then maybe the person who comes second, they'll be an indicative vote on the final two by MPs and the person who comes second, they'll be a lot of pressure on that person to possibly stand down. So that's how we could get to an answer by Monday night. Like that doesn't happen, it goes out to the members of the Conservative Party, the people who favoured Liz Truss last time around and we'll see what they pick. But that's the idea that we could get a vote by Monday if not Friday. Yeah, well, maybe you don't want to give them a vote again considering what they did last time. It seems to me that if you're looking to do what's best for the country, Rishi Sunak makes sense as he was right all along and it took really his policies in a different way from a different man to set things straight in markets. On the other hand, if you're worried about the next election, the Conservatives are behind by what, 30 points right now. So they have very little to lose in bringing back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5228,2022-10-21 09:39:15
16823," and if you're worried about the next election, the conservatives are behind by what, 30 points right now. So they have very little to lose in bringing back a popular, if controversial figure like Boris Johnson because high risk, high reward. Yeah, so just to go to those polls, the latest polls I saw just one out this morning, polls, the conservative polling just 14% of the electorate with the Labour Party on 53. That is the gap between the two of them and the latest one unprecedented territory I'm told by political commentators on that front. In terms of who's in the running, both of the names you mentioned have their supporters and both of them have their detractors. Boris Johnson, his supporters say he has a mandate. He won by that massive majority in 2019. His detractors, of course, point to the fact he's still under investigation by the committee on privileges in the House of Commons. That could come back to haunt him. And we know in the words of Michael Howard, the former Tory leader, the psychodrama that went along with his leadership previously, Wishi Soonack, the former chancellor, his back, will look at what a great crisis he has had. He absolutely saw this coming and shouldn't we put someone in place who saw this coming. So a safe pair of hands might lead you in the direction of Wishi Soonack, but then those on the Boris Johnson camp really have an axe to grind with Wishi Soonack because they blame him for bringing down Boris Johnson in the first place. And that's where we stand. But those two names very much to the four, also Penny Morden, who did pretty well in the previous campaign, we'll see somebody to watch. All right, so a lot of players in the game, Anna, and we'll see who wins, although they're gonna have their own game to play after that.

16824," on the political turmoil that has seized the UK. So let's now get a view on what that means for alternative investments and specifically real estate. Joining us now is Isabelle Scumama, global head of AXA Investment Managers. All she oversees 144 billion euros of an alternative business unit, which is the number one real estate investment manager in Europe. Isabelle, thank you so much for joining us. If we could just narrow our focus to the UK to start obviously political turmoil with the resignation of Liz Trust, but that comes against a backdrop of higher interest rates that are likely going to move even higher due to inflation, how does all of that impact your world and the investments you're willing to make in the UK? Good morning. So, yeah, when we talk about real estate or alternative, it's long term view. We are investing over periods of more than 10 years, generally. So what's happening in the politics or the volatility of the market? We have to look through the cycle and to look more long term if we really want to deliver and to perform. Now, interest rates are, of course, some consequences. And the first one is that it force all the market to reprise. We have seen that on the liquid markets. And we can expect that more will come in the course of 2023, notably in alternative assets or a real estate infrastructure. That's something we can have in mind. And, of course, the more leverage investor hard, the more the impact will be. Yes, we can get to thinking about the impact of higher interest rates on real estate and infrastructure, Isabel. Just a linger on the UK for a moment. I've seen some reporting suggesting that some of the pension funds that got themselves in trouble around higher guilt yields were looking to offload other assets, including, in some cases, real estate. Are you seeing evidence of UK asset turmoil spreading into the real estate sector? What we see is a denominator effect that is even tougher in the UK because of this sharp repricing in the UK. So, yes, the long term investors, and notably the UK pension funds are impacted. They have to rebalance their portfolio. They were also forseller of liquid assets just to cope with the margin calls. Having said that, real estate is generally a long-term play. You cannot get rid of your book within a week, within a month. So, we don't see so much evidence of this. There is no forseurs in the market, but more sort of people putting everything on hold. If we continue to see interest rates this high or higher, you'd have to imagine there will be more forseurs in the UK, Isabelle. What does that mean for your business? During the financial crisis, you saw some big funds go out and make mass purchases, even of residential properties. Do you expect us to get there? What is for sure? What is true is that the market is a bit dry, for the moment. There is no evidence, no real forseller, and no evidence that there is a real repricing. This will come because refinancing and investors that are leverage will be forced to refinance at higher rates. So, this will trigger forseurs, probably, not coming from institutional investor that will probably be more on hold, but we will see this coming in the course of 2023. Having said that, this will also create opportunities. We were expecting the market to reprise because in bull market, everything tend to price the same. And we need to see a real differentiation and some as said, we'll have to reprise. Of course, to reflect the interest rate, but also to reflect the brand discount. This is something that is very important when talking about real estate. We will have to inject a lot of capex to make those assets green, to align them to a low carbon trajectory. So, the repricing was a need if we want to have a sufficient room to buy those assets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5230,2022-10-21 09:47:55
16825," want to have a sufficient room to buy those assets and perform the appropriate capex investment to just finally can you get more specific about what those opportunities you are looking at are But yeah, we if you talk about real estate in France or to we we purchased several billions a year or so So but we were if I look at real estate specifically we have done a lot on Alternative assets or development because it was less crowded and it was very challenging to buy existing as said because they were super expensive so what we expect is to see more opportunities Not only in the UK market if I look at the UK for us. We are a little bit underweight. So we have room to increase Increase our investments. We have been very active and developing 22 bishops Kate so but there is still room we have also been active in the residential market purchasing recently Dolphin Square in London. So we have room in the UK but also elsewhere to To invest and to invest this time more in existing as said that we can We can manage and Restructure to align them with New ways of working expectation of tenants, but also to one of more Nadiotrojectory as a bell. Thanks so much for joining us isabel skimama there. She is the CEO of AXA I am alternatives. Let's turn back now to the US equity Drama that is Twitter the stock following following as much as 13% in pre-market trading as the Biden administration is Said to be discussing whether or not it should review some of Elon Musk's deals This is the obvious one that comes to mind on national security concerns for more Alex Web of Bloomberg opinion joins us now And I guess this was all kicked off Alex by Elon Musk's tweets they seemed to me pragmatic but to a lot of people very pro Russia and then threats to Lift his Funding of the Starlink satellite Network that has so helped Ukraine in this war Yes, he tweeted a sort of proposal for how to extricate to end the war frankly and they was included Essentially seeding Crimea to Russia then carrying out an independent poll in in Lugansk and Denetsk where they might have the opportunity to join Russia and that is obviously massively against the The view of the international community and of course US policy So it posed the question will actually does do Elon Musk's interests align with US policy goals and so Therefore, how's why I might have kicked off this investigation? So Alex there's a question of how much fundamentals really matter for Twitter at this point because this is essentially just a stock that Purely trades on the probability of this deal going through but on the fundamental story snap earnings from yesterday don't paint a very good picture for any advertising Reliant business how could that inform how this company ultimately is run if Elon Musk does indeed succeed in taking it over Or frankly if he doesn't you know that the Reporting from the Washington Post is that a Elon Musk is looking to cut as many as 75% of the seven and a half thousand jobs at the company But at the same time Twitter itself is looking to if the deal hadn't gone ahead or doesn't go ahead for some reason perhaps to do with an regulatory investigation It will also look to cut 800 million in costs which given its head count would represent sizeable head count cuts as well So either way it's looking you know I would not like to be in the position of a Twitter employee right now where your job future doesn't look terribly secure The thing is in the view when you go to the Bay air and you speak to people there and I was you know there for a month in July and Loads of people say their Twitter employees too many people now does it employ 75% to too many people I don't know that's something we don't know the details of where it works inside It was always inevitable. He was going to cut some jobs. This is a very big number Okay, Alex thanks so much boom bags Alex where with the latest on Twitter the latest on the tech sector of course and Twitter shares very much under pressure before trading starts in New York turning back to the political turmoil in the youth",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5231,2022-10-21 09:52:17
16826," Alex Webb with the latest on Twitter, the latest on the tech sector of course and Twitter shares very much under pressure before trading starts in New York. Turning back to the political turmoil in the UK, I'm very pleased to say joining us now is Margaret Beckett, Labour MP for Derby South and former of course UK Foreign Secretary and somebody who's been serving on and off, but mostly on in the House of Commons since the mid 70s. Margaret, very good to have you with us. Thank you for joining us. I know that the Labour Party has been calling for another election. All opposition parties seem to be calling for that, but it is constitutionally understood that it's okay to hand over power within the party during a parliament and in fact Labour did it back in the in the 2000s. What is the best argument then that you can come up with for why we should have an election given other parties have done this in the past? Yes, it's happened before, usually on one occasion in other words one transfer, one new leader has taken over. Since July, we have now had four chancellors of the exchequer, three home secretaries and we're about to have our third prime minister. I do think the precedent is not perhaps a good guide. Are you expecting to see an election though knowing what you know about politicians and how the Tory majority is unlikely to vote for an election right now? Are you realistically expecting to see one? In about a week's time, we shall get proposals for new boundaries for all of our precincts and it may depend a little bit on what people see there, whether they think it's in their interest to have an election now or whether to wait until they could bring new boundaries in which would be to the advantage of the governing party and have an election then. And a lot depends on whether the Conservative party a panics or secondly, whether they can stomach it their MPs have had under Boris Johnson particularly have had days of being asked to go on the radio television and hotly defend some very unpopular position, which is then changed within less than 24 hours. They feel angry, humiliated and furious. I wonder about how Brexit could change as a result of this. I mean, the Conservative party was forced to do a real U-turn in terms of old favourites, economics, saturate policies and now it seems like the concerns about Brexit are starting to flare up as well. The problems that that's caused for the economy. Do you think we could see it turned around? Well, Brexit has always been part of it because one of the reasons why people favour one candidate more than another comes back to how they voted and what they did about Brexit. So that's an underlying current all the way through as to it's not easy. But you may have noticed that my own party doesn't say that we can reverse Brexit because if you try to reverse Brexit, there are a whole lot of exceptions that successive governments have negotiated over the years as a new applicant, you would lose all of those. So you'd have to join the euro straight away, for example, they did a very, very special deal for the UK, which they may not be enthusiastic about doing at the moment. So, it's Kayleigh in New York. If we could just lean on your experience as foreign secretary and get the foreign perspective, what does leadership turnover like this in the UK mean for its credibility and frankly influence on the international stage? We're a laughing stock everywhere in the world, which is a very depressing prospect for those of us who are used to the British being treated with a degree of respect and regarded as having experience and regarded as being a stable country. At the moment, the things in our governing party are the opposite of stable and that's really quite depressing. Yeah, things have not been so stable. Margaret, just finally, what lessons do you think the Labour Party are? I know you're standing down at the next election, but what will the party learn from the turmoil that more boring and tax and the policies of this trust brought about?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5232,2022-10-21 09:56:33
16827," and at the next election. But what will the party learn from the turmoil that more boring and more and tax and the policies of Liz Truss brought about in the UK? What can Labour learn from that? Well, obviously no Labour government would have been allowed to cling onto power if we'd got ourselves into anything like this mess. But our press is so biased in favour of the governing party that I mean they actually, initially, one of the most fervent supporters of the present government actually applauded that mini-budget that they promptly crashed the markets. So, you know, that's how far they are from reality. So there isn't a great deal we can learn except the importance of unity. The present government is now looking for a unity candidate, but because they all hate each other so much, they're driving difficulty finding one. Nice place to leave the conversation, Margaret. Thank you very much. Margaret Beckett, a Labour MP for Derby South and former UK Foreign Secretary of course, for the Labour Party giving us her thoughts on what's happening in the Conservative Party and in broader UK politics, the search for unity within the Tories carries on then over the weekend that we'll see if they manage to come up with an answer by Monday. This coverage for Westminster continues shortly. This is Blinkback. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in to work with us to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform, probabilities are they're not all non-securities. Now there's another issue which is a reason which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through.

16828," We're probably going to see persistent inflation and that these yields are not all overdone. The real worry is not only about this winter shortages, but also next winter shortages. We have an almost abnormal obsession with all things inflation. And the most part we're seeing is the consumers okay. We'll continue to have a pretty high cash cover. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone. Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Braminson, Tom Keane. It's a Friday on radio and television. We continue today, a special surveillance. Maybe we'll do normal hours today. Now like we did yesterday, thank you all for your comments and our coverage of the resignation of the Prime Minister yesterday. Today, we don't care. Lisa, it's a bond market. Let's reset. It is unreal. And they are connected. The bond vigilantes are taking over. They are coming out in force. We thought that perhaps we'd seen peak hawkishness, perhaps we'd seen peak yields. That was not the case. Yields around the world, whether the U.S. or Germany's surging, to multi-decade highs, at least according to what we're seeing in some places or a decade highs and how much does this reset expectations evaluate? That's reset with Garfield Reynolds of Bloomberg News. He goes back to 1984. And you've let on this, Lisa, it's not about the level of where yields are in that. It's been the persistency of the lift, this distraction, that distraction, the midterms coming up. Forget about it. The persistency of the yield lift is the story of this October. Well said. And what we're seeing is the longest streak of consecutive weekly increases in yield declines in price for the 10-year treasury. How much does this reset the understanding of where equity valuations are? We were talking about resilience in the face of earnings. How much does that change? Simply because the yield equation doesn't give them that freedom. And there's this talk of Powell and Volker. We're going to have Steve Major with us with HSBC in the eight o'clock hour. That's must watch for it. Must listen for global Wall Street. But Lisa, what's so important here is with the 10-year yield, 12 weeks higher yields back to 1984, that sort of edge of that historic Volker moment of about 81-82. And raises issues about whether Larry Summers, whether Bill Dudley, whether they were right, whether the yields can go that much higher than many people ever thought was possible because the markets haven't broken. Because we have seen inflation continue to surprise the upside. And because the global nature of a sell-off that has a consistency we haven't seen in an entire generation. I love for the house hunting this weekend, if you're done with your leaf peeping. Yeah, you're doing a good job. Look at a house. Oh, thanks. It's marked down. 7.32% is my bank rate 30-year mortgage. What level do you use, Lisa, your benchmark yield as we go into the weekend? The mortgage association, right, having that as one. I'm just looking actually to take a page out of your book, leaf peeping, notwithstanding, real yields to me are really speaking to all you. It's a fact that 1.76% on the 10-year, this is adjusted for the market. We have a market expectations for 10-year inflation. How much are we looking at something that is unsustainable? I remember speaking with a couple of investors who thought that 1.5% was the light in the sand. Well, we've blown through that and keep climbing. Well, we're also doing, of course. And thank you, Anna Edwards, on the green. I believe we're going to go there in this hour. This is the reality. There are selected groups looking at a selected airline, which has a selected former prime minister on it. It's supposedly landing at LHR right now. I don't want to say that's happening, but that's the speculation out there. Are you talking about Boris Johnson? It's a selective form. Exactly. That was talking about. It's the previous prime minister, I think, which I think is, is it a prime minister? Okay. So George Canning is not on that airport. George Canning, those who don't know, died in the early 1800s and was the second shortest surveying prime minister. Otherwise, this is really an anomaly. How much are we looking though at? And I keep going back to this. Yes, this is UK specific. Yes, this is turmoil. You could say this is spurred in part by Brexit. You could say this is spurred by the energy crisis and also the inflationary environment. How much is this an example of what we can expect of the bond market taking control? Markets really in the driver's seat at a time when governments are not used to not having their backs. Did you left any deal in Freedom?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5234,2022-10-21 10:05:27
16829," example of what we can expect of the bond market taking control. Markets really in the driver's seat at a time when governments are not used to not having their backs. And you have meanwhile central banks that are not going to finance the deficits by simply buying all of the debt issued. This is a game changer. How much does this change the political environment globally? Let's do a data check, do a brief and get to a true foreign exchange expert. I'm going to talk with a collapse of sterling. It's down one big figure, 111, 211. A 110 prints of big deal, anything through 1.100. It's a huge, you $1 stronger DXY back above 113 gets my view here. And in Jan 151, I'm going to round it up. 151 is stunning. We'll talk about that in a moment. Future's a bit negative here. The VIX because nothing for the week 30 point at 16. We had a 29 for a whisper there. We had a 29 on the VIX and the yield as we've been talking about pick your yield. I go with a 10 year yield lease of 4.27%. All right. Well, today we're looking at the last slew of feds. We have feds for the quiet period, the quiet period beginning. Thank God for the quiet. Right. So we're going to get possibly Charlie Evans. We're not sure at 9.40 AM. He's a Chicago fed president, but John Williams, New York fed president, we'll be speaking at 9.10 AM. Just we'll be speaking throughout the show, but just as a side note, I'm curious. We speak about all the feds big jim bullard kind of in a bit of hot water with question marks around this off the record event at city group. And some people wondering he's saying he's not going to be doing any more private events. Earnings continue today. American Express and Verizon communications within the next 90 minutes or so. The earnings that we have gotten have been, I guess, some strong, some week. And this really highlights the bifurcated nature of the physical goods market, as well as some of the services that continue like that airline, that flood, flight, perhaps carrying a foreign car. I wonder how British Air will do with all their troubles through the pandemic versus what we saw from United and American Airlines as well. Just one final note. Please. In Brussels, European leaders will be gathering to talk about the energy crisis. And we have seen energy prices. It's all for radar. Significantly. What do they say about the United Kingdom? What do they say about where their hands are tied in terms of how much physical support they can provide? The prices come in on gas from hysterics of a couple of weeks ago. And I think it's worth studying over the weekend. I mean, everyone's weekend reading is going to be incredibly rich here. Just starting with the politics of the United Kingdom. But again, I'm going to go back to folks today. Our real focus is going to be on Bond's Steve Major of HSPC. We'll join us in a minute. Futures negative 18. Mark Chandler, his written books on the astrology of foreign exchange, the interdependencies nation to nation. He is chief market strategist of Banachburg. And we start strong with Mr. Chandler this morning. Mark, let me go to global Wall Street. What everybody wants to know. When is the comfortable time for Ministry of Finance in Japan to step in on 151 yen? Do they do it now? Do they do it in the quiet of their weekend? Or do they wait for the Asian Monday morning, our Sunday 7 p.m.? Yeah, it's a great question. High time after they intervened at the end of last month. And I think they did three things. They make the intervention less than successful. First, it was not a surprise. They continued to warn the market. They were planning to intervene. Secondly, they did it unilaterally. That is, there's very little support from, whether it's Europe or the United States for the V.O.J. intervention. And the third thing I think they did is they, by intervening, they did not signal a change in policy. And so what we were telling our clients was that the only thing worst in intervention was failed intervention. And I think that's what's happened. And so I think the bank of Japan's in a tough position. If they do intervene, it probably won't be as successful as a last bout. They spent $20 billion practically to get maybe a week's night, a week's night with a pleasant sleep. Mark, the Chandler word for acceleration, for a rapid advancement is convexity. There's clear convexity in the unraveling of Japanese Yan Turkish lira in that do you anticipate a fourth quarter in the 2023 of acceleration in these trends, or can we find stability? That's a million dollar question at a time. I think that the dollar is close to a top, partly because I think that Fed policy, as the market's got a price, didn't they're 5% now, that the 75 basis point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5235,2022-10-21 10:09:40
16830," I think that the dollar is close to a top, partly because I think that Fed policy, as the market's got a price in there 5% now, that the 75 basis point hike in early November and again in December and another rate hike early next year. I think that inflation is close to a peak. Even if the core rate is too sticky, I think here's what I'm looking at. Please. The annualized rate of CPI was over 10%. In Q2, the annualized rate of USCPI headline was still above 10%. Q3 felt about 2%. So I'm looking at inflation and becoming off. I know that it's very controversial right now. Many people have been burned calling for this before. I think that we're coming to the tail end of this historic dollar move. I think the Bank of Japan and the PBOC, the central bank of China, are basically playing for time until Fed policy peaks until the market brings the dollar back off of these historic levels. Does this mean simply that it doesn't matter what happens in Europe that this is entirely a fed story from your vantage point and peak inflation in the US and that it's not necessary to see a material turning around in a European region that seems like it's heading into a really difficult moment? Yes, I agree with that, Lisa. I think that for me, there's two big drivers here. One of course, Fed policy, everybody knows about that. I think what's less appreciated is that there's been a serious deterioration of Europe's trade balance as well as Japan's. So the deterioration of the external accounts, as economists would call it, I think is another factor weighing on the currencies. But I think in most of the immediate sense that once the Fed would announce today maybe a Fed speech says that we're done. I think you see the dollar drop very sharply. Mark, you've just driven the 10 year real yield ever higher rounded up. We're up at 1.78%. We've moved mightily like 88% to my study of 2.05%. Is somewhat of a normal 10 year real yield. Where's your number on that? What is a normal 10 year real yield? Yeah, kind of truth. I don't have a clue. And I say that because I say that part of the question. Do these things like a real yield, R-star, you can't touch them. There's sort of abstractions, there's statistical abstractions. And I think that when you look at Fed funds rate, which I really, what I focus on for the real rate, I think we're still looking at a negative real rate on Fed funds. And typically looking for, oh, for the out to the two year, you get a positive two year yield, real yield. And we don't have that yet. But I think this is a different cycle. And I think that because it's an unusual cycle, it's all these shocks, whether it's COVID, whether it is the supply shock, whether it is Russia's invasion, I'm just not sure that these benchmarks are very useful right now. This is really, really important folks. This is why we have Chandler leading off today because he does not have a clue. There's a question about that. And also he moves away from the usual statistics and looks at a benchmark for Chandler and Banachburn of 2%. That was brilliant. I think that should be our mantra. To tell you the truth, I don't have a clue. Pharaoh tells me that on the day. Very sphero. The sphero coming back. You know, he's not coming back because you said he's playing Futsi with the Dow. He said, you know, a zero has quoted from his paper last night. I thought it was pretty good. A pendant six. It's just negative 21. Yes, we will speak of London. We are going to go to parliament here is the quick battle heats up for a new prime minister. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Kayleigh Lions. Ukraine's foreign minister says he talked with Israel's prime minister about Kiev's request for defense systems to help combat Russian missiles and Iranian-made drones. Israel has offered to assist Ukraine with a missile warning system, but says it will not provide weapons. The U.S. has accused Iran of sending trainers and technicians to Crimea to support Russian drone attacks. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the blocs energy crisis. It comes after Germany yielded to pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. The European Council's president says the move sends a clear signal to the market that the bloc is ready to act together.

16831," to act together. The Biden administration is said to be discussing whether the U.S. should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews. So we'll say that would include the Twitter deal and SpaceX Starlink Network. U.S. officials are uncomfortable with what they see as Musk's increasingly Russia-friendly stance and is plans to buy Twitter with foreign investors. Adidas has issued a fresh, profit warning as unsold goods pile up and consumer demand and weekends across China and Western markets.

I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by you, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's sustained. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level or it's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. Today's CFOs are reshaping the seasweet, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Mary O'Sleenio Berg.

A big question is can it go lower or seems a pretty bad earnings already for those who have reported with exclusive expert analysis. Which aspects of the market are not sufficiently priced? Is this a macro huge headwind? There is some really bright light at the end of this tunnel. is this floor going to come when can I start buying? Bloomberg Television and Radio, the fastest numbers and analysis you trust. We've seen the power of the markets over the last few weeks. I think Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was getting on top of that, putting together a package that would have been reassuring to the markets on the 31st of October. Clearly what we mustn't do now is anything which signals to the markets, more chaos, instability and uncertainty. From the time of Theresa May, Lord Hammond, he's the former Chancellor of the Exchequer for the United Kingdom, with a view on his party. There are many views this morning to say the least. It is a movable feast, and again, we say thank you to our team and particularly to John McLeod, our editor-in-chief for Wisdom yesterday in the chaos. I believe it is less chaotic yesterday. Tom McKenzie is at Westminster and picks up the pieces for us this morning. Tom, I want to do Civics 101, which I believe is in the United Kingdom when you want, you can change the rules. We are going from account of 20 MPs to get to five or six candidates, whatever, to 100 MPs to get the two or three candidates. Who decided the Conservative Party could change the rules? So that was the back bench. Well, that was the 1922 committee, Mr Brady, who chairs that committee. You're absolutely right within this system. They do have the power. He does have the power with that committee to change the rules in terms of how they select the leader of the Conservative Party. They've done that, of course, on this short and radically shortened time frame, as you say. We could have a Prime Minister, a new Prime Minister in place, but at the end of play, Monday, the deadline is for the 28th, so Friday, of course, in terms of when they get that new leader. The jostling, of course, and the horse trading continues in the House as a Parliament. Behind me, the last count was, according to the BBC, that Rishi Sunak is currently leading with 44 MPs who have come out to support him. But Boris Johnson, as well, a lot of reporting these cuts short a holiday and he's coming back as well to throw his hat in the ring. That is not confirmed, there's not official. Rishi Sunak, Penny Mordant and Boris Johnson, none of them have officially thrown their hats in the ring yet, but they are the three leading contenders. The key question is, for the markets, what happens to October 31st, when the new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, had said he wants to pronounce and come out with his fiscal plans, which we checked by the Office of Budget Responsibility. That is crucial for these markets. Now that date is very much in question, Tom. Tom, how much is it really important for a lot of the members of Parliament that they get a candidate who's going to keep Jeremy Hunt, who's going to keep the status quo, who is not going to pressure the Bank of England, to be less aggressive? Well, Jeremy Hunt has unarguably done something of a decent job in terms of getting the premium on UK assets down after that mini budget. Yeels have come off at the Pound Strength. And in today's market action, there is that volatility back again. Of course, we're seeing yields up in the Bound under pressure. But on the back of his ability to unpick that trustonomic plan and to, of course, got it, most of it, 90% of it, he did restore something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5238,2022-10-21 10:23:08
16833," the pressure. But on the back of his ability to unpick that trustonomics plan and to of course gut it, most of it, 90% of it, he did restore something of some stability across these markets and most of the guests that would be speaking to say they would like to see the Chancellor remain in place important for investors. Here's the question though, when Boris Johnson, if he does confirm he's running, we know there is animosity, deep animosity between the current Chancellor Hunt and Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson takes the number one spot on Monday, then there is a clear question as to the longevity of the Chancellor who has done some work to restore at least partly the stability across UK assets and of course that sense of credibility in the markets. Tom, how vulnerable is the Tory party right now? How much is Labour making some inroads at a time of incredible deterioration and popularity? We've spoken to a former strategist with Boris Johnson, worked with him on that successful 2019 campaign very closely, it's only for 12 years and he says it is not hyperbole to talk about the future of this Conservative party, given just how deep and how entrenched these divisions are and actually, Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson are really symbolic of that deep entrenched division. Rishi Sunak of course on one side, the more modest, the more moderate parts of the party, Boris Johnson of course who led the Brexit campaign. So you have the right wing parts of the party but also the growth routes are very much in line with Boris Johnson. Rishi Sunak though supported by the moderates but not so much amongst grassroots members of the party. So a split this Conservative party is not out of the question longer term. Tom, you know, debar from the Beatles here from a few years ago and I guess it's happening right now according to his father, fluent from NASA BOAC and so maybe it is Boris Johnson to the rescue. How does he treat now after the scandals with the Labour voters who chose to vote for Prime Minister Johnson a number of years ago? Has he lost them forever? That is a key question. It's worth reminding viewers as you've just done that he did come through with this dumping majority in the election that won over these former Labour seats but he has also faced all of these scandals. Within the party, 148 members of his own party voted against him in a confidence vote outside of Parliament. The popularity of Boris Johnson has declined on the back of all of these scandals. It's also worth noting that he faces a parliamentary investigation as well that would haunt him if he does indeed throw his attenuer in and if he does end up being the leader once again of this Conservative party on this country. Tom McKenzie with our British team here on Bloomberg.com UK outside of Parliament this morning. Lisa, what we do is we look at the litmus paper and it's not good this morning's sterling weekends. And this to me is really telling given the lack of certainty with the path forward as well as what it will take and this goes to a John Michael the White was saying yesterday, what it will take to restore credibility to a nation that has seen a pretty significant blow. Let's just put this in a perspective. Whoever comes in next will be the third Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for this year. It comes at a time when you've seen Bondy old search the highest levels in more than a decade and it comes as the Bank of England has tasked with tightening policy at a rate that many people are uncomfortable with, including some of the candidates that have been named to possibly see at Lys Truss. And just to pause here Chris Hayes at a word MSNBC had on a tweet yesterday, which was very quietly Prime Minister Truss shaking the hand of Queen Elizabeth II. And all Chris said was this was seven weeks ago. That's a fast things of move. And that's why it was sort of poetic that she handed in a resignation after 44 days as Prime Minister to the king after accepting the Prime Minister ship from the Queen. There is sort of upheaval in a nation facing a difficult winter. Cannot be over. Yeah, the difficult winner is seen in the bond market and in foreign exchange as well. We're going to continue to follow the other story in the United Kingdom, politics of it. But of course the ramifications back to the city and the global Wall Street. And I want to go again, I can report this morning folks sterling is broken down. We're back to 111-14 nowhere near 107. But any immigration of that under 110 would be shocking and would change this political race. To be very fair though, this is a global story and it comes with dollar stress.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5239,2022-10-21 10:26:58
16834," But any immigration of that under 110 would be shocking and would change this political race. To be very fair, though, this is a global story. And it comes with dollar strength, that comes with yields higher, dramatically higher in the cases of some denominations in the United States. And to me, that is one of the biggest stories, if not the biggest story of this year. And how long it takes to have a cup of tea, it's real simple, the real 10-year-yield printing a legit 1.78%. Claudius Sam soon. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to be a very good person. I want to be an area of money when I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be... You've got to show up. And you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. You just... Even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance, because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over a place, and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. When US inflation numbers are released... The score is in Flation 1 Fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at Terminal Speed. Co-CPI in America, 40-year high. The yields are absolutely flying. I could ease down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? We are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? I don't want to shift, just keep standing and push down. Now it looks like we're going into extra-annies. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get all night. Well, yes, that. Bloomberg Television.

16835," I'm Bloomberg surveillance. We welcome all of you on a Friday staggering into the weekend and you need reading. Here's my first read of the weekend. John Bern Murdock over at the FT with an absolutely brilliant piece on what he calls the opacity of Chinese data. He's being polite. He's got a couple charts that just are jaw-dropping about how the economic data structure of China is radically different than what it was five or six years ago. We await GDP sometime before Christmas. I think is what we're looking at the data. Equities weaker, futures negative 21, VIX does nothing 30.1A. Yield yield yield is the story of Ramau, which is all fired up 4.28%. Ten year yield, real yield is stunning. 1.78% is not 1.61%. Dollar demonstrably stronger today and sterling with the headlines. I'm going to get a 110 handle on sterling here in a bit 1106. That is a much weaker sterling. Yen 151 is in its right and on story in the Sunday morning as well. Is it always good to have somebody come into the studio who has a relationship, a ratio, an economic belief that's picked up by Fred. This is very, when you have your name and the database of Fred, you're on the edge of rock stardom. Well, let's bring in the rock stardom. Let's do it. Claudia Sam, what is it? Why don't you go to Lisa? I know you're all shaped up right out of Michigan with all sorts of discussion and analytics on one a recession is a recession. Yeah, and what comes is she's been in the Fed. She's worked on the inner workings of this body that has been at the forefront of global economics and markets where we are right now with respect to Fed speak. Do you think that it is accurate pricing to look at a 5% Fed funds rate for the first half of next year and think that that will be what it takes and that this is going to not torpedo the economy as much as perhaps people are pricing in. I think at this point, anyone that's talking about the first half of next year, there's a lot of false confidence. I would not be surprised how fragile financial markets are that the Fed has to pause to get them back under control. Right? I mean, the US financial markets are in a good place right now, but if nothing else, the UK has shown us how fragile to an event to a bad policy decision. So I don't feel confident about what they're going to do in December. Let alone where we're going to be by June of next year. I know, Tom, thanks to the parlor game of Fed speak and what they're going to do or what aren't they going to do. It's not very instructive. There is a question about the consistency of the Federal Reserve from a personal level and we talk all the time about Fed speak and how much of it there is. The latest, Jim Bullard, the St. Louis Fed president, has been reported to have given a private off the record event at City Group, two hedge funds and bankers. Reporters were not invited. This is causing a firestorm. Even former Fed officials are coming out and saying this does not look good. What's your reaction to this at a time when people are looking to the Fed for leadership? It's inexcusable. And to me, it's not an optics problem. It's an ethics problem. Jim Bullard is one of the Fed officials that is making decision about rate hikes that have effects in the United States. We'll have effects for US workers and they are having effects around the globe. The idea that he gave any kind of private remarks to investors is outrageous and he should go. Members of his preacher did a tour to force in the telegraph on modern theory and it's like thereof. He tore apart the Phillips curve and the belief in it right now from the early 50s, 80 Phillips at London School of Economics. He tore apart the beverage curve which Krogeman believes in this out of beverage of middle century London School of Economics. Is there a theory right now or are we making it up as we go? They're following a theory that is so outdated. What is the theory they're following? The Phillips curve. So this tradeoff between unemployment and inflation is at the core. Do you observe that right now? I can see that in their logic. This is why they're waging a war on workers trying to get the labor market to quote unquote soften. They think that's what it takes to get inflation. This is your way. I interrupt. This is Claudius Tom's wheelhoss folks. I'm going to make this clear as I can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5241,2022-10-21 10:35:36
16836," to quote-unquote soften, they think that's what it takes to get inflation. This is your way, I interrupt. This is Claudius Sam's wheelhoss folks. I'm going to make this as clear as I can. If the Phillips curve doesn't work, what is the relationship of monetary theory to our labor, our complex labor dynamics? So we can use the tools like the Phillips curve, but there is so much supply driven inflation. They, the speed at which they are going, the speed at which they need to think, they think they need rates by the next half of the year, that's, you can't use that tool for that. And there's a lot of research. It turns out we've done research since the 1958, and they're not using it. They're trying to excuse away. It's all demand-driven. And if it is, the Fed does that. And the Fed is being very impatient, and it's hard to watch. If we are exposed, if we are after the fact, what is the data we should look at if we are exposed? Claims isn't getting it done, isn't it? Because jobs claims look extraordinary right now. They look fully employed, frankly. In a very unusual way, the Fed has painted themselves in a corner, and said it is all CPI. The consumer price index is the last place that these, the lower producer prices, the lower import prices, any kind of weakening, which we're already seeing, that's the last place it shows up. And they've told us they will not stop until it shows up there. But earlier this year, you were talking about how we could see even disinflation, right? That we could see inflation roll over pretty dramatically heading into year end. We haven't. And services inflation has really been a big driver. It's not just rents. It's much broader. We just get the results from airlines. They're doing great, even though their tickets are incredibly expensive. So what have you gotten wrong with respect to the pace of the deceleration and inflation? What I've gotten wrong is to look at the macro data. And in talking to businesses now, I mean, they have excess inventories. Like, why aren't you cutting price? I mean, inflation is business decision. They're the ones that write the price. And what they say is the consumers are here. Why would we cut back? And so I think the process of some of the supply disruptions, whether it's people coming back to work, whether it's like getting the goods here faster or the strong dollar feeding through, it's taking a lot longer than I would have expected when I talk to business owners. I'm like, that makes sense. Well, but this is the concern for the Federal Reserve. And possibly the reason why they are being as aggressive as they are. Because they had waited too long in the past. And that arguably is the reason why inflation accelerated to the pace that it did. If there is this uncertainty about why it's not coming down more, there is a big risk to not raising rates substantially. Isn't that right? We're not in the 1970s. There was a decade of high inflation where the Federal Reserve was asleep at the wheel. We've had like less than two years of high inflation. And the Federal Reserve has gone in big this year. Mortgage markets are showing us, wow, like these are big increases and they're really fast. And we know long and variable lags. Like it takes time. And we also know that the rental market what's happening right now, those prices are coming down. The Fed knows this. And they're going fast and hard. It folded the international events here. I was thunder struck at the IMF meetings. How the adults down there have a much longer time frame back, 40 or 50 years. And they're much more looking at international dislocations than the parlor game of inflation rate dynamics. At what level is Jerome Powell's central banker to the world driving the policy of all these different nations? The Fed is absolutely in the driver's seat. I mean, the dollar has strengthened so much. He is pushing the ECB to raise rates. The Bank of England to raise rates. They have absolutely surprised driven inflation. And frankly, they're going to make a bad situation. Worst Europe is headed towards a severe recession. And the Fed is, they are contributing. So what do they do? I mean, we've got a Fed meeting of November 2nd. And after that, let's have Claudia's some market expert come in here and give us a take. Are we way overdoing the parlor game out Fed meeting 2, Fed meeting 3? They need to slow down. They're not going to. I mean, 75 is absolutely happening. 75, 50, 25 would be great. But I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised at all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5242,2022-10-21 10:40:01
16837," going to, I mean, 75 is absolutely happening. 75, 50, 25 would be great, but I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised at all for a 75, 75. Is currency of value to you here? I mean, to study strong dollar in all the different dynamics of Paris. So what a strong dollar does is it means it's cheaper for us to import goods. And we like a lot of cheap goods from abroad. And right at this point, we are doing beggar thy neighbor. We are bringing it with a strong dollar. We are importing disinflation. And we are exporting inflation. And that's good for us. Yay America, but that's not. If we push the global economy into a severe recession, we're not going to withstand that. You come out of the Michigan combine, which is massive inflation analysis, all the different professors and the wonderful groundwork and all the rest of it. Which matters to you now, a services pullback or a goods pullback to disinflation or even outright goods deflation? Which of those two is more important? Well, broadly, we say that the best cure for high inflation is high inflation, right? That consumers need to get price sensitive. They need to pull back. And we're seeing that there has been slowing in the growth of consumer spending. We have rotation away from goods and back to services. It's going to be disruptive. Every rotation we see is disruptive. We need to get back to something that is a semblance of normal. Lisa emails in and she says, would you ask Claudia here about what the inflation warriors are getting wrong? I mean, the inflationistas used to be Chuck Placer in Philadelphia. And now the inflationistas are Larian Dudley. Line them up like ducks. What do they get wrong right now? Well, the Larian Dudley's were right for the wrong reason. This year, last year when they were taught, it was all about the rescue plan, the rescue plan. Well, COVID, Delta, and Omacron, and all the variants, and then Putin showed up, right? So if you don't get the story right for the right reason, you will make very bad forecasts. So they're forecast right now or just, you know, set them to the side. The thing the Federal Reserve is doing is they are so afraid of these inflation expectations taking hold. Those expectations look solid. People believe the Fed is into fighting inflation, right? But they're now worried about, well, they're stable, but they could come unanchored. And rise, and it's like, you really are going to tank the global economy over something we have no signs of. And when they move, they move slowly, right? So it's just, that is their big fear right now, which embedded inflation expectations. You have cats at home. Your new cat, did you really name it pivot? No, she's puffy. Puffy, okay. Claudius, thank you so much for some consulting. And certainly one of our great experts in this nation of the measurement of a path to recession.

You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg.

16839," But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a morade. I think inflation has reached the top. I think it is starting to come down. I think it may come down more slowly than people are hoping because of the stickiness in the shelter cost and the stickiness in labor markets. But as I said, I think the Fed has had a positive impact. One of my favorite people, Jonathan Gray, a blackstone group. If you are young and you make a lot of money, what do you do with it? And this guy more than anyone I know on the island of Manhattan and the five burrows is poning the money to charity. No one like Jonathan Gray. Great to hear from him, Oshinali Basak here, over what Blackstone's doing. Particularly in real estate. So let's take a moment here on that. This is a sensitive issue where in the modern age, fancy people with fancy money are cornering the real estate market in America. And that's part of the blackstone questioning, if you will. Well, and this has been a story for a number of years. Will they continue to be buyers as market rates go up and prices come down? And also how much are they going to raise rates at a time raised rents? Yeah, raised rents at a time when there is this increase and yet there is popular antipathy toward this. Features negative 23 were watching yields Lisa stunned by a 1.78% real yield and that folds into all of our investment calculations on a Friday. We're seeing a macro move. Let's be very clear today has been the best phrase of the day. This is macro. Move yields higher dollar stronger disrupting a lot of different trades. You're seeing that with the Euro weekening. But again, this is a dollar story, 97 37 year, a dollar cross. You could see this in the 10 year yield breaching the highest levels we've seen going back to 2007. What does this do to reset valuations to recent understandings and how much further this has to go. Overall, we've seen both closing Sandwich road to start the contract of motion weighing eerie, Sr macro strategist to and or by looking at the different subcomponents and housing, the different stratification within the consumers are rich consumers, they don't care. They're middle income consumers, some of them do care, they're very leverage. And the ones who are poor obviously, you can't sell so much to target others, have to basically are left with inventory of prices which they've overpriced. And margins are very, very high profit margins. And so we have this big demand, which is coming in with supply, which is an issue. And eventually it slows down lead by the poor, but the middle income and the rich are still doing very well. And the message hasn't completely gone through, that leverage is getting very expensive, that your real estate market is probably over the expensive. And so there's not yet the moment of doubt within US consumer where everything adjusts. And on the corporate side, also, some of the corporates remain in a delusion, they think everything is actually doing well from CEO confidence indeed has fallen a lot, but it's probably led by the people who sell low profit marching type of products, the likes of Apple are a little bit worried, they might fire a thousand people, not very much more. And so we haven't seen that big adjustment both on the household side and the corporate side. When it happens, it happens brutally. That's the issue. We don't know when it's gonna happen. We don't know how much of it exactly has to tighten. It's probably already over tightening, but it has no choice. How close are we Sebastian? Is something breaking in markets before they reach that point? And if you look at equities broadly outside of the United States, they're actually quite cheap. So if you have to make a call as an asset allocated, you can say in the next three to six months, or at least say three to five months, is actually going to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5245,2022-10-21 10:53:11
16840," Look at the equities broadly outside of the United States. They're actually quite cheap. So if you have to make a call as an asset allocated, you can say in the next three to six months or less, they three to five months is actually going to become very interesting for equity investors. From the US side, some of the stars, Nasdaq and the likes still remain very expensive. They're still disbelief in America being a great, a great economy, well-managed economy and being just a great place to invest. And it's not only for your Americans, but pretty much everyone else around the world. And it's part of the reason where the dollar is so strong. Sebastian, you wrote a brilliant essay of optimism on the United Kingdom. You said the comparing contrast with Italy is wrong, wrong, wrong. Explain to us your optimism is the United Kingdom extracts itself from political crisis. And so one of the reasons you can get political instability is because you pander to simply one group within that population and not the entire population. UK has a long history of basically being well-governed and we've seen significant accidents recently. But in general, they just know how to do the right thing, both from the labor side and from the conservative side, not always immediately, but eventually. And so there's a sense that there's a social contract in the United Kingdom. As you can see it, also all around Europe, not everywhere around Europe. And also to some extent, in the United States, and it means that people believe that the Bank of England will eventually do the necessary. The government eventually does it. And Mrs. Tross Ashley resigned. Nobody pressured her. She was on their significant pressure, but she did it by herself. So she considered, OK, this is not good for the country. I will step aside. It doesn't happen in many countries. I got a day trade through to Monday. Am I going to go long-sturling here, Sebastian, helping? Are you, what do you want to do in an FX in general? And preferably is avoided. It's a long experience as a guarantee strategy. What you do want is stay on a long-daw position that is becoming increasingly dangerous both on the d'Auillean side and d'Auille versus the emerging market. We're seeing the remain be weakened consistently on the back of a when must be recession in China. And so it's quite difficult and unfortunately, complex environment. The long-daw story probably still has some legs, but it's becoming very dangerous. Sebastian, thank you so much. Terrific Friday, brief. Sebastian Gellie, always better on Friday when an Nardia asset management is, well, Lisa, I use this word too much, but the swirl that we've been through, not only this week, but the month, or maybe it's eight weeks. I lose track here in this forever-long 2022. I look at the screen and all I can hang on is the inflation-adjusted yield. That's what every guest is focused on. And to be very clear, because people will say, real yields are still very negative. They're not actually positive. If you look at where a yield-worry word inflation is now, this is for what people are gaming out in markets for inflation over the next 10 years. So that means that people think that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates by the most above where that inflation rate is expected to be over the next 10 years going back to 2009. How much, though, does this talk about what we've been discussing for a long time? People keep getting it wrong with inflation, and we don't understand why. The lack of certainty around what the main drivers are in the stickiness of this. I mean, Phil Adolfi of Fred President Patrick Hargreya said. And you said what did he say? He said that the fed's anti-inflation policies are, quote, frankly, disappointing. And he talked about how he expects the yields to be, if it funds rates to be, well over 4% by your end. This is the base case. Yeah, but to me, it's not the level of what the yield is doing. It's going to be the length of that. In the major message I have out of IMF meetings and all that's going on right now, is transitory is just gone. There's no other way to put it. And we're getting comfortable with yields from 30 and 40 and 50 years ago, which leads me into my great theme, I think, for next year, which is the great zombie rollup. What do you do? What do you do in tech if you're an unprofitable company? How do you drive that forward? You're seeing it certainly in the share prices. Did you see Snap? I mean, I lost a career that's value after. I'm not what they did. Well, yeah, exactly. It's all because of Utah. Only you would endorse that. All of these companies that you're seeing that really blew up during the pandemic and expanded have been deflating bubbles over the past couple of months and just continue to be so. 113DXY, the YAN 151.34 is newsmaking through your weekend to the Asian Sunday mornings.

So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a Distress Dead investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Bloomberg, your global business authority. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will know. We're probably going to see persistent inflation and that these yields are not overdone. The real worry is not only about this winter shortages, but also next winter shortages. We have an almost abnormal obsession with old things and inflation. In the most part, what we're seeing is the consumers okay. People continue to have a pretty high cash coffer. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5247,2022-10-21 11:01:27
16842," This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Good morning everyone, Jonathan Farrow, Lisa Brae once in Tom Keane on a Friday on Radio on television and what you need to know. Well, we're going to go to Tom McKenzie, a parliament on the Derby in the United Kingdom. It is an odd Friday in the United Kingdom after the history that we saw yesterday. We are going to try to steer through the next two hours. We're Steve Major to join us with HSBC year on yields. Lisa, it has been secondary this week. It deserves, as you say, to be the macro story. A 10 year real yield can't get out of its way, 1.78 percent. Bonn markets are taking charge in a global economy and the global political regime that I could arguably say, given what happened in the UK. How much does this really tie the hands of fiscal policy makers that have gotten used to central bankers that will buy their bonds and bond markets that will give them cheap financing at a time where yields start surging to the highest levels in worth it. And surging is the right word. I mean, as we go into the jobs report, as we go into November 2nd and a fed meeting, the answer is there's a dynamic here into that meeting we didn't see two, three weeks ago. And part of this is driven by that tension that we were parsing out with Claudio Sam. This idea of the fed is moving further than people had imagined they ever would or could simply because we have been surprised again and again with the inflationary impulse and how durable it is and how strong it is. And it's not just the US, it's Canada, it's United Kingdom, it's the European region. You know, I look here at the Bloomberg index and this is the blend folks that you see on the Bloomberg total return index. There's like eight or nine ten of them and there's one that you center on negative 18 percent in widening out every day a price decline in bonds. And a price decline that people are saying is resetting yields to a level where they're sort of becoming attractive, but the marginal buyer is not yet coming in. And I know that you have your thoughts on that. But how much is this a reset to your point about how long rates remain at this level? A reset in corporate America in the global corporate sphere with roll ups with potentially companies going bankrupt. Right now we're not seeing that price into the market and earnings have held in at least for the most part. Sunday night, Phillies, Padres, maybe Yankees, Astros, maybe Ministry of Finance, maybe we may get in our Sunday night at one fifty one on yen. Maybe we need to pay attention. I know, right? One fifty one climbing in terms of the dollar versus the yen and at what point they step in? What's the line in the sand? Right? People were saying it was one fifty. Search through that. They before said it was one forty five or well past that. And how much do we keep going? And are they just simply going to try to control the pace of the deterioration of the weakening in the yen versus the dollar versus outright support it? And Friday, not that many earnings on Friday. American Express comes in with a report. We'll go over it two seconds here. Revenue up 23 percent or supposed to be up 25 percent. I mean, that's what their their view is. That seems like they'll seem like ginormous numbers. And yet it trades off a little bit here. They see their forward guidance is not so. Yeah, the full year earnings per share is estimated to be nine in a quarter, nine dollars and twenty five cents to nine dollars and sixty five cents. The estimate was nine dollars and ninety cents. This is actually really quite important given. This could be a bell weather on wealthier individual spending and whether they could be cutting back as well. I don't know. We haven't seen it in the early years. The claim Bloomberg headlines on American Express. Here's one American Express haven't seen changes in consumer spending. And the next headline is reddo keeper of the M excess time stop spending. So there's some of the the granularity that you've got data. Let's do it right now before the brief futures negative seventeen doubt futures negative one under the VIX critically above thirty the VIX has gone nowhere this week. That in itself is a story. The curve inversion a little bit less in that ten year real year one point seven seven percent on dollar strength. Yeah, we're looking also at a slew of fed speak and I really do have to harp on this Patrick Harker comment on yesterday about how is this appointing how the fed tightening has worked so far and where the CPI has come in. We do hear from John Williams New York fed president nine ten Charlie Evans is expected to speak Chicago for president at nine forty eight and also today earnings.

16843," at 910, Charlie Evans was expected to speak. Chicago for president at 940 AM. Also today earnings. We did just touch on American Express, which just came out in about a half an hour. We'll get Verizon communications. It's been hit or miss, right? It has not been consistent. We have about a quarter of the earnings coming in at this point. And it's really been hit or miss. American Express missing to me is very interesting. I'm curious to parse through and understand. Okay, if their spending habits aren't changing, why is revenue coming in low? What I don't get here, Verizon, 10-year total return per year, 2.83%. I don't know what to do with that. Well, this was what we were talking about yesterday. Utilities have been chugging in at less than junk bonds in terms of the returns. Does that change? I mean, how many people have come on the show and said utilities are the place to be because they're haven't been bit up. They haven't done the same thing. All right, we're also going to be hearing from European leaders today. And this, to me, is something I am just sort of keeping an eye on. This is the second day of a summit in Brussels. Talking about price caps, talking about which to the energy crisis. I know. What's important about this here? So explain for our American audience, what's the so what are Brussels this morning? Two things. Number one, I want to see what they have to say about Liz Truss' resignation. And where the bond markets have been pricing different plans to try to address the energy crisis. And then I want to understand, okay, crisis over, we see a natural gas prices in Europe plunging on the likelihood that they have higher stores. So what do they have planned for the winter after? Have the winter after that. Okay, Tom McKenzie here in a bit will give us an update from parliament. Right now, your conversation of the day of a diversified portfolio. Sarah Hont joins us portfolio manager at Alpine Sex in which we'd love to have her on with the linkage here of all the media babble and what do you actually do in the equity market? Sarah Hont much cash to you hold right now. We would say that we're holding higher than normal cash levels. So if normal is somewhere between zero and five, maybe you're closer to five to 10 or some, in some cases over that, I think that this is a very difficult time in the equity markets as we've seen. The volatility has just been much wider than expected. And we have had the markets come down in multiple compression before we really get an earnings reset. And I think that's the biggest issue going forward besides what the Fed is doing. It's the earnings reset. And we haven't really seen that yet. And I think it's coming. And given that you think it's coming from another people do too, I wonder how much Chris Harvey really was ahead of the curvy yesterday when he was saying that he downgraded banks to neutral from overweight, even after they just reported better than expected earnings because it offered a pop of the market that gave him a good exit point. How much are you looking at earnings to basically cash in or out of the sectors that you don't like on some sort of strategic level regardless of what the earnings actually said? Well, I think what we're looking for on the earnings side is more consistency than trying to cash in or cash out. I mean, I think the banks have a tough road ahead of them to given the fact that you still haven't in a very yield curve. And so I think that as much as they've had good numbers so far, I think that that is why people are a little bit concerned about them going forward. I think that the hard thing is you just look at every different piece of this market and you're getting some good news and some bad news. Like, UNP said that they're worried about stuff. CSX said they weren't as worried about going forward, Carlos. So I think that there's just a lot of uncertainty between companies and everybody else right now. And I think that I just don't see how S&P which consensus has higher next year. I don't see how that doesn't have to change before we start to get more comfortable with where equity valuations are because the multiple compression has happened but the E is still expected to be higher next year than it is this year. Let's just put a bow on that, Sarah. Does this earnings season so far make you more or less bullish on riskier assets in the months to come? I don't know if that does either. I think really, I mean, this goes back to what are you looking for? We're looking for companies that can both grow their dividends and have some consistent earnings power. That's a true different cycle. So I mean, I think that this earnings season isn't really changing that. The fact that Adi does just came in after Nike with bad numbers and everyone saying the consumer is so great. I think there's just a huge disparity in what's going on in different places where people are spending. And I think it's really hard to game that out at the time and think that you know exactly where you're going to be correct.

16844," A lot of really good conversation on this show about the new regime for equities. What does the Sarah Hunt new regime look like if you get an actual real yield and actual risk-free rate? Well, you guys have talked a lot about on this show about the fact that it's hard to price risky assets when you're still repricing the risk-free rate, right? So that's part of what some of the volatility is about right now. I think historically speaking, it's not unusual to have rates maybe not in the 5-6% range, but maybe in the 3-4% range. And I think that there will be an adjustment to that and part of that adjustment has been the multiple compression that we've seen so far. The problem on top of that is that we are probably facing recession if we're not already in one now. And we certainly are concerned about global growth. And not just you us growth, but growth everywhere. And I think that part of that, you've got energy prices that are problematic. You've got food prices that are problematic. Some of that on the back of Russia Ukraine, there's a lot going on. So I just need some advice. Do I buy Apple this morning? We like Apple. I think that the market gives you opportunities to pick everything up a little bit cheaper, and this is what we've seen so far. So there's a lot of stocks that we like. I think if Apple's more of a staple than a tech company because nobody can live without their phones or their iPads, I think that there are some places in the tech world that we like. Right. So the whole group is being sold together for the most part, although Apple has held in better than a lot of its compatriots. There's your band this morning. Hunt Apple is a staple. Sarah, thank you so much. Alpine sex and woods as well. Let's digress to tech chat right now. Your house to various offspring have lined up the marginal, the next Apple item that needs to be bought. No, in my household, they have. I think I like four out. Seriously, they have, they have antiquated tech that they sort of line up and have multiple screens in front of their. Yeah, no, but it's funny. They have like five screens and they kind of switch from screen screen. I'm basically fantastic mother as you can tell. I can tell. It's amazing. It's just, it's amazing. It's, this is really important actually with all the, you know, the macro babble we do. Some of these stocks are staples like toothpaste. Yeah, although you possibly aren't buying as many orbs of any upgrades, if the kids can actually go outside and play with their friends rather than during the pandemic where they couldn't. I'm just saying that, you know, now there is an alternative and you can kind of say, you know, guys, get off the streets and they can say, no, we don't want to. Do you remember that? You can try really hard and dollar. I've digressing you. Dollar straw, you just, you're just going down and flames. Steve Major in the next hour. Stay with us. Dollar stronger. Good morning.

The U.S. has accused Tehran of sending trainers and technicians to crime me to support Russian drone attacks. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the block's energy crisis. It comes after Germany yielded to pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. The European Council's president says the move sends a clear signal to the market that the block is ready to act together. The Biden administration's officials are said to be discussing whether the U.S. should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews. This is to say that would include the Twitter deal and SpaceX's Starlink network. U.S. officials are uncomfortable with what they see as Musk's increasingly Russia-friendly stance and his plans to buy Twitter with foreign investors.

16845," [♪将합acs music playing [♪ Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like Cartier-Lerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

16846," For it's Lash Now, where the music plays on, the SOC's and sponsor Bank of America. Written in crisis. I am resigning as leader of the conservative party. The shortest ever-serving Prime Minister. Trust Bloomberg for the fastest coverage and instant expert analysis. She is a general election enough to begin to restore some of the credibility. It takes a long, long time for the markets to forgive you. You are now from an economic point of view, tinkering. Brexit has not gone away. To wake up call here for the conservative party. For continuing coverage, keep attuned to Bloomberg Television and Radio. We have fixed a high threshold, but a threshold that should be achievable by any serious candidates who has a realistic prospect of going through. A threshold of 100 members of parliament nominating a candidate for the whole of Brazil, for three candidates, potentially to come forward. Graham Beatty for the conservative party. The minister, Brady, is the one making the rules. Maybe he's like the head referee at the NFL Games this weekend. We welcome all of you on Radio and Television to a most interesting Friday. John Farrow's off. Lisa and I are really trying to focus on bonds, on stronger dollar. On Yen Week, around it up, a 152 yen is stunning. Yes, even we on this Friday must turn to the United Kingdom. And we do so. The movable feast does BBC just has the esteemed defense secretary Ben Wallace. He will not run. And I think the major message for Americans on this Friday is don't we wish in America we had the timeline of this race. Wouldn't it be great to have a midterm election or presidential cycle that goes to 9 a.m. on Monday? It is 9 a.m. Monday. We're going to find our time, our time. What happens in terms of leadership? I don't think that anyone in the UK would say they're in an enviable position right now in terms of some of the Tom Ald. We do, of course, though, think that we have an enviable position in terms of our bench of people who have been covering this. Tom McKenzie right now at Westminster of our Bloomberg here. And I'm wondering, Tom, you're watching all of the MPs come out with flags saying who they're going to vote for. Who's the front runner right now? What the front runner remains, Richie, Sunack, of course, the former Chancellor, but also the person who triggered, of course, that pushback that eventually led to Boris Johnson being forced out. And that is alienated here amongst large sues of this Conservative party. So we're looking at the daily telegraph. That is the Conservative leading newspaper. They're quite well sourced. They've come out with around 48 MPs now backing Sunack 37, though for Boris Johnson and 16 for Penny Morden. What the reminding viewers, none of these three candidates have officially confirmed that they are in fact running. But that's where we are in this. We are monitoring the number of MPs coming out, putting their names behind these candidates. And as you said, we could have a new Prime Minister, a new leader of the Tory party and a new Prime Minister, the United Kingdom, as soon as the end of play Monday, the first ballot. As you said, 9am US time, 2pm UK time, the official deadline. They have to have chosen someone by Friday, the 28th. It feels like there's somewhat of an existential question behind this. How much authority the new Prime Minister will have coming in given the diminished influence of the Tory party given the black mark of Liz Truss? What's your view on that? Well, these are politicians now with policies that are being policed by the markets. And that is just mean made ever clearer. You're seeing the volatility again with the pound of the pressure today and yields up. They now know, even the orthodox or unorthodox members of this Conservative party now know that their policies will be closely scrutinised by the markets. And so to that extent, there are the guardrails around the policy making. But then there are the polls that they have to contend with as well that show an historic lead to the Opposition Labour Party. Yes, we are officially two years out from an election. But to what extent can you push through policy when you were divided in your domestic party and you're facing the kind of pressure from voters when it comes to the polls? As you look ahead to those potential elections. Tom, the Sunack Johnson animosity. Is it a personal thing? Is it heaven forbid actual political theory? They disagree on a color? This not hatred. That's too strong a word, but color the political reality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5252,2022-10-21 11:23:19
16847," This not hatred, that's too strong a word, but color the political reality these two face. So we spoke to I was speaking to the former strategist for Boris Johnson earlier this morning. He said this is a personal dispute, they dislike each other personally. There was the tension leading up to, of course, the ousting of Boris Johnson in terms of the policy agenda and the framework, well this former strategist for Boris Johnson said he doesn't really have an ideology. Rishi Sunak does, he's been proven right around the market reaction to this many budget unfunded tax cuts. So on that respect, he has credibility with the market and he has support with at least some factions of the Conservative Party. But he is also the former chancellor deeply alienated those parts of the party. Those members of parliament would also grassroots supporters of the Conservative Party who continue to support Boris Johnson. So the idea that these two would serve together is very unlikely at this point. The other question is if Boris Johnson does win this, what happens to the current chancellor who has done and made some progress in restoring to that? That's right where I wanted to go, just to wrap up your time and my head is spinning on this folks. Yeah. Johnson, who's his chancellor? Sunak, who's his chancellor? What's the game on that right now? Boris Johnson and his chancellor, frankly, very, very difficult to say. You can say that he's going to rule out Rishi Sunak. Absolutely. Does he stick with Jeremy Hunt? Possibly. There is some anonymously on that front. Rishi Sunak wins this. He's currently leading with more MPs backing him a long way to go, of course, into that Monday ballot. Who does he choose to be his chancellor? Possibly someone from the right of the party to try and close that division. My deepest sympathies, Tom McKenzie. Thank you so much for coverage in this election. Thank you so much with coverage in this absolute chaos in the United Kingdom. And at least seriously, to their great credit after whatever it was seven weeks ago, six weeks ago, whatever it was, the madness. The timeline here is just shockingly short. A week from today, they're going to have a prime minister. I think Monday, 2pm their time, we're going to get a real clarity on that. And I don't know what happens between Monday and Friday. What time said there was really a pressure, I think, also. The markets are in control here that basically any conservative member who comes into the office is going to have to run their policies by the market essentially to see whether there is enough stability in the response, whether bond yields don't groomed dramatically, whether you don't have it further sell off in the pound before they are ratified by the public. And this really calls into focus this question about how ten U.S. right now the political system is at a time when there is historically low popularity for the Tory party. No, but to some of this, the vigilantes are tangible. I mean, there's the bond vigilantes, there's the FX vigilantes, and there's the Bank of England vigilantes. I mean, I don't even understand where Governor Bailey fits into this. Well, there's going to be increasing pressure. And there has been already to possibly pull back with some of the rate hikes saying, look, we've got your back with the fiscal policy. We're not going to be a lot of very, you know, spending a ton of money. So at what point does that become a problem for markets as well? Right? You don't have a candidate who can actually call it. Bring that over to the Fed. I'm going to bring up the FOMC screen on the Bloomberg November 2, December 14. And I clicked a little thingy here, and I go out to a long ways away from December 14, February 1, and on to March 22. Where are we in March 22nd of next year? Well, no clue. The market saying 5% and it's saying that we're going to stay there for quite a while. And that to me is sort of a sea change given where we admit massive, no, massive, massive. What does it do to dollar? I mean, that's what you're seeing. Well, you're seeing it do to dollar, right? I mean, you're seeing it shrank than against absolutely everything in torpedo right now.

16848," MUSIC We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them, and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's what shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers.

I've been looking at the big tech names, which we were talking about earlier. Next week, right? Yeah, well, we get the big tech on Thursday, the sort of Amazon behemoths and the Apple, but we got Snap and Snapchat's been on a downward trend pretty significantly. And it is down by more than 25% now, down more than 27% after reporting its slowest quarterly sales growth ever. They miss their estimates. How much does this really speak to a problem in the broader ad-driven tech world? And this is the reason why you're seeing some of the other names sell off in sympathy meta among them down almost 3.6% Google or Alphabet, the parent company, down 1.7%. Again, this speaks to why advertise if you A, don't have the goods to sell, which actually isn't the case anymore if we talk about inventories. But B, if you really don't see the same kind of revenues and your margins are getting cramped and you need to really write size and figure out the business plan ahead, talking about right sizing Twitter. There were reports overnight that it Elon Musk comes out and does buy this company. He plans to cut the staff by 75%. Those shares down by 7% not because of that, but because this morning Bloomberg reporting that US officials are questioning the deal and investigating some of the ins and outs of Elon Musk and what he's done. They read this wonderful reporting from Bloomberg, from Jennifer and the team at Bloomberg. And first of all, this is really serious. Yeah. Really original. Here's a guy who gave technology to Ukraine great. And I don't know the details of that. And I don't have an opinion on that. But this transaction may be held up because that's like a department of defense national security thing. But it highlights Elon Musk as a polarizing figure and someone who really skirts the edges of compliance, the edges of what's okay, including on Twitter. And so how much does this really affect the likelihood of him taking over? And then what does that say about all the job cuts because even before he was playing taking what they had planned cuts for that staff. Right now Verizon out, it looks okay. They're going to quote start cost savings plan. Yeah. Read job cuts. Yeah, I mean, that's basically, oh, can I just say one other thing?

You are not alone. I love that. That really, I think I should use that. These kids today. These kids today. What can we say? What we can say is to speak to Leslie Falkonio, head of US Fixed Income Asset Allocation at UBS 12th Management. Leslie, thank you so much for joining us. And so much of this is the read adjustment to the news flow we're seeing. Are you under a year I had to review yet? Are you still trying to get through the fourth quarter? Well, we're doing a little bit of both. I think that we were trying to understand the fourth quarter to really project the earhead. And I think that one of the interesting things is we look at what's happening in terms of this fourth quarter and how we enter 2023 is that we're seeing these yields in a 10 year that we haven't seen since 2007. You know, you have a lot of a large correction, particularly in fixed income and mostly due to the rise in interest rates, we'll really set the tone for next year. They're going to set the tone for next year. And it's a yield structure back from another time in place. Does that change your equity allocation or the factors that matter in equity that you finally have a risk for yield? Well, I think, you know, as a fixed income person, I look, you know, very closely at the risk for yield and what you're being offered in terms of equity versus fixed income and how much that risk free rate has risen. And whether or not, whether it's high yield or equity investors are compensated by their",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5255,2022-10-21 11:36:22
16850," And what you're being offered in terms of equity versus fixed income and how much that risk free rate has risen and whether or not whether it's high yield or equity investors are compensated by that risk premium given that we have seen this rise in interest rates. And overall, in our opinion, I think the fixed income market is a bit ahead of the equity market, particularly the U.S. equity market. And in those pockets of vulnerability that we're seeing that really haven't adjusted in terms of risk premium, one of the things of sectors such as high yield. High yield has been incredibly resilient this year. If the spreads of 490 or 500, you're maybe at the medium, medium spread. So, we don't think that going forward what investors need to look at is really where the underperformance has come from, mostly has been a rise in yield and whether or not you're really being compensated in terms of your risk premium. Brilliant. And Lisa, this is the heart of what you've been talking about with some parts of credit have moved and other parts have shocked by the lack of movement. Especially in the riskier segments, the more leveraged companies that are hanging in there because they are less rate sensitive. So, let's move that into some sort of investment thesis. I mean, one of the biggest consensus trades that I've heard of recently is investment grade bonds. So many people love investment grade bonds because they have sold off dramatically yields at the highest levels going back to 2009. And yet yields keep rising. What gives? Well, I mean, I think the yields keep rising because it just rates keep rising. Spreads as well, yes. And I think the difference between sale like high yield and investment grade corporates. And by the way, we think high yield is very rich to investment grade right now. Both fundamentally are at a situation where they have very low leverage, high interest coverage. But as the Fed raises rates and you have this borrowing cost that's going to stay higher for a long period of time, particularly during a period next year when growth will be slowing, you really have to assess which sector you want to be in and where you're being compensated for that potential pocket of vulnerability. And we do think that IG given the fact that it's widened out a bit because it's seen much more supply, often as much more value than high yields here. So right now, are you basically really going into longer term treasuries and some of the higher quality investment grade names and just locking it in and saying if we can get 6% yields, which is what you're getting on average in the investment grade space. Well, how all of you let's hang on here for the next three years and we're going to look great. Well, I think what you just said is very important the next three years. And I think you have to look at value versus timing. And look, as we know, this is not the most liquid market and there's a tremendous amount of volatility. And we are getting incrementally longer, meaning we're adding a bit of interest rate risk incrementally, but we are in the fourth quarter. We do believe six months from now, yields are becoming down and that the opportunities we're seeing today, particularly on the yield and rate side, will actually be a tail-in to performance next year. But in the short term, we're going to have some volatility. But the yields that we're seeing here in both whether it's investment grade corporates for agency mortgage backed securities and the spreads. We haven't seen them in probably about 10 years. We're just talking about the US here. What about the United Kingdom? Are you buying that dip? Well, I mean, the UK is a little bit in our opinion. I think a little bit too volatile. I mean, I think there's a lot still happening in terms of the UK, in terms of a falling knife that you might not want to step in front of. There's a lot of issues that may have been resolved, but we do think they're going to be a bit more of contagion in terms of the potential recession in Europe and the volatility there is a bit too high. Well, say I want to back up and just look at the carnage that's out there for many clients and not just UBS Global Wealth Management has been a group effort to see price down and yield up. How do your clients who have a 10 percent, 15 dare I say, 18 percent loss in fixed income? How do they respond to the idea of reallocation and making a new go of it? Well, I mean, look, if there's no question, the performance in fixed income, the double digit negative toll returns have been very visibly displeasing. But the purpose of fixed income is income. And he finally have a wider opportunity set that we haven't seen in years to compound that income going forward. I mean, particularly if you're an investor that holds to maturity or getting prices that are well at a discount, you'll move up to that par level and earn that income out of total return. And it's still an important part of a portfolio, particularly as a diversifier. But again, I mean, when we think about the magnitude of rates that we've seen in 2022, we don't expect to see the same magnitude in 2023. I see, Falkone, thank you so much with UBS this morning. Lisa, I want to go to your wheelhouse here and it's on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5256,2022-10-21 11:40:49
16851," we've seen in 2022. We don't expect to see the same magnitude in 2023. Let's see, Falkone, thank you so much with UBS this morning. Lisa, I want to go to your wheelhouse here and it's on this idea that High Yield maybe hasn't deteriorated like the others. And folks, you can see these in fabulous indices at Bloomberg. This is, of course, all the legacy of Lehman and Barclay. Now with Bloomberg, our total return indices are really informative, particularly when you look across a set of them. And the High Yield one hasn't moved like the other ones. So when I say to you, Lisa, the zombie roll up, which is easy in equities, what does a zombie roll up look like in distress debt? It's unclear because, and this is actually a debate I've been going back and forth with with a number of different investors. Why has High Yield remained so intact given the pain that we've seen in investment grade debt? And there's an argument, well, it's less rate sensitive, but it's also on the spread side. And then people say, well, they're better capitalized, they're better rated, and they have longer maturities. And oh, yeah, the oil sector is doing great. And the energy sector is a significant portion of it. So that's the other argument. But then you have all the people who flood in just like Leslie, a felconio just said and said, they're just getting it wrong. Right. And so then that leads to the question of, well, then what does this credit cycle look like? If you don't have a Fed that's going to come to the rescue, and if you do see yields, baseline rates go to 5%. And this is your point, Tom. This is a good point. And stay there for a longer period of time. I mean, I just brought up, you can do this folks in the Bloomberg. I'm like the worst person in the building on this. But I'm enjoying the snap five year, four year out, six years out convertible bond. And I'm enjoying that Lisa from 100 down to 69 and it's down 30%. Yeah, I mean, it's been dramatic. But I mean, people don't talk enough about the price decline in some of these single bond securities. Although you could argue with even with that huge price decline, we haven't seen the forced selling. So you haven't seen the really dramatic dislocations that would either cause the Fed to come in or would cause people to be able to buy a truly on a discount fire sale. So, you know, is this really as bad as it gets, right? And this is what some people say. No, no, no, no, as bad as it gets is a 98 year Austrian bond feral got me into.

16852," Music I'm going to be an employee. Most somebody is watching and says, I want to be an area man when I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well, it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to be, you've got to show up and you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. You just, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god I'm so tired I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line to success at kind of all over the place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. When US inflation numbers are released, the score is inflation one fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. CorsiPion America 40 year high yields are absolutely flying. It carries down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? We are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go a hundred basis points? The downshift just keeps getting pushed down. Now it looks like we're going into extra innate. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Let's watch and see what happens. surprises. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, high for water rises and the mountains shake. All our will remain, we will never know. We will never know. What you saw of Trust Do, very much linked to what Porta hinted, was to essentially try and blow up the markets. I mean there was no possible way of having these enormous unfunded policies.

16853," The professor from Dartmouth, David Blanchflower, with his not once but twice yesterday, and we really thank him for his perspective here on his bank of England and of course on the political uncertainties in London. Right now, four or five moveable feasts, and we had to look at two or three and push them aside by a single headline from the White House. This is according to Bloomberg News. White House not aware of national security review for musk ventures. And Lisa, this has to be Twitter and I guess we'll have more on that coming up here. Yeah, and we are seeing the shares pulled back from some of the earlier declines down only three and a half percent. I will just note this that our own Jennifer Jacobs had tweeted the story out and somebody responded. It would be hysterical if the government stopped Elon from overpaying for Twitter and then Elon Musk responded to that saying 100% with a laughing crying emoji. So that was, you know, this tactical his technical response to that. The distant view is priced a sales its ugly also is sterling. It was a week or sterling through the two month of the morning. It is rebounded in the last one hour and suddenly his calum pickering was wired up Lisa. Sterling's rolling over. We're not through 111 yet. We'll have a headline on that when we see it. Meanwhile, the earnings very much bleeding into the forward economic view. American Express just recently coming out missing and saying that they built more for charge offs, more provisions and increase the increase their expected charge off rate going forward. Calum Pickering joining us in your economist at Bloomberg. Given how quickly things are moving. How much are markets getting ahead of themselves with respect to how high rates this market can handle this economy can handle and how much is the risk of this inflationary push really is. That's a good question. I am actually wondering at the moment whether the bond market and the equity market are worried about different risks and these risks and mutually exclusive. So the equity market is now starting to panic about the squeezing earnings and the loss of pricing power week. It demand the bond market still seems to be telling us that we've got more inflation and interest rate risk to worry about those and mutually exclusive events. We get the loss of pricing power and we don't have to worry about inflation into next year. And so I think it's more likely that the equity market is actually calling this right than the bond market in which case. We should be anticipating when central banks pivot quite soon. All right. So this comes at a time when the bond vigilantes are back in force and from London there at Bunt Brandberg, you have a good view into that and just how violent that response can be. So the central banks afford to pivot given how jumpy bond markets are whether or not they're right. I think that's a really interesting way to look at this because it probably means central banks cognizant of this and don't want to go through the UK experience where all of a sudden bond markets really start to panic and throw up rates by, you know, multiple tens of a percentage point over the course of the day. You don't want that situation to happen. And so as a central bank, you may be inclined actually to go a little bit further than you need to. You might need clear evidence of disinflation that you're in recession, which probably means I think Europe, we're getting there quite soon. US probably needs to run into next year. Bloomberg has just a fabulous team with Mickey Levy in America and Holger Schmeeting with his brilliant continental view. Let me take you in the United Kingdom is the surprise forward, not from the Fed, but a blink from the ECB that has a war going on. The ECB doesn't have the same inflation problem to deal with that the US has the US has a strong demand, underpinning the prices are rising and they're broad based in Europe, it's mainly this energy supply issue to the extent that Europe is in recession now, we're seeing evidence of weaker demand. Really, the ECB just needs to keep raising interest rates until inflation peaks once that happens and they start to see those base effects roll over, you can start to take out some of the fear and you can hold rates. So I think we're probably quite close. I don't think we get close to 3% in the Eurozone. That would be more than enough, whereas the Fed probably is to go substantially above that. The focus on politics here, and certainly the zeitgeist yesterday was the separation of economics and politics in your United Kingdom. I don't buy it for a minute. How does Governor Bailey risk?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5259,2022-10-21 11:53:45
16854," politics in your United Kingdom. I don't buy it for a minute. How does Governor Bailey respond to a nation staggering to 2 p.m. Monday afternoon? Well, at the moment, there's nothing for the Bank of England to do. We had the announcement earlier this week that active QT would begin towards the end of this year. The next Bank of England meeting to focus on is the third of November. By that time, the Bank of England will know who the Prime Minister is and what kind of fiscal policies the UK will be pursuing over the medium term. The problem the Bank of England has got after what we've seen all of the noise, the bond market reaction, it probably needs to meet market expectations in the next meeting. 100 basis points is probably what we get, which will be a doubling of the rate high in September. But I think after that, maybe 50 more basis points in December and the Bank of England's probably going to be done. But early next year, it's going to be so obvious that the UK is in a recession and it's disinflation. And there's that you won't need to go any further. So the Baronberg calling Sterling right now as we near a 110 handle once again. Where are we in Sterling with that scenario? That scenario, we're probably moving sideways on Sterling, but it's going to be volatile around the politics. You might see a bit of a relief rally, if say, Rishi Sunak, he's the market favorite when's when's becomes Prime Minister. But the world is really suffering from a strong dollar and understandably so we have a major war in Europe, West is in recession. We want deep liquid US markets. So you hold dollar asset. It's hard to see until the market turns more risk on that dollar strength starts to come out. And so we're all going to be weak against the dollar for a while. That probably is a story for next year before we start to see this position reverse. I'm afraid at Kaelin Pickering, thank you so much with Baronberg. Thank you for reading over the weekend. I look at this Lisa. And as I mentioned earlier, I started with John Bern Murdock in the FT on really questioning as is Tim Colpin at Bloomberg, how you measure GDP in China and he cites a University of Chicago paper that it could be half as much growth is we're actually seeing. So I've got a scenario out to think about over the weekend of the finally wake up to the anti-science of COVID and pushing against that is all the challenges of a Pacific rim slowdown, which way do you go? I have one idea. And that feeds into the idea that we were just hearing there from Kaelin Pickering, which is that dollar strength will persist. And this is the opposite of what we heard from Sebastian Galey and Mark Chandler because the rest of the world is on its back. And what does that hurt more the Chinese slowdown that hurts more Europe, that hurts more Germany? So then where does that strength come from that forces the dollar into a weaker position anytime soon that eases some of the inflationary imports of the European region beyond? Well, it's very emotional here. For those of you in radio, there has been imagery over the last number of hours and indeed days as well. And I think Lizzie Birdon, of course, reporting from 10 Downing Street yesterday captured this image. For those of you in radio, it's Lawrence, the cat at the podium outside 10 Downing Street, getting it done. And some humor here, you mentioned this yesterday, Lisa. The gallows humor is tangible. And of course, we missed the walk of the cat back to the door. But yeah, well, yeah, someone also pointed out they put an Airbnb sign above 10 Downing Street. That was another meme that was going around. There have been a lot of them when they tried to you know, understand exactly how quickly this story was. We will try to keep the reporting more than distant from Lawrence or cat. We can do that at Bloomberg.com, UK, a terrific summary of all going on in London.

We are ready to get to know each other. Then we go home. We need to remember we are working together for rest of the two watches on Thursday. We're thinking if we can get a break and this is n to come from deaf communities. Clearly sure we all got coaches but we can't copy. If you could, it'd be deadly nonsense. You'll be there yeah. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. Well, we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in, to work with us, to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform. Probabilities are, they're not all non-securities. Now there's another issue that's as arisen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use message of amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg guys. What does it mean?

She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. We're going to find that this is going to be an even tougher environment than people think. The liquidity of the market remains good. Markets are starting to price in the idea that whatever you turn is going to happen. Nobody is guaranteed that there will be a new turn around the corner a week from now. The reality is that hard activity they took are still pretty strong. What we're saying about 2023 is we think the first half is going to be really sloppy. That's when we think numbers come down. That's when we think we're going to be dealing with recession. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. When does something break? Welcome back. This is Bloomberg surveillance on Bloomberg Radio and Bloomberg Television. Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. John is off running for Prime Minister in London.

16856," It really is hard to keep track of guilt higher, dollar stronger, the rest of the world, flat on its back. And you've said the smartest quote into the weekend reading, which is this fear of the break because what hasn't happened is we haven't broken. These reaction functions, we're gonna talk about this with Alicia Levine, but I'm sorry, Lisa, there's enough movable parts on a Friday. We have to lean in to try to get to the Asia Monday morning. Yen, 152 rounded up is all you need to know. I'm glad that you pointed to the Yen. When does something break really paints a picture for Japan right now? I really this morning, people were saying, when did they come in? When did they intervene? They have intervened before. They're not intervening. When 152 was level, or 151 were above that and it's still not really coming. I turned away to talk to Alicia Levine about the scam known as the SAT exams and 10 year real yield moved to a 1.80, just why I looked away. But that's my point. This is moving quickly, even after all of the increase that we have seen in yield, even after all the reset, even after markets price any 5% fed funds rate for the first half of next year. How much more can we possibly do? I think it's a movable, you know, we got the British distraction here right now, but away from that, and you and I have been remiss on this, the data on the Bloomberg screen has really been the story of the week. Can I just mention that the Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index has gone against Chairman Powell and has moved from significantly restrictive up to a gross accommodation. And again, 1.80 10 year real yield that changes the discussion for global wealth. Well, and this goes to the point that we would be hearing about from Mike Wilson over at Morgan Stanley. He said that expect a bear market rally because expectations are so low, earnings will come in and they'll be better than expected because that's what they do. They guide people lower and then they beat those very low bars and that's what we've seen with some companies. It hasn't been enough and that to me is a pretty big takeaway with American Express, one of the bell weather types of companies coming in short as well as the shipping sector. Yeah, I'm going to mention that I'm much more interested in Verizon, which has been a challenge for over 10 years and they're talking about cost cutting of some form. I guess we're going to see a lot more of that into the end of the year. We are seeing weakness and we're seeing the weakness deep in as we see yield. There we go. There's some ramble gloomy. Well, come on, let's take a look at what's going on. We're down six cents of a percent on the S&P and it has been heading lower throughout the morning at one point, it was really trying to stay flat. You are seeing the euro continue to weaken. This is a dollar strength story and that's me. I think it's pretty pervasive across the world with the pound with the euro with the yen, 9747, and 10-year yields. I mean, honestly, to see just on the cusp, a 4.3 percent, could we see four and a half percent by the next couple of weeks? I'm going to, I'm looking at the real yield and not the nominal story and it's completely changed. So how do you write your year end essay right now? I have no idea. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Go to cash, go to cash. Triple of junk cash. I think that's a title of Alicia Levine's. Well, Alicia Levine actually joins us here without the star destroyer behind her. Alicia Levine, head of equities in capital market advisory of BNY, Melon wealth management. What is your view, Alicia? And how you view this move upwards in yield? Are we watching something break in slow motion? So I don't think we're watching anything break, but we shouldn't be surprised at this because that last CPI print really said it all. Cornflation is now higher today than it was in 1982. Forget the top line, it's the core. And that's ultimately what central banks are looking at and what the Fed is looking at. And that's our problem. What's amazing to me is that Ratchup in yields this week, the equity market kind of shrugged it off. You would have thought there would have been a more dramatic reaction there. So I think we get something in the next few days to reflect what's happened with yields and with rates ratcheting up higher. You are hugely adept at the mathematics of the moment. I want you to correlate the bond dynamics we're all talking about over to how you reset for equities into next year. Can you link the two beasts together or are they non-correlated? So I think you have to link the two together because in this year, equities were really the caboose and the bond market was driving the train here, which I get teased about. No, but we're not. We're not talking about the bond market, but it is true because your multiples get compressed when yields and rates move higher. What the market is doing is pricing in an over 5% Fed funds",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5262,2022-10-21 12:06:51
16857," market, but it is true because your multiples get compressed when yields and rates move higher. What the market is doing is pricing in an over 5% Fed funds rate. You're going to feel it on the equity side. You can't avoid that. It's all one system. You don't have assets that just trade on their own. It's against the risk rate. Right. But in a loguclidean space, or even if you go to some fancy XYZ space as well, is it nonlinear from here in the dynamics of the bond market pushing stocks around? So that's a really interesting question. You're asking, has the work been done? Right. You're asking, have we had enough multiple compression? And I think the answer is the direction is still an evolved hell way. But I do think a lot of the multiple compression has already been taken care of because if you think we're headed into recession the first half of the year, you're going to wind up with lower yields eventually. And that in a weird way is going to support the market. Also the earning season is coming in. Lisa, as you pointed out, better than expected. In part because of inflation. In part because we had the financials report. And so they're doing well on net interest margin. And you know, the high end consumer is spending. Think about Nordstroms. Think about LVMH and travel. So people are out there spending. It's not a total collapse yet. So you could have some stabilization as you have to your yields move higher. So what happens first, the Fed blinking or seeing yields kind of get out of control and cause some sort of torpedo effect in the multiple valuations? So I don't think the Fed blinks. Okay. The Fed will blink if there's an event. And right now the UK walked back from their events, which walked back the event on the global bond market. And they seem very intense on getting higher here. And they've really trapped themselves, right? They've trapped themselves because they keep on talking about CPI, which as you know, is backward looking because they want to signal to the average household that the Fed is on the inflation job. Backward looking. We still haven't seen the effects of the rate hiking cycle for another six months. So you know, you have signs, housings rolling over. You have signs of a slow down, but the Fed's out there hiking with old data. Meanwhile, taking a look at what we're expecting from earnings, we get some of the big tech names next week. We have seen snap. That was concerning. And it's been very concerning this morning for owners of meta, which already has tanked. I mean, Facebook has lost a significant portion of its value. How much more do the tech bubbles have to burst at a time when they've already been devalued dramatically? So high growth names when they stop growing high growthly get not only an earnings, but they get the multiple compression as well. So to the extent that you have stocks that are still trading at 40 times next year's, the tech names are still too high. And ultimately, those names have not been driven down dramatically. I'm going to slip this in. If there's a factor adjustment into 2023, and I'm really big on the zombies are going to be taken out in this new rate regime, what do the non zombies do in which factors matter next year for the profitable non zombies? So there will be a wave of M&A coming from the non zombies and cheap, right? You're going to have really fire sale of companies here for IP as well. I mean, you could have M&A just for IP in some of these sectors. But ultimately to the extent that companies raised cash during the time of near zero rates, you should have some resiliency there. I think the credit cycle happens in the private markets and those middle markets where they couldn't quite raise the cash because the corporate America is flush with cash right now. The refinancing there is not going to be the problem. And ultimately, the American consumer, you know, I was looking at the unemployment data yesterday, the new claims data. I mean, we're at rock bottom. There is not a problem in the labor market here. So you have this weird push pole where you're getting the bullet effect on inventories. And you've got labor working and spending. Yeah. Alicia Levine, too short. Thank you so much for being with us. Alicia Levine of BNY Malin Wealth Management. That is the one and the most fascinating points, Tom. I see a investors appear. But it was, and I said, maybe you haven't.

16858," And spending. Yeah. Alicia Levine, too short. Thank you so much for being with us. Alicia Levine of BNY Malin Wealth Management. That is one of the most fascinating points, Tom. This idea of the private markets being where the big reset comes. And we heard from Harvard's endowments. And they actually said that they outperformed what they actually expected done in retrospect because they haven't yet seen the big markdowns in the private markets from some of their managers. I like what we heard earlier this week where we go back to alpha, where individual security selection, bond and stock really begins to matter. I can't emphasize enough the percentage of people out there that have never lived a sharp ratio, a legitimate risk-free rate into the risk reward calculation. Who have lived by indexes, who have lived by blanket buying, they've lived by the right disinflation that's gone. And so now what happens when you get a credit cycle in assets that you actually have to look at, right? I mean, that's why we were just here in Malaysia. And I thought this was interesting. Apollo and JP Morgan are working on building out secondary trading of private credit because they're anticipating the same kind of thing. And there's been some reporting on that because they expect that to be. They're going to trade Bitcoin. Well, I mean, I guess. What I would say is in the 8 o'clock hour and a Friday, we have Alicia Levine over to Steve Major of HSBC and that's what the show is all about. Absolutely. Steve Major has been really out front. He's going to have a pretty controversial call. I don't think he sees up and away for yields the same way that perhaps Larry summits. Oh, no. It could be fascinating. Plus, he's got to talk about Aston Villa and Steve Gerard out the door. Well, I will let you spearhead the hospital. I love the monologue on that because where the hell is Pharaoh, right? You're going to have a monologue on that coming up. Hopefully, without just too many monologues, Steve and Major, global head of fixed income research at HSBC. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world. With the first word, I'm Kreeti Gupta. Biden administration officials are said to be discussing whether the US should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews. Sources say that would include the Twitter deal and SpaceX's Starlink network. US officials are uncomfortable with what they see as Musk's increasingly Russia friendly stance and is planned to buy Twitter with foreign investors. Ukraine's foreign minister says he talked with Israel's Prime Minister about Kiev's request for defense systems to help combat Russian missiles and Iranian-made drones. Israel has offered to assist Ukraine with a missile warning system, but says it will not provide weapons. The US has accused Tehran of sending trainers and technicians to Crimea to support Russian drone attacks. Air can express has slumped after it's set aside more for bad loans than analysts expected. It suggests rising interest rates could start hammering customers' abilities to pay their bills. Provision for souring loans were $778 million in the quarter, worse than the $573 million analysts in a Bloomberg survey were expecting. The European Union has agreed to press ahead with a set of emergency actions to address the bloc's energy crisis. It comes after Germany yielded to pressure from other member states to pave the way for a temporary price cap on natural gas. The European Council's president says the move sends a clear signal to the market that the bloc is ready to act together. And Credit Suisse will aim to settle a tax fraud and money laundering case in France on Monday. The Swiss lender is reportedly in the final stretch of negotiations with prosecutors to reach an agreement that would include a fine but no admission of guilt.

I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels, it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building, that's a statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can get a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level, it's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them.

It's also the yeah it's absolutely global and I got a stagger back to one statistic here before we get to Twitter 1.81% on the US 10 year real yield that is moving that is almost to the phrase leaping logarithmically up and from a 1.61 to a 180 maybe that's the one statistic that helps. Talking about how quickly yields are moving on the flip side of the dollar the dollar and the real yields the nominal yields for 10 basis points 10% for the 10 year treasury at what point do we end up with something that really is a game changer in terms of longer term expectation. Keep your breath to this and of course looking in the foreign exchanges the deepest part of the market the deepest part of Elon Musk market is well maybe it's not going to work a number of items out this morning saying you may have another cash call to finally get this transaction done Edward Lutlow joins us right now expert on all this I think there's four musk stories this morning which one matters for his ability to get this transaction. Yeah the Bloomberg report that DCs antagonized by him. This is about by national. Yeah so Bloomberg reported that according to sources you know his recent behavior and commentary around the war in Ukraine about his. Brief threats to remove the star link connectivity services that he was providing to help the efforts in Ukraine and also just simply the deal to buy Twitter. Our sources tell us that across a range of government agencies they're thinking we better we might take a look at this now by the way public service announcement. The White House has this morning said that it's not aware of any review of Elon Musk security clearance or any security review of his businesses. But clearly they're thinking about it you know this isn't the first time it's happened 2019 he goes on the Rogan podcast smokes marijuana he also leads the biggest private space. Come on come on you're not going to equate marijuana with the guy who builds technology which helps Ukraine in battle. Not all I'm saying is that this discussion around Elon Musk's behavior and his security clearances remember SpaceX provides services not just an asset but to the military in the Pentagon. But also he's a big contractor right and they simply said this is not the behavior forthcoming or fitting for somebody who had. Who has this low security clearance the bigger issue around the deal is this ironically. We'd reported things going pretty well bankers on both sides working the banks getting ready for the debt called to come in right. And then this comes out and it throws the deal into doubt and you see that reflected in the market. This is a distraction let's be honest because Twitter has been an ongoing distraction a story onto itself with the Elon Musk kind of. But masks the real story even at Twitter which is that they were planning cuts at the company even before he got involved that this was a company that was really struggling. And you're seeing that not just with Twitter but the social media facing tech companies more broadly as we saw from to snap. I mean how much have we seen the reset already take its course versus have more to go back to what Jim Bianco just said. Exactly. The shock is greater than we expected. Actually we thought the softness in the advertising market was done with after the war in Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5266,2022-10-21 12:24:09
16861," Jim Bianco just said on the program, the shock is greater than we expected. Actually, we thought the softness in the advertising market was done with. You know, after the war in Ukraine and in Europe in particular, we had the commentary from Alphabet, parent of Google, we had the commentary from Snap actually already. Yeah. But the wording in there, their earning statement was so specific, a pull back in spending by advertisers. They're decreasing budgets and all of these names are fighting for a small pool. Why is it important? It's actually a pretty good lens into the macro picture. Advertises pull back their spending because consumers aren't spending why they hurt by inflation. People are probably not interested as much in tech right now because they're looking at markets and they see a whole lot of second and they see yields moving dramatically. But this is part and parcel of potentially a similar story. The free money is over and tech is going to be reeling and that is what we're seeing right now play out. My eyes didn't light up just because I'm interested in tech. I'm trying to justify my existence. But you know, I take city for example, they have this call where they're overweight, gobble tech. Why look at the specific names, the one with the strong balance sheets with the entrenched market positions. When you're trying to work out what's doing in an earnings season and where earnings on an EPS basis will hold up better than other corners of the market, there is a thinking that actually, yeah, of course, Apple's going to fare better here. They're more nimble. They've got the cash to flex. They're smart about how they handle the economy globally. So there is some optimism out there around global tech being a better play. Almost like a defensive stock. Yeah. Do you buy that theory? I don't know, but there is some corner of the market that believes that. Well, perhaps find out and let low. Thank you so much of Bloomberg will find out perhaps on Thursday with the earnings right now. Stocks and bonds very much on the move yields higher. And the dollar really preeminent, Tom, around. Yeah. Well, when Bruce Galber, I tweet, said, and says time, give me a DX. Why quote? I don't have my Bloomberg. We're in the Bruce Good morning to you. DX Y 113.86 out to 114. 115 is an unimaginable print. And I'm going to go right back to the IMF meeting where on camera and off camera, it was the same thing. They're watching swap lines, which is the borrowing of overnight money, think Friday, between major countries, including Switzerland. It's confusing. It's advanced. And critically, the nations that do not have available, the ability to go out and borrow the millions of dollars overnight that don't have swap lines. And I'm going to say that these are the shadows cast right now by the rumors, the speculation Lisa about the unknown of swap line discussions of the IMF and all the major central banks. You're suggesting that there's some sort of backroom negotiation. There's no going on. No, I'm not saying backroom. I'm saying I'm looking at the Bloomberg screen on a Friday, and it's given me all sorts of information that there's something going on out there. I don't know what it is. I think that there is something going on. There is yields higher and there is the dollar. Marketly stronger and even more so as the moment goes on. And I do have to keep coming back to the end. We had expected an intervention. It has not come yet, at least to the satisfaction of markets, with a pervasive weakening in the currency as they stick by the World Cup. Their goal is control there and the way you get control is Saturday, Sunday, into their morning stay with Asia and Bloomberg radio and TV here on Sunday. And Stephen Major, he's coming up. Cannot wait for that discussion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5267,2022-10-21 12:28:32
16862," Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this is a portfolio that I'm related to while learning folks are growing up. You should not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers. Infrared sonnas and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now it's completely innovating the way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a morade. When US inflation numbers are released. The score is inflation one fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. Corsi Pion America 40 year high yields are absolutely flying. It's down and down hot. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup of this inflation? She are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go a hundred basis points? The down shift just keeps getting pushed down. Now it looks like we're going into extra innards. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg, your global business authority. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg surveillance on Bloomberg television and Bloomberg radio Tom Keane and Lisa Abram was John Farrell is not really running for Prime Minister. He is off. We are seeing markets on the move stocks lower at session lows down 7. 10% on the S&P down 8. 10% now on the S&P euro 97 14 weaker versus the dollar yields really are to me the driving force. Yes, it is a dollar story, but it is also very much a yield story with 10 year yields at 4.32% real yields crossing that 1.8% level Tom to me. This is a market that is facing some sort of reckoning. Have people gotten over their skis without high yields can go? What surveillance is about is you get lucky and we got lucky yesterday with terrific work, particularly with David Merritt, who let all of our Brexit coverage ages ago. And Lisa, I thought it was just great yesterday. Have everybody Michael Sway and the rest of them weigh in on the absolute chaos there. You think we got lucky this morning? Without a doubt with bondage, the land days in the front seat, huh? Getting himself back from Hong Kong, Stephen Major joins us now with HSBC, global head of fixed income research and we're thrilled he could join Bloomberg in our New York studios. Forget about all the market talk here. What is the experience of living in Hong Kong under quarantine? It's getting easier Tom, much easier and I can't wait to go back because we're free now. There is no quarantine. So I've done my time now. You think they can salvage their relationship? I don't want to get you in trouble.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5268,2022-10-21 12:32:48
16863," Wait to go back because we're free now. There is no quarantine. So I've done my time now. You think they can salvage their relationship? I don't want to get in trouble. They just be management. But you are optimistic they can salvage their relationship with Western banks to stay a financial capital. Yeah, I think all the moves are in place. And November's a big month. Many people are going this. Yes. We're thrilled to join us for this entire half hour. You are known as someone that has said price up and yield will stay down. We've seen a major adjustment here. What is the new major look and how yield finally crawls lower in price higher? When do we get there? How do we get there? Don't you have a show called Real Yield? We do. Is that one of John's ones? Yeah. I've been letting this after. You're doing it. Well, at least it's relevant now. Because you actually do have a real yield. No, it's relevant because Lease is doing it. John's out doing it. Actually, yeah. Let's have fun at John's expense. I'm going to be 24, 7. Continue, Mr. Major. But if you can get real yield anywhere near 2%, that covers real GDP. So if you're building a portfolio from scratch, and this is without being encumbered by all of the carnage in markets the last few months, if you're building from scratch, 2% real yield covers GDP in the longer run. So we don't know where inflation is. It seems to be a good place to start building a portfolio with a real yield close to 2%. So let's just put this into something that's very clear. Do you see 10-year yields at 4.3% in the US as a screaming buy load up because we are not going to see yields like this again? Yeah, well, fortunately, I work with some professionals who contain my enthusiasm. Because I would have been buying every week. That's why I'm not a trader. But the point is the valuations today show a very strong, recent seat bias. I can honestly believe that yields will keep going up in the near term. But you could also build a plausible scenario that there's a hard landing and that yields should be less than 2%. You could build that scenario. The question is, what weighting do you put on it? So at the moment, we're pricing a very high probability of the Fed going to five and staying there forever, which doesn't seem plausible. Well, a lot of people, and this is something that I was really excited that you were coming on to push against what I'm hearing increasingly is that there is a stickier, more pervasive inflation over the long term. Yeah. And that the Fed funds rate is not going to go below 2% any time in the next decade, simply because of the de-globalization or the localized globalization, some of the population trends and some of these other macro factors. I don't think the longer term picture has changed, Lisa, demographics, debt, wealth inequality, that the explanations for low-arzt are have not reversed. I think you can give me some arguments that may be under right or underpin the arse, but not reverse it. I don't think you can reverse the pre-pandemic trend. Just to quickly follow on to this, then do you think we're going to see 0% rates in the next five years? I think you'll get a hard landing and the probability of the market pricing a return to the zero bound cannot be ignored. So it's all about probabilities. The market's surprising rates at five. So the two-year yield can be 100 to 150 over the current money rate. In an easing cycle, the two-year can be 150 through the money rate. So that's not happening this week, but sometime next year at the market would not be wrong to be pricing in an easing cycle. I got a ceiling angle here. If you're on radio, Stephen Major, where this would be just BC for this entire half hour. And the one angle I want to talk about, as you mentioned, the breakage that could be there and what we're observing right now in the markets, DXY, getting up near 114 is without question the focus that the IMF was on swap lines. Is it enough of a power in the foreign exchange market to see dollar strong where there's a swap line demand or a desire for swap lines, even if I can't get them? Is that enough to make your own power blink? There are a number of economies in Asia where there's been a tightness in the funding markets recently. And looking ahead to year end kind of places. Yeah, we had a fire drill with the UK, which shows what lessons did we get from the UK? Fast moves are dangerous. It isn't just the level, it's the speed, right? So I wouldn't be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5269,2022-10-21 12:37:10

16866," So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great, but I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. That's the order is going to look like how much work on a pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers. These completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We have 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. I would not be surprised how fragile financial markets are. The Fed has to pause to get them back under control. The US financial markets are in a good place right now. But if nothing else, the UK has shown us how fragile to an event, to a bad policy decision. So I don't feel confident about what they are going to do in December. Let alone where we are going to be by June of next year. She is a former Fed economist that barely describes the academic contributions of Claudia Som. She is controversial with us today on the Fed. And she has her own ratio, if you will, to some measurement of recession, which you can see throughout all the Fed systems. She has had quite a splash academically and then linking it over to all the punditry that we see each and every day. We welcome you to Bloomberg's surveillance on radio and television. And what a joy. Some quiet moments here with Stephen Major of HSBC in a very unquiet time. My study in this goes back to Martin Feldstein of Harvard is that these things end stochastically. These move and they don't level, they don't plateau, they get pointy, they turn around.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5272,2022-10-21 12:50:09
16867," Harvard is at these things and stochastically. Things move and they don't level, they don't plateau, they get pointy, they turn around in reverse. What is a stochastic event that will allow some of the carnage I see on my screen to reverse? That's right Tom, I think that it might even be a bi-modal market. So you've got one mode that's got this strong recency bias and then there's the other one that prices in an event. I mean the facts are that the median number of months between the last hike and the first cut based on the last 70 years of data, guess what, four months. The mean is eight, so it's skewed because of the 2006, 2008 period. But my point is you just look at the numbers. Once they've hit the peak, the market is not wrong to be looking over the other side. And what's the event? Well, the UK could have been. If the UK event of fast moving yields and disruption, somehow infected, affected the US financial markets. I'm talking here about money markets or mortgage markets or you said swap lines, all this stuff. Who knows? That makes the Fed think twice about going all the way to find or about. You're living Hong Kong, you're living the anti-science of China, fine. The anti-science of monetary policy is Japan. Everyone knows this. What are the ramifications to the Steve Major world when they capitulate on YCC in some face-saving form and you get 152 to 129 over a little a cup of coffee? Yeah. What happens to the system? I don't think you get the shock that you could have had if they changed YCC a year ago. Because of where US yields sit today, they're so far above. So they can soak up easily a Japanese move. I imagine that the Japanese curve would flatten. So it would be a bare flattening because the curve is so steep between 10 and 30 years. Now, in global fixed income, that's not gone unnoticed. If you're sitting in Germany, you can switch from your local market into JGBs and pick up yield because of the curve's evenness and the hedging. Because Japanese rates are below zero at the front end, whereas ECB and Fed are hiking. So there are opportunities here in global fixed income from the diversions. To go to your arch thesis is they manufacture, I'm going to to toralize here in Faisuto inflation. Are we essentially going to have a stochastic move back to disinflationary trends in the arch-major theory, which is some forms of deflation? I think so. And from a Japanese perspective, if you've waited 30 years to come out of deflation, a couple of months of plus two, plus three, doesn't do it. And that's the corroded approach. We don't know who corroded this replacement's going to be. He or she won't be in place until next year. So it's just speculation on our part. And I feel very much that's all we're doing. Right. We're trying to game it out anyway. And now folks, we dive into our World Cup coverage. We do this without John Fair, which is unfortunate. You of course have a global mandate. You're going to be in the Middle East. I guess you're going to attend the World Cup. Can you explain to me, Mordals like me, how we see a good product with 86 degrees on the field? It might be a slow game. It could be completely different. I mean, I'm going to go and see some England games. I'm lucky enough to get tickets. But I think it's going to be a strange World Cup. It's going to be surreal. Because in that kind of heat, it will be a lot cooler than it is in the summer, obviously. But the game's going to be slower and I guess more measured. It's not going to be as crazy as the premiership. Because you've seen how fast they play in the premiership. We've seen it yourself, man. I'm Sterling and Gilts. Let's finish it. I've got a 110.84. We've moved a full stick here on Sterling this morning, 112 down to 110.87. It's inappropriate for you to comment on the politics, but please, on the pressures that Governor Bailey faces. Well, he's reiterated the independence. And I think he's been pushed into a bit of a corner. I mean, it didn't help that the Bank of England was hiking a pace less than the Fed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5273,2022-10-21 12:54:37

16869," be intellectually curious. You gotta be, you gotta show up. And you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. You just, yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't want to do this. You gotta show up. You gotta be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place. And you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. Hey, so you've gotta explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in insane it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. What thetermirings are on. One of the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg. That is a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the hardest question I get all night. I'll go at YaFab. Bloomberg television, Top Exproduifts, Great questions. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. Because Trussonomics is being dismantled, MPs behind the scenes are asking, what's the point of having her at the top? In the strong dollar, Apple fly the world's risks of instability. She didn't think that complete reunification must be realized. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. From New York City for our viewers worldwide, I'm Lisa Bromwells in for Jonathan Farrow. When does something break? We're not seeing it in the equity markets. They are down, but it is not violent. However, in the bond market, yields climbing to decade highs. The countdown to the open starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Farrow. We've been with the big issues, treasure yields, and just keep on surging. These yields are not all over done, at least not yet. The story of this year has clearly been higher bond yields, the rising bond yields. We're back to a different era, and I think that we will stay here. It really comes down to inflation. We keep going back to inflation data. We're probably going to see persistent inflation. And that keeps yields still a bit on the offsite. U.S. data is not going to provide much leeway for a free-break yield to fall. The underpinnings of the economy here in the U.S. is really quite robust. The reality is that hard activity they are still pretty strong. What that means to me ultimately is that the Fed has to do more to slow down the man's side. The two-year yield always peaks above whatever the terminal rate is. We still got about 75, basically, points more to this kind. For a bond investor, it's all going to be about raises. It is all about yields right now, 4.3% on a 10-year yield in the United States. As we were talking, Gregory Staples of DWS and Stephanie Roth of JPMorgan, we've been talking about could they get up to 3.5% a couple of months ago, even a month ago? And yet here we are, Gregory, what do you make of the move that we're seeing today? You know what I think what's been going on is that the markets really had a sea change in the perception of what the Fed's going to do. If you go back to the summertime, there was real skepticism in the sense that a pivot was going to come fairly soon. And the Fed speakers pushed back against that fairly hard and now the markets embrace the tightening, with an almost evangelical passion. The markets almost ahead of the Fed now pricing in 5%, by the first quarter of next year. And you're seeing that reflected across the curve. And now for the first time, it's really starting to impact the long end. Or close to the end, I don't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5275,2022-10-21 13:04:38
16870," across the curve and now for the first time it's really starting to impact the long end. Are we close to the end? I don't know, but boy, boy, we come a long way in a very short period of song. Stephanie, what's your view here? Especially as we see the pace of the move this morning, we've retraced from some of the highs, but still at the highest levels in the 10-year treasury going back to 2007. Totally agree with Greg in that it was driven initially by the economy holding up better than expected inflation remaining higher. But more recently, the move seems to be less fundamentally driven. It appears to be more about ill-equity. And that could mean that the 10-year could back up even higher than where we are today. But we do think eventually rate should rally and we do think that on the back of recession fears and recession actually playing out in the middle of 2023. Rate should rally. It's just a question of how high does a 10-year get before that happens. Well, and this to me really goes to the question that a lot of people are asking Stephanie. Bank of America's Mark Abana warning of treasury market dysfunction exactly kind of what you're referencing. Right in quote, U.S. Treasury liquidity has deteriorated amid weak demand and investor risk aversion. The market is fragile and vulnerable to shock. A treasury breakdown is not our base case, but it is a building tail risk. It's definitely as you put it. Is it a tail risk or is it actually a tail wind potentially giving to a rally with some sort of, I don't want to say pivot, but a sense that this cannot go on forever. Totally can't go on forever. That said, the Fed is not likely to step in at this point. So this could get worse before it gets better. Eventually, we would expect that the Fed would step in in the event of it becoming dysfunctional, but we're not at a dysfunctional point at this juncture. So it could continue for some time before the markets settle down. Gregory, from your perspective, Stephanie was talking about how it feels very technical in nature. Do you have a sense based on your on the ground view of who is doing the selling, of where this is coming from, why the buyers are not stepping in? I'm not so sure it's the selling. I think it's the removal of the buyers from the marketplace. The three big buyers have really stepped away from the market. Of course, the Fed number one is they've pivoted into QT. That's 95 billion of buying that's disappeared every single month. The banking sector, which was a huge buyer, that it would invest the reserves that the Fed was creating through their QE program, they've pulled away. And you've got a lot of really sort of frozen lungs who have marked a market positions well below a par, and they really can't sell those without realizing some accounting losses. And finally, overseas buyers have stepped away. If you look at, you know, Bank of Japan, Bank of China, etc., they were big tickers down of treasuries, if you will, for an extended period of time, they've pulled back. So I think it's really an erosion of demand rather than it is sellers on the supply side. It's hard to game out the bond market for sure, and a lot of equity analysts are trying to understand what this means for valuations over the long term. If we can't get a sense of whether we do get some sort of violent reversal and yields back down toward something that we've seen that's more familiar over the past few decades. Stephanie, from your perspective, have we seen the re-rating evaluations within the equity space on the heels of some of the yield market move? Or do you think that that has brought to go? There may be some more to go, but we do think with equities trading close to $3,600, that's the time to start stepping in. We'd be buying on that dip. Yeah, it could get worse before it gets better, especially as the market starts to price in the recession, it's likely to happen. But at this point, we would be, we would be adding equities. We'd be buying industrial, we'd be buying technology at reasonable price. We'd be buying healthcare. So now is it's good at times, is it any, both for the 60 and 40 side of your portfolio? All right, we're going to be digging into that in the upcoming hour. We are looking at earnings, if they've been coming out. We are more than 20 percent done. Earning, starting to sour with corporate America, struggling to clear a low bar, at least in certain pockets. Share prices getting punished and disappointing, disappointing results definitely are being making their mark. Right now, let's go to Bloomberg's kitty grifeld from Mark Cady. Well Lisa, you're right. Earning season definitely ramping up and it's not going great. I would say you have hospital stocks under pressure this morning. That's after disappointing results from HCA holdings and from tenant healthcare, tenant down a whopping 22 percent after revenue guidance was narrowed. You also have rural, pool and American express under pressure as well. And this morning's price action fairly and been a little dramatic of this earnings season so far. You have expectations. Like you said, they've been lowered dramatically and companies are still managing to disappoint. You're looking at estimates now versus three months ago. S&P 500 third quarter EPS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5276,2022-10-21 13:07:48
16871," said they've been lowered dramatically and companies are still managing to disappoint. You're looking at estimates now versus three months ago, S&P 500 third quarter EPS growth. It's currently expected at 2.2% for the third quarter. That figure was 6.3% on July 29. It feels like a long time ago. And it's early still, but so far this quarter on track to be the most punishing for companies that miss estimates since at least 2017. That's as far back as our data go. The average one day change for earnings misses is a 3.8% drop, but Lisa, we've got another big week next week. So we'll see how that goes. Katie Greiffel, thank you so much. Chris Harvey of Wells Fargo reshuffling the portfolio in response to some of these earnings, but not necessarily the way you would think you ditched cyclicals and downgraded the big bags. Take a listen. It's more of a macro issue than anything else. And if you look at how banks report and look at the numbers, they popped their performing in line with the market. We thought this was a good time just to step off this trade. Nothing that that we really don't like about the banks, but we do think it's just more of a market perform as we think about things to sentiment or the macro sentiment's going to be an overhang. And we just don't want to fight that. Stephanie Rothen Gregory Staples still with us. Stephanie, from your vantage point, how much is this really the story of this earnings season that people are using, whether stocks rally or whether stocks sell off as just a way to double down on their theses regardless of what the earnings actually showed? Hey, it's actually a function of margins remaining elevated. That sounds like a good thing from a stock perspective, but from a macro standpoint, we don't really want margins to remain high. That's challenging the Fed even more. That means the Fed has to go even higher to get the slowdown in the economy. If margins don't roll over, that won't allow the labor market to cool down. Why would companies start doing layoffs or really pause hiring if the margins remain elevated? So the fact that earnings remain coming pretty decent at this point is not actually a great thing for the long term picture. That means the Fed's going to go higher. And it could result in a larger downturn than what otherwise be the case. And Gregory, this is the reason why there have been such confusing signals right now from the credit markets. We've seen an investment grade. If the sell-off has been really market and much more dire than what we've seen in high yield, even though high yield, arguably more leveraged companies heading into a downturn would have a difficult time. What do you make of that? This resilience in high yield at a time when investment grade is really seeing the biggest losses? I think there's a couple of good reasons. Their first offer, I think a lot of the corporations use the last two years to really pre-fund a lot of the debt on their balance sheet. And they load resiliency from the COVID lockdown, so corporations that think are a lot stronger. They didn't extend themselves in terms of debt. Clearly, a lot of the high yield market is in the energy and raw material space, which is done fairly well overall. We have not seen the kind of widening in terms of spreads that you would see if you're seeing an economy entry recession, whether that be an investment grade or high yield overall. You have to be a little bit concerned if you've got refunding coming up. The refunding markets are not closed, but they're closed too. It's getting harder and harder to get deals done. So I think for the moment, we're just looking at the fourth quarter slowdown if potentially it happens, but as earnings come in in the third quarter, this is not an economy that's in a recession at all. So based on that, Gregor, are you buying the riskier securities, even though they haven't sold off as much, simply because the resilience really has been the story in so many sectors? We're not buying them at all. I think there's probably actually some weakness that's coming ahead. The market hasn't recognized that yet. So we're actually moving up inequality and making it being a little bit more conservative, keeping cash balances shorter maturedities. We think that there's more potential widening to go in the fourth quarter. And right now, we are looking out also at TechRnings, which we're going to be getting into next week. How much Stephanie, and we're going to dig into that more in the upcoming segments, but from your advantage point, how pivotal will that be to sort of set the tone about the re-rating and the fundamentals at a time when you actually see value here? That will be important, but it's not exactly the story for the broad economy. So markets will certainly care, but when I'm thinking about the message for the rest of the economy, Tech has been a bit of a divergent sector from the rest of the economy. It was benefiting from COVID. You're starting to see layoffs there, but that's not indicative of what we're seeing in the broader market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5277,2022-10-21 13:12:07
16872," Tech has been a bit of a divergent sector from the rest of the economy. It was benefiting from COVID. You're starting to see layoffs there, but that's not indicative of what we're seeing in the broader market. So certainly the equity market will be paying attention to it from a macro perspective. I'll be focused on some of the more stickly inclined names. So so far, Stephanie, when you look at the ones that matter, the names that matter for an economic perspective, what do you put on in on? What sort of stands out to you so far in the earnings season? So far, the, you know, the message from the banks have been that the consumers okay. And that's been sort of the trend that we've seen for the bulk of this year. Consumer spending has remained stable, maybe not strong, but it hasn't cracked on the back of of fed hiking. We expect that eventually it will. The housing market is certainly feeling the pain, but it takes time for it to filter into the rest of the economy. And we would expect to hear the message from company earnings certainly from the banks and then looking to hear what the consumer companies are saying. Stephanie, we're all at the Gregory Staples. Both of you are sticking with us. We want to take a look right now at the stocks moving ahead of the opening bell. With that, that is Kayleigh lives Kayleigh. Well, at least the big one this morning is snap. Absolutely brutal plenching the better part of 30% early hours after reporting the worst revenue growth, the slowest revenue growth on record after the belly yesterday. The company blaming it continued slow down in the advertising market because as the economy slows down, apparently a lot of companies don't want to spend as much on ads. So that's taking snap down and a lot of other social media advertising reliant companies down with it. You could argue Twitter falls into that basket, but what's happening there has more to do with Elon Musk today. First you have the Washington Post report yesterday saying that if he doesn't de-succeed and taking over the company, he could cut up to 75% of the workforce, but it's an if he succeeds. Because Bloomberg also reporting that the Biden administration is looking at a potential national security review of Musk's ventures. The White House says it's not aware of that. So we are off of session lows, but still Twitter down about 5% in early hours and Tesla for its part down about 1%. Finally, I threw Spotify on here as well. Lisa, I don't think you're swifty. I would guess not, but Taylor Swift's new album dropped at midnight in case you weren't aware. And at the same time, Spotify was running into a lot of issues with users not being able to access it. So a lot of swiftees may be upset about that, Spotify down about 1.3% before the bell. Kaylee, thank you with the swifty report. Coming up, Liz Tross leaves Downing Street. I am a fighter, a North-Ain't fighter. I am resigning as leader of the conservative party. The turmoil ahead and who takes the helmet next, that conversation is still ahead. From New York, we are seeing equities lower, although actually they have flipped with 15 minutes to go. Basically unchanged here as we head toward that bell. This is Blumpert. Most of us don't spend much time thinking about the grid. The dizzyingly huge system of cables, transformers and outlets that reliably powers our lives. It's an easily ignored, change resistant part of the modern world and that's the way we like it. But as we move towards less planet melting ways of producing electricity, the grid is going to have to evolve too. We are seeing so many countries and governments announcing high targets when it comes to decarbonisation and being climate neutral. But this is just one side of the coin. It's not enough to simply generate green energy, we also need to make sure that this transmitted and distributed to the end consumers. The grid of the day just isn't equipped for renewables, so a new kind of grid is starting to take shape. The super grid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5278,2022-10-21 13:16:24
16873," Take shape. The super grid. Innovation, money, and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chang. Weekdays at 5 p.m. in New York and 2 p.m. in San Francisco. Written in crisis. I'm resigning as leader of the conservative party. The shortest ever serving Prime Minister. Trust Bloomberg for the fastest coverage and instant expert analysis. Here's a general election enough to begin to restore some of the credibility. It takes a long, long time for the markets to forgive you. Now from an economic point of view, Tinkerix. Brexit has not gone away. Wake up car here for the conservative party. For continuing coverage, keep attuned to Bloomberg Television and Radio. I have a bold plan to grow the economy through tax cuts and reform. It was becoming a distraction, so that's why we immediately changed that policy. We will keep an iron grip on the nation's finances. Mr Speaker, I think the last thing we need is a general election. I am a fighter and not a fighter. I recognise, though, given the situation, I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected by the conservative party. I am resigning as leader of the conservative party. A really rough 44 days for Liz Truss, the UK hoping to curb recent turmoil with a new Prime Minister. Markets are reading on edge with guilt heading for the biggest weekly surge on record. This coming is currency trader's brace for a possible intervention with the Japanese yen on track for 10 straight weekly losses. This is sort of the dueling stories of a strong dollar on the other side. Our team coverage starts right now. Tom McKenzie had having to ingrain and Kayleigh Lyons here in New York. Tom, starting with you, can you give us a sense of how much the markets are truly in control in the United Kingdom, even as they search for a new Prime Minister? Well, the markets have put the parameters. They put the guardrails around this race for the next Prime Minister, because if these may have made abundantly clear to the Tory membership, the Tory party, of course, the leading governing party, and everyone here in the UK, frankly, that you need to have sensible financial and fiscal policy, then the markets will punish you if you don't stick to the orthodoxy. Behind me in the House is a parliament. You do have that fierce lobbying now. Behind the scenes are kind of a material atmosphere as the numbers start to add up. So the context is that you are likely to get three candidates who will be put their names to a ballot on Monday, around 9 a.m. at US time. They have to have at least the backing of 100 MPs each. There's 357 members of the Tory party. So that leads three candidates. Currently, the numbers coming through, according to the Bloomberg number crunches, is 52 for Rishi Sunak, the former chancellor of the exchequer, 52 MPs backing him. So he's more than halfway through 28 for Boris Johnson, the former Prime Minister as well, and what would be a remarkable turn of events. This is a man, of course, who's cut his holiday short in the Caribbean to fly back to the UK to gauge the opportunity as to whether or not he throws his hat in the ring. And then there's the former Defence Secretary Penny Morden. She's currently got 16 MPs backing her. So that is the process you get to Monday, it will get whittled down in that ballot of members of the Conservative Party to two. It is likely that the follow-up will the second person within that run-up will probably be pressured by members of the Parliamentary Party to step down. If they don't, it goes to a vote from members of the party outside of Parliament. The deadline is Friday, the 28th. That's when the very latest, they'll have to have chosen a new Prime Minister, but it could come as soon as Monday. You talked about the markets, yes. Today yields up at the pound down. But broadly, as you mentioned, yields have come off this week. Bonds and guilds have been bid. A crucial timeline for markets and investors is that fiscal plan that the current chancellor says will be outlined on October 31st. Question marks as to whether or not that deadline will be kept. And that is crucial for markets. So it's like Jeremy Hunt has a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5279,2022-10-21 13:20:44
16874," Is that fiscal plan that the current chance that says we'll be outlined or not so with the 31st question marks as to whether or not that deadline will be kept and that is crucial for markets? It seems like Jeremy Hunt has provided the ballast for markets that they were looking for. Kaley lines were looking around the world and very much this is all the counter story of the strong dollar and yields going higher with the Federal Reserve hiking. It isn't just United Kingdom that's being forced to respond. It's also questions about how Japan does given that the yen right now is weakening dramatically to the lowest levels that we've seen going back to 1990. Yeah, since June 1990, it's absolutely brutal. It has been brutal for everything in G10 up against the dollar this year, but far and away it has been the worst for the Japanese yen. It has weakened nearly 32% against the dollar on a year-to-date basis. We are north of 151. So that raises the intervention question because remember we already saw it last month and that was when we were at a 146 handle. Clearly we've gone north since then so that intervention wasn't necessarily effective. There's two things to consider here. One being that intervention rarely works when it's only one player in the game. You kind of need collective action. Japan did not have that. The other being there is still the rate differential problem in that every other central bank most notably the Federal Reserve is aggressively hiking interest rates. Japan and Corota at the B.O.J. are doing no such thing. So as we have seen yields moving literally hundreds of basis points in the U.K. in the U.S. in Germany. We have gone 18 basis points on the 10-year JGB yield on a year-to-date basis. Why? Because it's capped at 25 basis points. Traders though are starting to test the bank of Japan on that yield curve control and a great chart here from our very own Valerie Taitel points about the hedging we are seeing for a break in the B.O.J.'s curve control. Look at the Swaps market. The 10-year JN swap at 65 basis points. That is 40 basis points north of the B.O.J.'s target. So clearly Lisa the market here is saying something's got to give intervention in and of itself might not be enough. Thank you so much. Tom McKenzie and Kayley lines this really speaks what we're addressing with Gregory Staples and Stephanie Roth who are still with us about what happens when something breaks Gregory as you take a look at some of the F.X. moves. How much is that what's going to break first are some of these moves particularly in Japan unsustainable. I think ultimately it is. I mean obviously if you go back to your macro economics in college the bank of Japan can do one of two things they can control interest rates which they're trying to do through yield curve control or they can control their currency but they can't do both as long as they're generating an unlimited supply of YAN through purchases of JGB's in the marketplace to control that 10-year rate at 25 basis points. It's going to flood the market with supply via and they can't control the price probably won't change until it grows as term is over in the first quarter of 2023 but until then it's going to be quite volatile and I think continued upward pressure interventions not going to change it. Stephanie Roth final word on this issue. If you think that something is something's going to break and we all spent the last couple of weeks learning about you can pension funds that wasn't the thing that broke the market but in this type of environment something likely cracks and we don't know exactly what what what it might be but we're watching closely and eventually central banks will have to step in. And is there some sort of read through what with the Japanese yen and US equities I mean is that something that you are parsing out. I would say you know surprising how well US equities have held in given what's going on in the backdrop. We think that a lot of the pain isn't a price there and certainly equities would would rally if we do get some intervention from from central banks so we're watching that closely for sure. My thanks to both of you Stephanie Roth and Gregory Staples have a wonderful weekend on this Friday morning coming up the morning calls and later puns are back that's the view of moon these Monica defend.

I'm so excited though Ed Luddloh, thank you so much. I'm excited too. I think it'll be helpful to see exactly where things are at Guilds meanwhile continuing to soar higher and hitting pause on the latest equity rally investors wondering is the honeymoon already over This is a very impatient market. You don't want to get too comfortable It's way too early to say capitulation. I think that's The fed just started raising rates this March we have not seen the real impact",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5282,2022-10-21 13:35:59
16877," the capitulation. I think heroic. The Fed just started rates this March. We have not seen the real impact of tighter financial conditions. That means bumpiness in the market. We've seen the market sell off a lot. Investors seemingly have no tolerance for pain. That potential capitulation. There still work to be done. We're going to get these bear market markets. We're going to be on this roller coaster to know where the roller coaster is going to be on this. It's short. It's sharp. Companies are batting down the hatches and getting ready for choppy or times before we can say this bear markets over. We need to see some of that weakness coming through. We're going to be on this roller coaster to know where. The roller coaster to know where that we're all on. A moon is Monica Defend joins us also on that roller coaster to know where based on the roller coaster of yields ever going to be on the roller coaster to know where the roller coaster is going to be on. We don't think that equity actually ever really priced in a prolonged session. But if you ask me what are our working assumption, we do frame the current outlook within an environment of earnings recession for for this year and prolonged for longer. High higher inflation. And this is obviously reflecting into the current. And this is what is really concerned about the current. They remain quite okay. So let's see how much and what determine a rate for the Fed, for example, will be we stay between 475%. But this is what is really concerning investors. I mean earnings that are running under margin compressions and cash flows that have been reducing so far. Right now really the news of the morning has been in the U.S. and the U.S. going back to 2007. Real yields also climbing to the highest levels that we've seen going back to 2009. And then there was a bit of a retracement after a Wall Street Journal article came out written by someone known as the Fed Whisperer talking about how Fed officials are looking for a 75 basis point rate hike at their November 2nd decision. And then after that more voices saying to pause. And how much Monica is going back to the end of the year. And then we're going to see how high yields can go whether those naysayers on a federal reserve can really get their way and cause some sort of think pause wait for that like time to take effect. Well, you know, we're pretty convinced that November and December. I will see a no quiche fed. So we are we are penciling in a 75 I each. Then when we move into January and February, we see that we do the same thing. And then we see that we have a lot of things that we can do. And then it is unlikely that they will pose because it's their credibility that is a stake. And this was really, really clear to us last week at the time we have been joining the IMS meetings. If you look at the textbook, Taylor rule, 6% terminal rate is what theoretically might help the Fed to go back to target in the past. And then we have a lot of things that we can do. But you know that to get there, the price that you are going to pay in terms of earnings, margin compression, higher yields and economic recession is definitely non-negligible. Wait, 6% terminal rate. Is that possible to you? I think that they will stop earlier just because it is true that Powell, a Jackson all said they will be paying to come. We really need to be focused on inflation, which such an increase, such a fast increase of rates might be detrimental at some point to fiscal stability. So as of today, hard data remains quite good. But we are seeing some cracking in the self-data. If you look at the confidence indicator. And I think that really they can ignore all these kind of costs when it goes to faster increase of rates. Or perhaps they can get to 6%, but the team over at BNP, Pariva expects rates to rise past 5%. We now expect to determine if that funds",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5283,2022-10-21 13:40:33
16878," of rates? Well, perhaps they can't get to 6%, but the team over at BMP, Pariba, expects rates to rise past 5%, writing, quote, we now expect a terminal Fed funds rate of 5.25%. There by lifting policy rates to a sufficiently restrictive stance to cause recession. The recession is likely to start around Q2 2023 and endure for 3 to 5 quarters. Monica from your perspective, how much does that really make the argument for cash for remaining nimble for not being overly invested as the markets catch up with a view that is increasingly higher yields and a Fed that has to do more? The first I agree with the Fed that if we move into 6, we might have a prolonged recession that might last several quarters going into 2024. Even before you see inflation cooling down, every say that it is really important to look at how the economic partner will evolve and cash is a decent hedge if you want vis-a-vis margin compression that honestly, when a spread compression that honestly, when we look at spread, they've not been moving that much and this is kind of weird, no, because it means either the corporate sector is quite safe and we do believe that they might have some solvency issue moving forward. But the resilience of the credit space to me has been really surprising. Well, I agree. I mean, not that it's been surprising overall, but that in particular the high yield space has underperformed in an environment where people would say, well, typically the more leveraged companies would get beaten up the worst. How do you explain this? I mean, do you think that we are entering a credit cycle that people are unprepared for? Or do you think this highlights the resilience and balance sheets that have really gotten flushed with cash and pushed out maturities? I think that there might be some cases of resilience where the balance sheet might really be being reduced, but honestly, we've been getting even more selective over time on the high yield and in general, we do prefer investment grade to, to IELTS. So maybe he's more on the investors' irrational. He's a credit resilience so far. What's your sense about whether there are any spots within the equity space to hire? This is really at this point something that needs to be parked on the sidelines. We have definitely, well, from our regional perspective, we think that the US economy is still in a better shape when compared to Europe. And this is justifying our preference for US equities versus Europe. Then if you look at our sector allocation within Europe, Staples, industrial, IT and utilities offer some nice opportunity, when it goes to the US, also the banks in the US seems to be extremely resilient and the S-Care sector as well. On emerging markets, we've been moving to the kosher start side and we've been reducing also the exposure to China, which remains a really big question mark on what's next. We do believe that the still had irrebalancing as to take place in China so far as the US economy. Monica Defend, you'll be sticking with us coming up on Musk's Twitter deal facing yet another headwind this time from the US government. I'm wondering how much Elon Musk is regretting this impulsive decision to buy Twitter. It's been a huge destruction. It's definitely affected the Tesla stock.

16879," You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in a scene. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? We have a unique way that we go get big new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. We ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? Do we have confidence there? If not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single-threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. In the ultimate output for a company, a share price, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level, and that's where we spend all our time. If you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. There's been so many rumors about this Twitter deal. We don't know what is true and what isn't, and also I'm wondering how much Elon Musk is regretting this impulsive decision to buy Twitter. It's been a huge destruction. It's definitely affected the Tesla stock. There have been a lot of sagas, and this has been yet another one of them in the Twitter story. Bloomberg reporting that the Biden administration is weighing security reviews of Elon Musk's ventures, including his bid to buy Twitter. The department did come out and raise some questions about that after that report came out. Bloomberg's Ed Luddlow back to make sense of all this. Please help us. Good morning, Lisa. There were four key reports on Thursday night, all about Elon Musk, all about Twitter. The first, as you said, according to Bloomberg sources, various individuals across various agencies in DC are looking at security reviews of Elon Musk and Elon Musk's businesses. This stems from his comments around the war in Ukraine, his comments around SpaceX's support for the use of Starlink in Ukraine, and of course, his purchase of Twitter. As you said, this morning, the White House has said it is not aware of any national security review of Musk's ventures in response to that Bloomberg report. The Washington Post reported that Musk is telling potential equity partners in this Twitter deal that he will cut the workforce by 75%. Bloomberg has confirmed that he is telling investors that Twitter in a memo sent to фин staff.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5285,2022-10-21 13:49:02
16880," that he will cut the workforce by 75%. Bloomberg has confirmed that he is telling investors that. Twitter, in a memo sent to him, staff, which sources shared with me say there is no plan for company-wide layoffs. There were talks ahead of the merger agreement being signed in April about cost-cutting measures, but once the agreement was signed, those talks end, no plan for company-wide layoffs. And most importantly of all, in the background, Bloomberg news reporting, according to sources, bankers and advisors on both sides of this deal are getting on with it. They fully expect to have a document in place and for the merger to close by the October 28 deadline put in place by the Delaware Judge 5pm on that date. We also reporting, according to one source, that key banks are just waiting for any day now, Elon Musk, to call in that debt financing, and there's no expectation that the banks will hesitate in providing that $12.5 billion of debt financing. Those are the stories. Perhaps they, because they haven't found the loophole yet in the contract. I have no doubt that they're looking for it. I'd love to. Thank you so much. Twitter, not the only deal under the White House microscope. For more of Bloomberg's Joe Matthew, joins us with other companies facing some regulatory scrutiny. Joe. And we moved to high tech in this case, Lisa. It's interesting the conversation we were having just a couple of weeks ago about the United States cracking down on exports of high end semiconductors. Chips used for artificial intelligence and super computing. We add another layer here with Bloomberg reporting that the administration is now considering clamping down in a very similar way on AI software and technology that surrounds quantum computing. This is very high end technology that kind of moves beyond the ones and zeros that could really change the shape of high tech in the future here in the United States. It does not want China to get its hands on this and what is now really looking a lot like an economic cold war. In terms of the companies here, it is that by the way, moving stocks without any official announcement here. These are just reports in early planning here, but Nora technology, Chinese tech firms like ACM research and PioTech are trading lower. Lisa is long as we're also seeing some US tech companies developing this technology, trading lower today as well. Think Microsoft Intel and IBM. But it's not just tech that could take a hit from regulators here in Washington, as we learn now that two high ranking senators on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat and Republican Mike Lee, are calling for a hearing now in the Albertsons takeover, at least proposed a takeover of Albertsons by Kroger. This is the big grocery merger that's been in the works here. We knew this deal would face scrutiny. Klobuchar and Lee, top officials again on Judiciary, say they have serious concerns about the deal. Andy Truss concerns Klobuchar is pointing as well in a letter now to the FTC, which still seems to regret approving Albertsons takeover of Safeway a couple of years ago that resulted in a bankruptcy and some spin-offs here. So I would expect a lot more conversation about this following the midterms that will begin with a hearing on Capitol Hill and will likely trickle to the FTC, Lisa. Great work, Joe Matthew. And I'm just looking right now at Albertsons shares down more than 24% in early trading, perhaps in the heels of some of the pushback that was, as Joe said, expected because of the big anti-truss to push by this administration. A Mundi's Monica defend is back with us. Monica, we haven't really talked about the potential policy risk because there is a feeling that markets are in charge. Do you think that that is true or do you think that there is policy risk that perhaps is underappreciated? I think that the UK really was an extreme case where we have seen how the trade-off in the policy might actually blow up and have dramatic consequences on the market. So it's really this combination of fiscal and monetary policy at a time of very different target because fiscal has to support the economic path while central banks and monetary policy have to cover inflation to reduce inflation. So these two conflicting targets might really explode as it has been the case in the UK. So hopefully this will be an insulated case, but definitely this is one of the risks we have on our other.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5286,2022-10-21 13:53:23
16881," Explode as it has been the case in the UK. So hopefully this will be an insulated case, but definitely this is one of the risks we have on our other. How much is this really reduced, how much borrowing there can be by governments and fiscal spending because of the bond vigilantes that have definitely spurred up? Well, you really need to look at region by region, because for example, in Europe, we have the other difficult task of fiscal solidarity. For example, so you have many countries that have to vote on unanimity in order to get an energy package that can help the population. It is really not the same in the United States, where if you want, there was more desynchronization between fiscal and monetary. Honestly, it has been all in China, where the two in tandem have been working together. But really, apart the bond vigilantes, I think that top down, we might have an issue of a policy trade-off and a mistake. Monica DeFendt, thank you so much for taking the time. Truly wonderful. Have a wonderful weekend. Monica DeFendt there of Amundee coming up, the market moving events that you need to be watching, that's next in our trading diary. We did see some flip-flopping action ahead of the opening bell. We still see that flip-flopping action, the S&P now, about a half a percent. It just highlights the real uncertainty and concerns about liquidity and where the next shock is going to come from, lack of conviction. This is Bloomberg. The cannot take back all these records. We were thinking big from the beginning. I mean, the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we used sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest of the industry were doing. Time now for the trading diary. But before we get there, let's take a look at the flip of the flopping. Wow, it is flipping and it is flopping the S&P now up. Seven times of a percent blanket. It might be down that just as much. The S&S back up four times of a percent. This comes as we see a retracement in the yields. They had been much higher. Now they're just a little higher on the long end. The short end you're actually seeing yields come down 10 year yields 4.26% of the two yields 4.53%.

Most of us don't spend much time thinking about the grid. The dizzyingly huge system of cables, transformers and outlets that reliably powers our lives. It's an easily ignored change resistant part of the modern world and that's the way we like it. But as we move towards less planet melting ways of producing electricity, the grid is going to have to evolve too. We are seeing so many countries and governments announcing high targets when it comes to decarbonisation and being climate neutral. But this is just one side of the coin. It's not enough to simply generate green energy. We also need to make sure that this transmitted and distributed to the end consumers. The grid of today just isn't equipped for renewables.

Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of miles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5288,2022-10-21 14:01:59
16883," for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is every way you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to there. They love the soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success and so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant but it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5289,2022-10-21 14:06:18
16884," token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter, Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition and Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said, Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants in order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it, but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees, but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5290,2022-10-21 14:10:38
16885," Well, he had mounted that on that damn bone, the bone of the rear. He didn't know that. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem. But he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America, those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines, not in America. Back in the Philippines, Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage, there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives, which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld, but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch, one for a kid fight. And another heating for the branch, one for a teenager, also three times a month. Also, there was a time my father's hospital, who had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise, for not attending the judge, will issue water to the next one. My father passed away in January 13, 2010. After staying for almost one year in the hospital, he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father, I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story, they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19, they didn't have access to their documents about this. But, you know, they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened. And we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to $10 million in those good world payments. But the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster, we know that Pepsi sales dipped. They were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people, Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience. By that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as a coach left its hotel in a south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. This was clearly version of un coke.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5291,2022-10-21 14:15:07
16886," Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as a coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news at every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered mind of the attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article The Get Rich Quick Scheme that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be sort of isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far or maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day we were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Uduna Stadium which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and that one had pierced a seat headrest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5292,2022-10-21 14:19:23
16887," Say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene, claiming jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. It would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism. One of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount out of a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for paulers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gos. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borziah Dortmund shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, inner gold would have made up to 570,000 euros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5293,2022-10-21 14:23:44
16888," If the plot had been complete, the successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, the intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sege, Van Gogh, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Van Gogh had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, stouting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Vaynergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Vaynergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off, but he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5294,2022-10-21 14:28:01
16889," is likely to strike the earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disaster. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence is that safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, but how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing whatever call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environment, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. And it depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, stargazers watched as comets shoemaker levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the earth. And the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large, one kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage. But they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live. And they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids, based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could bias.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5295,2022-10-21 14:32:27
16890," trees asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazards earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous. That when we went into the greater than four in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly there. And then Simon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits. And then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time for let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface. As if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface. You calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors. And come here with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available. You can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility and that's kind of in a way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5296,2022-10-21 14:36:43
16891," I opinion yes, we have lots of options available. You can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off. It's a path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. So it's kind of like bowling, if you will. If you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig. That takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft. And it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting the pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors. And also, we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get a follow-up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about. And not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters, and like climate change, is a problem with the global companies. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem. And nobody takes our ship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he locks a small satellite around the Earth that we're always going and looking outward. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence that's stake, right? Yeah. Well. The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard.

16892," up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore, anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok Fin influencers, one of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Teniv, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Teniv and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting, have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. And today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddalities in the Schwab, the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. This is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood, but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. They remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5298,2022-10-21 14:45:23
16893," after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent, and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 and customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products, come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robin Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robin Hood. They're in the shower, they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, checking their phones in between classes, because notifications pop up, telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18. And by the time I'm 30, which will be 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's risk taking that's dumb. But if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it. But without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives or needs. People telling rumors to each other have been around for 100 years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. Fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits. And Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders affect the two larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5299,2022-10-21 14:49:40
16894," These platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stack market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you guys understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finnfluencers. I think people still care about fashion. They care about culture. But it's also like, there's this big behemoth thing called the stack market that we really don't know a whole lot about. And it's gatecapped behind the industry. And so people want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I have been trading since high school. And it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for a stock, you think it's going to go up. It's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like, options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at said price? And a ton of women just like attack that video. And we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like, I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, the, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the a word, the a l g o word. Because TikTok listens to us. Algorithm does impact how you feel. You do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life, nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch when you get to stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there. But Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette. Leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings, and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets, and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock, and it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time. And others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now, clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yo-lo, their entire life savings are stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am back to lose, everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Bets are novice investors, the community.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5300,2022-10-21 14:54:13
16895," I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warren Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner, pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back and the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Rory and Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying keep going. And it was working too until Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. What we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls and institution art is powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5301,2022-10-21 14:58:25
16896," and situations let them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars, but I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Roryn Kittie were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind, but it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFPs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearned for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5302,2022-10-21 15:02:49
16897," Rural areas have exploded and their poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now, David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods. And it's not that way, but it's not that way. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. It's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. It's just a little bit more than a few miles away from downtown. And it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running at about 119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extremes, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to layout fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to build the infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013 we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020 the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites they've said, hey we know you're all staying home but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth and I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. New condolences to Gemeins, Massachusetts 콤� Zac",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5303,2022-10-21 15:07:08
16898," that does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, either just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law's home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple and easy. So in our area, we have a small imprint of CONCAST, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. CONCAST released a similar statement, encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now, they're a bigger city, but they're a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card.

16899," you're payroll documents or something on to the cloud or to quickly swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for all business owners in rural areas. I think it's a very good challenge. Historically the marginalized people you call them as untouchables are the leads. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. I think education is the best way of liberating them so that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana but it is going to be the source of inspiration, source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teach your ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Telangana social welfare residential schools. So totally about 400 schools I managed, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. My friends also are for them. Of them 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stay in the schools and understand their problems, challenges both in classrooms and the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. What kind of challenges the parents have? One of the important changes that I have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5305,2022-10-21 15:15:48
16900," What kind of challenges the parents have? In the sea, where you can see the volumes, very good night class. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium, because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation. And language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. The result of the decision is also, and final of the new meetings. As far as the audience is concerned about it. Hey, Richard, how are you? I seem to find time here and have a good view. I find the return a lot. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think, that identity will not help you to grow. I am not saying that you should forget your past. I am not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like, you know, you say, I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or, you know, a musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institution, we used to produce about six doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, feet. Pujita has been a form-leberer and a parent, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido-D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usmani Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we have very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We've a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games. We have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, and Brazilian academy. We have a handball academy. So, we have, you know, Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced gold for all. Gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, you know, purists of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5306,2022-10-21 15:20:04
16901," We have gold, we have introduced the gold falls, like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people but today even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students so that we are always interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers, break the fence at least mentally because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people, there are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country, to put it in one word. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. Their stereotypes Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. In the universities, there were in those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusive to mental and social care. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day and day out. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to be a game changer for the marginalized in this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5307,2022-10-21 15:24:24
16902," That's why Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls, and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to cool buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer. There is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5308,2022-10-21 15:28:42
16903," thousand metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect, but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your urban hit island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very micro climate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export maybe even together with its city development system that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5309,2022-10-21 15:33:03
16904," even more than today. Time's a tough job. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? How do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that. I didn't really think of that as being like real money and then it started coming in more and more. And then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. The other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner. And then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or the video starts immediately. You get the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5310,2022-10-21 15:37:22
16905," the little banner ads at the bottom or if you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it the time of year where you are in the quarter. If there is anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue like great example, COVID-19 companies weren't spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every 1000 views you get a certain amount of money. Now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers. And also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off Patreon was really the only option. But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you can become a member and then you get a special icon next to your name I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bands you. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course you have to be on Twitch which is the key platform but basically anyway you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dim playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh no. It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald's straight to VHS movies. Do you remember those?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5311,2022-10-21 15:41:48
16906," any world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird like Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or, you know, or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you, you have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting, all right? Throw in a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is, is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing, is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible, but because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch, purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point, because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so, you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself, when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff, because it takes a while, and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it, my very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page, and one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Thea, and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China.

16907," In some kind of action, it's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million livestream shopping users. China's livestream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's livestreaming the future of shopping. livestreaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many livestreamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtue currency and gifts. In the west, livestreaming is mainly the doing of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search-of-information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of livestreaming, to make the influences actually sell good. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. This is ideal. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction, whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say call this number or something, but livestream shopping is live. Dad in the self is a very big difference. They call this different psychology, and livestream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually, this livestreaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the livestreaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by Tech Giant Alibaba? Added a livestreaming function in early 2016. In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. In the time of the opening, there are still a lot of challenges. The screen's flow, and perhaps it can really go to the environment. It's actually a very high-end and technical cocoa inside. No matter whether it's our user's technology or the top-of-the-line, the difficulty is very high. But in recent years, it's almost over 70 billion dollars worth of goods was sold via livestream on Taobao in the years from March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of livestream users in China were watching shopping shows. And over 65% of them shopped at least once via livestream. In 2020, livestream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people dispense that I'm actually interacting with. And then livestream shopping brings in a lot more of a variety of things that people could buy and satisfy, you know, the sense of like musical control, especially to the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers, which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's livestreaming, you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of livestreaming, VIA, she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipsticks,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5313,2022-10-21 15:50:22
16908," and the biggest sales volume for a long time on Taobao platform. She can sell everything from Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once, so they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. Next, we're going to the real S.A.W.O.D. The king be Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick's brother. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming e-commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany, still and a good income through sales commissions. If you like it, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They're very good at articulating very simply what the product does, what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic. So for VIA and Li Jiaqi, they're able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Jiaqi will always say things about certain products because to him there's his honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Jiaqi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bars, we're going to interesting things that you do. Who may not want to buy lipsticks but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hooked to just an e-bann or a true manager or a trueer company. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. Something we call social proof has taken over meaning that, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in a chat and they ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function and the interactive features like chat rooms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5314,2022-10-21 15:55:01

16910," Don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s. After diver, Rano Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually backwards and forwards that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic vacuum力, elevators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which saved my life.

16911," Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to move to a physician with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetty's and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers under water, mooring or cables, we install on existent man-made structures, and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located on land just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here, and in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid, and our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-dynamic emissions or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5317,2022-10-21 16:07:51
16912,"가락 So can you please tell me? I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where you know people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan made. Can you make a deal with me? I mean, it's a problem. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by a court officials in Yokohana. So Raab Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gown. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gown. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Passe. I'm the former global general council of Nissan Motor Co. Limited. I'm and you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gown saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gown was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gown. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5318,2022-10-21 16:12:24
16913," one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, you know, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry falling under full-blown foreign controls. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that, I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts this might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. The So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pase was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone. And he was told, get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. Hello Mr. Hardy. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renaud and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone. And he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harry Narada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many, many years, he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Narada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. And it just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5319,2022-10-21 16:16:28
16914," Now, that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability. He's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gowne. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. You know, at the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, and they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Posse makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, in great detail, backed up by evidence, backed up by memos, of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. That's unfortunate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5320,2022-10-21 16:20:48
16915," that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, you know, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the Board of Directors, that letter to the Independent Board of Directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend Board meetings anymore and up until that point, I had attended every single Board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to Vice President at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually, he'd lost the coveted General Counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice, this was it around mid-March and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van, just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three, normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times, following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. You all, you people, where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama to basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama court. And they hit to recover a laptop and mobile phone.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5321,2022-10-21 16:25:04

It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain misunderstandings and executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan.

16917," This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seem to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Chautenstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chautenstein in this case that she had against J.P. Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. I included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chautenstein kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfiters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth in around 1990. Some of her wealth were around $90 million. For many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time, her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire estate. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management, it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things, but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences, it was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail, so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. There was air she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not theorize or didn't know about. I was becoming very, very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn, she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back. So the back door and they brought this shredder inside.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5323,2022-10-21 16:33:51
16918," Reading documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning, used to do it the back, through the back door, and they brought this trailer inside, and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers, and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Don, I'm gonna write my feelings in this black book. A diary. It's a diary and she started writing. Each day, she would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. A FedEx package. And in it, were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Don and some other family members take a look at this, and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son, Bobby, had the key to that box. And that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken, the only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity under account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, the granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there. And up comes Bob, you're kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor. And she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible scene. The horrible scene. The horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months of hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars, as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi, we're making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an $80 million account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5324,2022-10-21 16:38:11
16919," He was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect, sort of an $80 million account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandson's as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about $19 million. I reached out for comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm, and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his sons weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say, I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of kind of financial advisors gone bad, or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people who I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. And at the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before, and they crashed into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well, hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day, and potentially had some parts to play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something, the breached market rules?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5325,2022-10-21 16:42:25
16920," Fantastic trade, they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right. Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something the breached market rules in a bid to sort of push the market and that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Commons is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut through a lot of the things that were going on. So Paul Commons is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut through type of world where people are doing, you know, hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. You know, they didn't wear saddle-roes suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. And a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his, you know, oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But, you know, inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits. And in 2005, the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked there, lost their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions, pull commons decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their 20s. And they're, you know, drinking buddies' son. Or they're his own kids' friends from football. You know, they're young lads, hungry and ambitious. And he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders. They're independent. Let's be clear. But they're all part of this collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam deal with Essex. I am from Essex. So I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into this. Sweet, as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a cockney accent, except a guy which he's starting to accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does he? But, you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Faden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live. And it's 20 minutes to chew right away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London. And they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets, it's going to be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking, you're BP's of the world, you're Glencores. But it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious. And at first, we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website, it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching, it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably, we're incredibly curious at this point. Like, who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did, the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together. They would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together, so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5326,2022-10-21 16:46:56
16921," Ham supporters club in London, a few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade probably the most popular is WTI futures contract. And it's basically a contract that says I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230pm. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Now of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130pm that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 208pm exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this has never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. We spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is incredibly risky. That's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know in a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making a $100 million in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. Old trading is a zero sum game. Any time you're making money as an old trader someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5327,2022-10-21 16:51:08
16922," It's losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, Crude Oil Treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having a significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. And the law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately. And they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. Any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. We just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. Potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And in the most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade at settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that they'll go down as legends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5328,2022-10-21 16:55:35
16923," It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. Business community in general saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions. And we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5329,2022-10-21 16:59:44
16924," These are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. And this surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. And they've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI's, this is the Disney World this year. One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up. Diesel Fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has results.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5330,2022-10-21 17:04:10
16925," It's as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals, and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registry set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves, because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there, and those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policymakers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is, is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system. And you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly, in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5331,2022-10-21 17:08:23
16926," MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop, a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobiles and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. As there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5332,2022-10-21 17:12:43
16927," It's show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 test that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Lucia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. And her and I were realizing, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that had gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just normal clothes because of the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one. Launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so and came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. And the number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlopes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5333,2022-10-21 17:17:07
16928," Ex-enable hyperloop could achieve those fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Alib companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for high-prolope range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East-West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today, it'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities, Liverpool Manchester Leeds. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformation. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5334,2022-10-21 17:21:20
16929," Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale Hyperloop test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverging from one track into two, that makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections. And in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network, but in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets or it pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity, and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant. And that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5335,2022-10-21 17:25:43
16930," In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperlip development, heart in 2018 partnered with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada, the goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies run Europe create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project that's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Heart's next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track and the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia which will include a six mile long test track. Using the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperlip. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5336,2022-10-21 17:30:02
16931,"! This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Snam, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossars are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaylee Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years, as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called gray hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Company Svamm about his book The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or on other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5337,2022-10-21 17:34:28
16932," Elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also can hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen needs for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laquah caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is great. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. Anyone else who produces any other rubbish, any other argument, just looking there and saying, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish that I got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, you can every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Portusky, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record, everything super well from Portusky, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom. Right, then that's a real wake up call us a hang on. Green hydrogen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of possible fuel, possible fuel height.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5338,2022-10-21 17:38:43
16933," That's a real wake up call to say hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel, hydrogen, you know it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price but what we know it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah so look I have a call which I'd like to make now that the world should not fund any more called by power stations, coal mining projects ever. We should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue hydrogen. It's cooking the planet. You know, hydrogen to not matter when you're going to electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of Greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for e-stion investments, they're growing exponentially so are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on Greenhagen. That actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel is now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sobriety or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra seriously that Greenhagen is never here to stay. It's broken through. History has been made. It will never go back. Okay what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidizing, you stop using money into possibly. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ask the planet on fossil fuel subsidies because we haven't had that renewable energy. We haven't had that Greenhagen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also excuses are never be commercial. They're never be supplied into quantities we needed. Now we know let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay if we do it now is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth not talking about transition just going from A to B? Yeah it's a fantastic person A to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal burn their oil burn their gas at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere honestly. Well not that honest because they don't measure methane which is 90 times worse than carbon but at least the carbon has been done honestly. Encourage the Greenhagen sector to come in really fast. Okay it's there there's there's renewable power all over the world we know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well right now it is. Okay so let's just swallow that bit of financial data right now it is cheaper and it's getting more check it's it's the only fuel you know it's declining in value. You don't have enough of it right to power the world. Yes that's only because we haven't had Policies to support. We had Policies to support it five ten years ago it would be everywhere you'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference and he policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now okay big business is transacting with greenhouse in multi-pillion dollar a gram.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5339,2022-10-21 17:43:03
16934," We'll just leave this all over the world to appreciate now, okay. Big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's ready to be released. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? The look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight.idellas to us. From Bloomberg's world headquarters in New York, I'm Kaley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant, and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today spoke with Alvera at COP26. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down, where do you see prices moving, because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing, that some argue will still not be the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $1,600. And we see it going down to 50 and five years time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5340,2022-10-21 17:47:30
16935," Once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced the big, big commitment to get the 50% renewables. Are you surprised by it? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit, and even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling cost of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there, and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them act if I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important, and at the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP, and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years. How quick, it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years, or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects, and that's where companies take us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM there speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel, made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day. It can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus, a CEO, spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets, and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident, but we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuel, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time, and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long way to until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over one gig a ton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix.

16936," President between theistles of Disney and the Gundam Pl��orenzo of Cuits oh Don't you know B From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Keeley Limes, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annix, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source and in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $8 per million BTU's for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. And it also leads to a downside though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5342,2022-10-21 17:58:33
16937," For green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas. That's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online.

So if normal is somewhere between zero and five, maybe you're closer to five to ten or some in some cases over that, I think that this is a very difficult time in the equity markets as we've seen. The volatility has just been much wider than expected and we have had the markets come down in multiple compression before we really get an earnings reset. And I think that's the biggest issue going forward besides what the Fed is doing is the earnings reset. And we haven't really seen that yet and I think it's coming.

I was kidding at the top that Taylor Swift dropping her album at midnight last night. And that explains the rally. Because I can't quite make sense of why we sell one day and rally the other. Well, today I think it's more a question of flows than it is anything else. Anything fundamental because I mean, look, from a fundamental perspective, Snapchat came out with some horrible numbers. And three months ago, that would have tanked the whole market because as a kind of proxy for advertising in the macro economy, the idea here being that if advertisers aren't going to do well, it means that they don't think that consumers are going to be buying. And there's a whole spiral right there on the state of the economy. That is not what you're seeing today. And I think that's pretty significant in terms of sentiment isn't driving today's rally. I think what is driving today's rally is fact that you have two trillion dollars of options that are expiring today. So you have a lot of people pulling in and out of contracts. And that's why right at the open, you saw this surge in futures. I should say in the S&P 500, but also futures contracts because people are using those windows of liquidity to once again get in and out. So don't be surprised if going into the clothes. You see some pretty big moves. All right. Hey, Vince, you know, when I started my day, seems like a week ago earlier today with Tom Keane. The story was all about the roaring dollar.

Lawmakers say Trump was the central cause of a coordinated, multi-part effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It is expected this will lead to a protracted court fight. Word of the subpoena comes on a day when former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison for defying a subpoena from the January 6th committee. The judge is allowing Bannon to stay free, pending appeal, and is also imposing a fine of $6500 as part of the sentence. I respect the judge, the sentence he came down with today is his decision. I fully respect him and totally respect for his entire process on the legal side. Bannon says he will appeal. This year's Thanksgiving dinner promises to be the most expensive we've seen.

All right, Nancy Lions. Thank you so much, Nancy Lions, in our 991 newsroom in Washington, DC. So staying on some of the news flow out of DC and elsewhere, we wanted to get to a story. It's actually a Washington Post story about, and I'm reading from the story directly, some of the classified documents recovered by the FBI from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Home and Private Club included highly sensitive intelligence regarding Iran and China. This is according to people familiar with the matter. If shared with others, the people said such information could expose intelligence-gathering methods that the United States wants to keep hidden from the world. Yes, this is not good, and it just seems the news seems to be just dribbling out if you owe more and more. And I'm just not sure, I guess what my question now is, what did the government get back and what are they still missing? Right. And it sounds like from this reporting from the Washington Post that there is still more documents and still very sensitive documents. I'm not sure what the next steps are here. Yeah, again, this is an ongoing investigation. Other documents, according to the Washington Post, described highly sensitive intelligence worked aimed at China. And this gets to why were these documents not stored in government facilities. You guys all know the bigger, broader stories about them, but we do think about intelligence intelligence-gathering. Who gathers it? For any nation, it's always very sensitive information. Lives are often at stake, but it's also about national security, and you do wonder certainly valuable to other people outside the United States. It is. The president has denied wrongdoing in having the documents at Mar-a-Lago claiming in a recent television interview that he declassified any documents in his possession and that a president can declassify information, quote, even by thinking about it. I'm not sure that's how it works, but we'll let the FBI kind of figure all that out. I like the dog ate my homework. Yes, that has the same ring to it, but so we'll have to see. But again, it's the Justice Department, the FBI, hopefully, on top of that. Yeah, Trump spokesman did not immediately respond to the Washington Post request for comment for any morning.

[♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Potted Under Two Arms to go ahead of the closing bell. We're looking at a game this week of roughly 4% on the S&P 500 index today. Another move, fire. The S&P now at 3733 up by 68 points, up just about 1.9%. Holding close to session highs just off it, we've got lots of green on the screen. A 604 point game right now for the Dow up 2%, now the stack up 181 points up now by 1.7% down. Transport's rebounding after yesterday's decline. Transport's are up now by 1.7%. Your 10-year 4.22% the two-year yield 4.50%. Spock gold up 1.5%, 1651 the ounce, while West Texas, in the media crude, up 3.10% to 1%. 8477 a barrel on WTIs. So lots of green to move higher, one notable exception.

16942," exception snap ink that is apparent of snapchat it shares plunging now after earnings by 29.8%. I'm Charlie Palette that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much Charlie get another exception for you check out Cheers of Twitter they're also down. Not as much a snap but they're down about 5%. Yes, they might have some problems with the US government minister musk so it's a little bit of an issue there. Let's get to that story. We bring an Ed Loughlow as a West Coast correspondent for Bloomberg News. He's in our Bloomberg interactive broker studio and Ed okay I guess the federal government saying we might have a security risk with this one Elon Musk. And he owns lots of companies he's buying more companies should we take a look at his deals is that kind of the gist? That's the gist in layman's terms that's a good description right you know sources tell us that across different agencies and DC. They are looking at what muskers said about the war in Ukraine and his engagement with people online about that. They're looking at what he said about SpaceX's ongoing support financially and logistically for the deployment of Starling and Ukraine. And they're looking at him buying a social media platform that might not have as many users as a Facebook but has a really outsized societal influence globally. And they're looking at their options this is very nascent right sources saying that they're considering could they use syphias as a mechanism to look at the Twitter deal given their outside investors. What other mechanisms are there it seems unlikely that syphias can be played but big big big flag. Is this really about Starling because Twitter's been out there and I haven't heard any US investigators start to get involved until he started talking Elon that is about Ukraine and Starling. So one thing really quickly the White House did issue a statement on Friday morning saying they're not aware of any security review on musk and his companies. You know I think the sense we get from sources is that musk is antagonizing the administration right it's not as if musk and Biden have a good relationship. They do not we know that musk often ridicules the president if we're honest on Twitter and the president has not proactively engaged with musk especially in the eb space right very quick to support for and GM not very quick to including on musk in the list of accolades. The security concern on SpaceX is that this is a man that has pretty high level security clearance because SpaceX is the pretty much the provider of choice not just for NASA but the Pentagon as well when it comes to satellite deployment. The way he behaves is a typical of a company executive and one with that level of influence and you know I think sources. What is clearance government clearance do we know we don't know I think that's the part of the point of having a top level security clearance but do you remember in 2019 he went on the the Joe Rogan podcast and smoked marijuana and that raised eyebrows and at that time in 2019 his security clearance was reviewed again. Why because somebody that leads a company that is helping with national defense efforts should they be doing that on the Joe Rogan podcast. Right exactly what the timing here is also interesting because my goodness Elon has to I believe October 28th the closest 44 grand dollar acquisition of Twitter. You know for me the most important on Thursday evening four stories hit the Bloomberg all about Elon Musk and Twitter for me the most important came from our deals and credit team according to sources bankers and advisors are on both sides are working diligently and furiously to get the deal done by that deadline the paperwork the expectation from one source is that musk is going to go to the banks for the debt and the banks will be forthcoming everything is happening for this deal to close and it the last. We get the security and regulatory concern which is interesting I mean. You're saying that government officials have said they're not aware of anything on the record the White House has said it's not aware of anything on Bloomberg sources say they're looking at it I mean again remember specifically on the Twitter angle the purchase of the last Twitter he's building a coalition of equity partners the other keep you piece of reporting from Thursday night he's trying to get more investors right he's writing to them to say hey get involved you got a few million quid right dollars apologies that bring me came out there and now syphias plays into that because many of these investors are non US investors right what do we know about Mr. Mus views about Russia about the war because what he posts on Twitter sometimes and his view of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5348,2022-10-21 18:24:17
16943," on US investors, right? What do we know about Mr. Mus views about Russia, about the war? Because what do you post on Twitter sometimes? And his view of Putin, what do we really know? Because it seems kind of odd what he's posting to Twitter, i.e., maybe where his allegiance is my lie? What I could do for a global audience on radio and YouTube is say, just go to Elon Musk, Twitter account, and read it. It's difficult to follow. He's engaged with players on both sides, the Ukrainian side and the Russian side, which is strange in a war environment to see it play out on Twitter. He caused offence because he suggested, actually, that Ukraine should accept certain terms like annexation, as it currently stands, give the people in those annexed territories a vote to decide if actually they want a future under Russia or not. Many would say, what right does he have to say such a thing? He is maybe an expert in rockets and EVs. Is he an expert in geopolitics? So he's antagonized both sides. And it's been, he's so well followed that when he says something, it's heard. And I think that's the big concern for all of this. He also said something else about Twitter cutting the workforce by 70% of the time. Correct. So the Washington Post report. Well, this is what I'm saying. So he's reaching out to equity partners since he's saying, one of my proposals is 75% head-camera reduction efficiencies, cost reduction, Bloomberg, by the way, confirmed that. And they were cutting jobs already, but this is massive. Well, so I mean, sources sent me last night, the memo that Twitter's chief legal officer shared with the newsroom with the Twitter workforce saying, we were discussing cuts, but that ended once the binding merger agreement was signed in April. I'm told by people in Twitter, they're more upset about the admission from Twitter that job cuts were being considered. Then they are about the ideal unless we cut the workforce, because they feel that management at Twitter have been very inconsistent about how they communicate. Like, one of those, wait, you were talking about this? Yes. No, what you said before. 15 seconds. What's our next focal point for the Twitter Elon? Do you have something on your radar? 5 PM, October 28th. Let's just get it done. It's all up to the banks, I think. Yeah, yeah. Put a fork in it. Call it done. Ed Luthlow. Have a safe trip home. I know you're heading back to West Coast. We love having you on the East Coast. So come back soon. West Coast correspondent Bloomberg News, he's going to be busy as we count down to that Twitter deal. I guess I can. Thanks so. I'm going to be busy as we count down to that Twitter deal.

16945," is Bloomberg Business Week. Are you listening to the Friday edition of Bloomberg Business Week, Carol Master, along with Paul Sweeney of our Bloomberg radio team? And coming up, we're going to talk about the other tensions between US and China. Yeah, it sounds like it's getting worse. And that's not good. I don't think for anybody, but that sounds like it's going that way. All right, we're going to get the low down from Anna Edgerton at DC. But first up, back to Charlie Pellet. We'll be checking on the trading day. Hey, Charlie. Well, hello there, Carol. And we have gone our, so the Hello, Paul, as well. We have got the Boundless. Yes, and P. Nesdeck, all pushing higher right now. We're looking at the best levels. Very close to the best level, 2% runoff right now for the S&P. The Dow up by 2.1%. Nesdeck up 1.85%. The S&P on track for a 4% gain for the week unless something dramatic happens in the next 90 minutes. We've got the S&P up now by 72 points. The Dow surging 628 points. Nesdeck up by 193 points. Wall Street saw another day of stunning reversals, stocks pushing higher, and higher after a treasury sell off-sputtered. The Yen Jumptas, Japan intervened again to prop up the currency. 10-year-yield 4.21%. The 2-year 4.49% spot-gold up 1.6%. 1653-the-ounce West Texas Intermediate Crew up now by about 5% 10th of 1%. WTI 84.95, a barrel. Well, as for the market backdrop, Anika Gupta is a director at Wisdom Tree Limited in London. Clearly, there's a lot of focus being paid on the earnings results that are coming in. And it's been quite mixed so far. We started out quite strong, but now we're getting a lot of guidance coming in from companies across Europe and the US, which is highlighting a bit of a slowdown. So that is definitely also a denting sentiment. All right, well speaking of some of those earnings and for a possible slowdown, SNAP Inc. Now, this is ahead of next week's huge rush of tech earnings, SNAP reported its slowest, quarterly sales growth ever, saying that a decline in advertising spending continues to drag on results at stock plunging today, SNAP dropping by 30% right now. Again, recapping the Dow, the S&P and S.D.K.A.R. 2% gain right now for the S&P. I'm Charlie Pellet and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Thank you, Charlie. All right, well, so it goes. The tech war between the US and China. And today we've got a Bloomberg exclusive on how the Biden administration is exploring the possibility of new export controls that would limit China's access to some of the most powerful emerging computing technologies, is according to people familiar. Yeah, this is big news because it just kind of goes to the tensions that are seemingly building across many fronts between the US and China. And Edgerton joins us and as a technology reporter for Bloomberg News joins us on Zoom from Washington, DC. And I've kind of depicted this whole situation with China and the US. It feels kind of like a technology cold war is really building here. And here's just another example of it. What's the latest? Yeah, I think that's a pretty good way to describe it. And what we see is really a continuation of decoupling of these economies now, especially concentrated in the technology sector. And what's driving this is a real fear from the United States. The China is going to be able to develop really powerful next generation of technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence. And that could be used to improve China's military capabilities, but just something that the United States definitely doesn't want, especially if there's a risk of this kind of cold war that we find ourselves in turning into a kind of hotter war. Anna, I got to say, game on, because I've been talking with a lot of executives from the sea suite and content, in technology, and elsewhere, and leisure. And they are all pairing back their expectations when it comes to China. This isn't just talking anymore. They are rethinking any kind of growth strategy when it comes to the Chinese market. When what are you, when what you are hearing in general, that's the case, right? In terms of what we're seeing out of DC. And it doesn't feel like it matters whether it's a Democrat or Republican in the White House. Absolutely. That's two really good points. Some of the executives that I was familiar with have described this relationship with China as declining, for sure. The only question is on what trajectory, whether it's kind of a slow sputtering or if we're going to see a really big drop off in our ability to relate to the world's second biggest economy. And your other point was good as well, that this is an area of bipartisan concern. We have from Pete.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5351,2022-10-21 18:37:38
16946," really big drop-off in our ability to relate to the world's second biggest economy. And your other point was good as well, that this is an area of bipartisan concern. We have Republicans and Democrats being very concerned about the rise of China and the kind of increasing tension that we see with that country. So there are actions that the White House can take like we reported, you know, the export controls that we saw beginning of this month and future export controls on additional technology in addition to things that Congress can do. So regardless of who comes to power after next month's midterms, we expect to see a big rationing of the tensions from bipartisan action in Congress as well. And I see in your news story here, you talked about quantum computing. Why were you just doing that last night? Exactly, of course, in my phone, I think. What is quantum computing and why is it maybe deserved of some oversight here? Yeah, so the main difference between quantum computers and regular computers is that where if you think about a phone book where a regular computer would look at each number one at a time, you know, in some cases very quickly, a quantum computer could look at all of the phone numbers and the book at the same time so that incredibly speeds up what these kind of technology is ready to do. This is still very nascent technology. This is still being developed. It's not reached its full potential. There's a huge concern about the power of quantum computers when they are fully developed. They'll be able to do things like break down the security infrastructure that we have under current computing, you know, and do passwords to break encryption. And that's a really scary prospect when so much of our economy is based on technology, based online, to have quantum computing capacity in the hands of an adversary would be a very scary thing. Anna, when you talk to executives and you guys do your reporting, how much of concern to is, all right, so we're cutting off China increasingly, but what does that mean in terms of the flow from China back to the United States? Is there concerns about that as well? Yeah, there is a fear about some of the collateral damage at this type of measure, but what we're hearing right now is that that's worth the risk to keep this technology out of the hands of, you know, people in countries that we wouldn't want to have it. One concern that I've heard is just the decision on where to draw the parameters for this kind of measure. Like if you're going to put export controls on software related to artificial intelligence, it's actually a hard thing to define. So the challenge for administration officials right now working with industry experts is just to figure out kind of where to draw the box around that technology, where to set that definition to set those parameters so that there isn't additional unintended consequences. And more technology brought into these controls that really shouldn't be beholden to any new rules that are going to place. I think from the big tech companies like Microsoft, like an Intel, they had an opinion here. An analogous quickly. Yeah, we're just looking to see how industry experts are weighing in with the administration, offering their expertise on what's the best way forward. All right, we're going to leave it that. I must read a Bloomberg exclusive, USI, expanding China tech band to quantum computing and AI, and really laying it out and explaining it to us. Anna Edgerton, she's technology reporter up Bloomberg News joining us via Zoom from Washington, DC. You know, it was, was it like, I feel like a couple of years ago people started to talk about this division that it was a tech war, not just maybe a traditional war, and we're seeing it really play out. We are. And again, I'll be interested to see, you know, how far it goes and what the, what that fallout is. Yeah, all right. Let's get back to world of national news. We're going to stay in DC and check in with Nancy Lyons. Hey, Nancy. This is Carol, the House committee investigating last year's attack on the Capitol has issued a subpoena to Donald Trump demanding the former president account for his actions under oath and initiating a legal showdown. We get more from Bloomberg's Joe Matthew. This is the results of the committee's vote in its final hearing held just over a week ago. Mr. Chairman, on this vote, there are nine eyes and zero nose. The resolution is agreed to. The subpoena directs Trump to provide documents by November 4th and testimony beginning November 14th for however many days it takes again. Bloomberg's Joe Matthew, host of Bloomberg Sound on her daily here on Bloomberg Radio at 5 p.m. Wall Street time.

16947," Wall Street time. Trump's subpoena comes on the day that Trump's long-term advisor, Steve Bannon, was sentenced to four months in prison and received a $6,500 fine for refusing to comply with the subpoena from the House Committee. David Shown is Bannon's attorney. We will be filing a notice of appeal as the judge indicated. Very grateful to the judge for thinking through the issues candidly. Shown believes the appeal in this case is bullet proof. President Biden is making the case for his handling of the economy. Today, my administration announced that this year the deficits fell by $1.4 trillion. The largest one-year job in American history, $1.4 trillion declined in the deficit. I will repeat that. The largest ever decline in the federal deficit. Biden says under his predecessor, the deficit went up every single year.

Thank you so much. Nancy Lions, Inter 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. I'm Karl Maser, along with Paul Swini. Hey, everybody. The U.S. Northeast is so short on heating oil that the fuel, excuse me, used to power home furnaces is being rationed even before the start of winter. Do you have oil? Are you gas? No, gas. This story, I found, you know, you think about the energy shortages that you think about war-torn Ukraine or just Europe in general. I didn't think it was going to be a thing here, but apparently in the Northeast, there is, you know, a shortage of heating oil and diesel as well. And so people have been trying to, the price has been reflecting it. And it's going to be very expensive for a lot of folks, particularly in the Northeast, who rely upon heating oil to kind of fuel their homes and businesses. You know, we see the trucks around, right? Neighborhood, you know, who's getting oil, who's not. Some wholesalers in Connecticut are putting the retailers on allocation, meaning they can only get a limited amount of fuel based on availability. This is according to Chris Herb, president of the Connecticut Energy Markets Association, which represents around 600 family and retailers in the state. These retailers must in turn rush in their customers. Now we talk about sentiment and how important it is. You start getting rations. Oh, yeah. Talk about a sentiment, basically. Exactly. All right. I'm going to get a little geeky here for you. A main hurdle to replenishing regional fuel supplies has been a steep, sustained, backwardation in the diesel market. Backwardation happens when prompt deliveries like today are priced higher than they would be over deliveries in the future. So that's really kind of one of the big issues here. Just a trading perspective and a pricing perspective. There's been, and that's what I think the authorities are trying to do. It's just kind of prevent if they can buy just panic buying by, you know, people in businesses. Unbelievable. So listen to this guys. Wholesale heating oil in New York Harbor average $4.9 a gallon yesterday compared with $2.46 at the same time of year ago, according to data from a price reporting agency, August media. So that's a big difference. Yeah. That's, yeah, that's a big difference. And people will see that this starting just about now is we, you know, head into late October. So an issue for folks in the Northeast. It's going to be my dad all over again. Shut the door. Lower the heat. Come on.

16949," That gets into the thousands of Russian working professionals that have escaped to neighboring countries. freelance contributor villa marks former Bloomberg colleague I might add reports on how they got out and what their departure means for their Russian homeland. He joins us on the phone from London along with the editor of Bloomberg Business Week jail web or he is in our interactive broker studio reading through this story man. It's just you get an idea of what these people are going through. Yeah, so so film came to us with this and said hey, there's this group of people that have obviously left the country following Putin's conscription. And he basically said like I can get access to them and tell their stories and he did this so quickly because it's like such an ambitious feat of reporting to have turned around. Since this is just just a couple days ago weeks ago really that this went down and what it showed to me and us, I think and what I think readers are going to get from. It is sort of this desperate way out of the country. You know, it's basically gives you a road map of you know worst case scenario. You got to get out of Russia. What does it look like? And the real interesting takeaway here is the num the scale it which this is happening really paints a dire picture of what the Russian economy which was already seems like it was a really bad place seems like it could be even worse. So so film take us to this chartered flight that you found out about and tell us how all of this went down. Yeah, so I have a friend from college who's Russian and I think you and I were talking a few weeks back and I said I've got this friend and he just arrived in Armenia and he said he's got lots of other friends who. I've been playing cities like Moscow and some Petersburg and through that friend I built out a much larger network of individuals many of them working in areas like it finance and started speaking to them and realize that two of the cities where a lot of younger. The professionals were going were to believe in Georgia and back who the capital of Azerbaijan and speaking to folks there in the coup turned out that a couple of entrepreneurs who would base themselves their months earlier but following the start of the invasion you create realizing that stability in Russia was not going to be part of their future they've set up a co-working space and as the situation got. It's a lot of people after the announcement of the organization they decided that given how expensive the remaining few flights out will be coming they should actually try and charter a plane and get dozens of friends and friends and acquaintances out of the country charge them essentially cost price for the ticket which was sharing the total fee between the 55 of them on the first flight that it to flight and. And through that I met a network of people who arrived on these flights and dropped everything essentially and arrived in back who many of them deciding to set up a new life there. I think their families will join them and then not to the future. Willem is there a risk that or what is the feeling among the people you met with about Putin shutting down the borders is this feel like it's the last days or last weeks before that people can potentially get out. Interesting question of all that actually that was something that a lot of them said had been the real driver for them to get out as quickly as they did the announcement of the 21st most people I spoke to. I bought tickets by the 24th of the September most of them are out of the country by the end of the month because the big concern was not necessarily that they would be drafted or conscripted as part of the special mobilization more that they would be trapped in Russia. And if that mobilization continued in the months and years ahead they would get dragged into a conflict they just simply didn't support. Fill me right these people typically lack the wealth and swagger of the oligarchs at the commanding heights of the Russian economy but their loss is sure to have a negative impact what will be or what might be their expected impact on that Russian economy. You're talking about hundreds of thousands of people carol people who understand the software industry who work as engineers have creative roles within important companies in Russia they are the generation typically let's say 25 through to 50.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5355,2022-10-21 18:54:38
16950," who work as engineers that have creative roles within important companies in Russia. They are of a generation, typically let's say 25 through to 50, where they are the future CEOs, the future executives of Russian businesses. And by leaving the country, that will constitute a brain drain which we've never seen at this scale in a century or so. We've had people brightest minds across the country, leaving Russia, of course, over the last 20 to 30 years, you think it would be quite a Sergei Brin. But what's happening over the last few weeks could have profound invocations for months, ahead, years ahead. And just talking to one expert at Chatham House who runs the Russian Eurasia program, he made a really interesting point. As Russia continues to focus its efforts on investment in hydrocarbons at a time when the world is drawing away from oil and gas. Did you then add to that this compound effect of bright younger professionals leaving the country, those that don't work in those industries? What does that lead Russia with in 10, 20, 30 years from now? And his conclusion was not a lot. So, Villum, who's benefiting from this as all this talent seeps out across the border? Where are they going? And where are those countries, who are the countries who benefit here? Well, a lot of them know what Russians think of the near abroad. That's modern terms, former USSR states, such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan. These are countries where the older generation at least still speak very fluent Russian. Russians tend to be able to visit there without the need for a visa. And in the major cities, Almaty, Baku, Deblisi, Bishkek, there are large numbers of very qualified people with specialist skills, setting up by the businesses, trying to find local work, creating co-working spaces, professional hubs, and the potential economic engine they provide is substantial, particularly when it comes to areas like IT, particularly FinTech, finance. And the challenge, of course, is that they also potentially bring with them political headaches for their host governments, host countries. They will be concerned about potential diplomatic risks with Moscow, if it's seen as a place that is welcoming these talented Russians. So, Willem and Kyrgyz, such a cool story, feed of reporting. What did you learn quickly to wrap? I learned that there's a lot of people across the state, Trim and Russia, who really don't believe in what's been happening in Ukraine over the last few months, and have over many years been incredibly pessimistic about what's happening across the country, and that suddenly has come to a culmination point where they've decided enough is enough. All right, we're going to leave it on that note. An incredible read, and I highly recommend everyone go to the Bloomberg terminal and online to really read all of the details and the reporting. That's in Willem's story. Willemarks, thank you so much. Great to hear your voice, freelance contributor at Bloomberg News, joining us on the phone from London.

We're going to take a look at the shares of snap down oh boy 29 30% really calling the question the revenue story here and that is a concern not just for snap fewer people staying on the platform advertisers pulling back but it also goes to the other social media platforms we've seen some weakness bleed over into some of those names as well. So it's really going to be an ongoing issue for these companies. If this country goes into recession what happens to add spending? Yeah marketing costs a very easy switch to just dial down a little bit over in corporate America and so we obviously the ramifications snap currently brutal off by 30% let's look at the rest of the benchmark because snap of course relatively speaking it's a bell weather but it's not going to big market caps so it doesn't affect the NASDAQ we're currently off by 1.8% well we're higher by 1.8% on the NASDAQ we're seeing more than 2% climb for the Dow 73 points higher that's 2% on the nose for the S&P 500 3,738 the roster 2,000 also up almost 2%. When you talk about what's leading this higher at least on this particular day it's not tech it's actually materials it's energy and some of the financial stocks in fact consumer discretionary and the tech sector.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5357,2022-10-21 19:03:47
16952," When you talk about what's leading this higher, at least on this particular day, it's not tech, it's actually materials, it's energy and some of the financial stocks, in fact, consumer discretionary and the tech sector, kind of in the middle of the pack there, nevertheless all 11 sectors right now are in the green, including real estate only up about a tenth of a percent, but it gives you some idea to the broad-based nature of this rally. On a weekly basis, it is tech out front, and in fact Netflix is the best performer on a weekly basis in the S&P 500, up 26% over the last five days, 8% here on this particular day. The second best performer on the weekly is actually Schlumberj, up 10% here on the day and about 19% on the week. The company actually posting its best profitability that we've seen going back for at least seven years. Meanwhile to the downside, keep an eye on tenant health care, those shares down 32% right now. It's the second worst performer on a weekly basis in the Russell 1000. The outlook that it gave was quite interesting here. Higher costs and of course a lot of concerns here about some of those more lucrative, elective type of surgeries and medical treatments, not necessarily getting back to those pre-pandemic levels. And of course the Elon Musk Twitter Circus that continues, remember there is a court order deadline next Friday for that deal to be closed or that trial then gets renewed. Twitter shares down 5% here on the day, back down at 50 bucks a share. Meanwhile of course all this tumult on the micro basis, we look out to the macro, really how it hits sentiment or not as a case maybe. We've heard a lot of hand ringing from Bank of America of course, Michael Hartlin and the Lyke of his team talking about whether we're at absolute capitulation levels. Well not when you're actually looking at fund flows, US stocks, we actually saw money move in to the tune of $12 billion for the week of October the 19th, global stocks, 9 billion, we are seeing significant drawbacks in bond funds and indeed in gold. But really it's still actually though, you counteract the equity story with money still going into cash. Yeah, interesting to see that and maybe it makes sense against you know the backdrop in terms of what we expect from the Fed. Although it's interesting guys, I don't know if the drumbeat, the Fed drumbeat is kind of softening in terms of the hawkish moves. So we did hear from the president of the San Francisco Bank we're talking about Fed Bank. I should say Mary Daley, who weighed in on what we might be seeing when it comes to Fed moves. Check it out. What you see is growth below trend in 23, GDP growth below trend, policy tightening that gets the rate up next year between 4.5 and 5%. That one policy tightening that raises and then holds because we have to keep the rate at a tightened level, tightening level in order to fully reestablish price stability. Of course, that's the president of the San Francisco Fed, Mary Daley there at an event earlier today. She did say, you know, starting to talk about slowing down though their rapid pace of recent increases in their benchmarks. So it does feel like maybe a little bit of a starting up that hawkish tone. But what do you make of the fact that when we heard from Charles Evans, there was of course the comments from yesterday and then this recorded a message that now it's being released. This idea of sort of a recommitment to making sure that they get inflation back down to that 2% target. And in leasing his words, this idea that recommitment though, I mean, have they changed or well, his exact words were still committed to restoring inflation to a 2% target. Those are his words, not mine and really just this idea here that they have a lot more work to do. So it kind of raises the question of where does the discussion of a pause or even a rollback of this even begin. You know, one of the names we like to talk about a lot is Apple stocks up about 2.3% today. But some really surprising news here before they open this morning, Apple's head of hardware design, Evans Hanky, she said she's leaving the phone maker three years after taking the job and she just took the job in 2019 and replaced the famed the iconic Johnny Ive in terms of design at Apple. So it's very, it's fairly rare that we get turnover and the senior ranks at Apple. So that's a big move in for the Apple followers out there. I'm going to say this is like the Thanksgiving dinner where we're kind of debating about interest rates and like someone's like, can I save us? Can I save us from ourselves? Could you pass the potatoes? Well, it's like the crypto chat really around them. It is, it is. Workers, I don't know. I feel like every day we come in and we either get an up day or a down day, Caroline based on the Fed conversations that are going on our expectations in the market. Well, what turned it around maybe wasn't the Fed, but the bank of Japan? And that is where the intervention came from. This is a central bank that has had enough with one sided moves. They've talked, they hinted at it, they said they will come and finally the market got where they asked for a sudden shoot higher. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5358,2022-10-21 19:07:43
16953," This is a central bank that has had enough with one-sided moves. They've talked, they've hinted at it, they said they will come, and finally the market got what they asked for, a sudden shoot higher. Yeah, okay, well I'm gonna ask someone to pass the Mac and cheese here. And just pivot ahead to earnings next week. I mean, what we saw just a few hours ago with regards to the moves and dollar yen was really just remarkable. And as soon as it sort of hit the wire, everyone said basically, nothing can move a currency pair like dollar yen in that way, other than a central bank or some other massive player. And at least based on the reporting by Nikkeh, that appears to be the case. I do want to go back though to Paul, he had brought up Apple, because we do get Apple earnings next week. But more importantly, let me get basically the other really big tech companies, right? The Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, I think Meta's in there as well. I might be forgetting a couple of others, but this idea of whether that's going to be enough to save this market. We saw, of course, Netflix surprised to the upside. The question is can those other companies, the biggest way that one's in the S&P, also surprised to the upside? Yeah, I think what we're probably going to find next week is those that have an advertising exposure, they're going to be able to really call that out as a little bit of a headwind there. So think about the Metas of the world. But for those that are in his software space, maybe the cloud space, what we're hearing from the analysis, spending remains pretty darn strong here from some of the key customers. So I think it's going to be, you know, the expectations are still pretty good. Yeah, did you see the results out of the Oracle's event they had out in Las Vegas, where they kind of gave that 2026 target? And the fact that they could give a 2026 full cost is striking. No, interesting. All right, did you hear Turkey's going to be more expensive? Yeah, I did. I'm few of them fall between. Yeah, no, it's going to be more mac and cheese rather than the Turkey. All right, guys, why don't we Turkey at other times of the year? It's just that we just save them up for Thanksgiving. Is that how it works? Because I mean, no, but I don't go over anyone's house in June. And there's a turkey on the table, right? I mean, it's basically what? It's Easter Thanksgiving. And do you remember how I got Turkey on the sandwich, though? No. Well, no, you're missing out. You're missing out. We got to go. We'll be back. It's good. It's good. We will be back in less than an hour's time. We're going to wrap up the Friday trading day, wrap up the week, our cross-platform coverage beyond the bell. Radio TV YouTube, we're going to count you down the close on this Friday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. All right, folks, we will rejoin our TV colleagues to count you down to the closing bell at 4 p.m. Wall Street Time right here on Radio TV and you, too. What a week, man. Yeah, I mean, it's a good way to end it here. I mean, get the S&P up solid, 2%. It's been trading solidly up all day. Good volume out there as well. So a good way to end the week. It looks like we're, too. Just get some numbers week over all. I think we're up more than 4% for all of the major equity averages this week. So it's a quite a bounce back. And good volume. I mean, the volume today in the S&P 500 is 17% higher than its trailing 30-day average. So you got some conviction in there. I always think it's interesting, too, if you kind of end on a stronger update, right? Hiding into the weekend for me, it kind of says something. But do you believe like the names that we're going to get in terms of earnings that could change sentiment easily next week? We saw it last quarter, right? We had that little rally there coming into July and based upon a large part on some of the good earnings, particularly out of the tech companies, just better than expected. Not great, but just better than expected and let's see what the guidance is like. Right, and this environment will take that. All right, let's get back to World of National News for that. We're heading back to DC, Nancy Lyons, hey, Nancy. Thanks, Carol. The House Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol has issued a subpoena to Donald Trump. We get the details from Bloomberg's Joe Matthew. This is the same subpoena that the committee approved in a unanimous vote during last week's televised hearing expected to be its last. It says the former president must provide testimony starting November 14th and continuing for as many days as needed, also directs Trump to hand over documents by November 4th. Bloomberg's Joe Matthew hosts a Bloomberg sound on. You can hear it here on Bloomberg Radio at 5 p.m. Wall Street Time. Steve Bannon, one of Trump's political advisors, defied us a subpoena from the January 6th committee. And today he received a sentence of four months in prison and a $6,500 fine for contempt of Congress. The judge said the sentence would not take effect while Bannon appeals, which he said he will do, adding that a Republican election win will help.

All right, Nancy, thank you so much. Carol Maser, Paul Swini here at our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. We are streaming on YouTube and you talked about Apple and there's seven of them with you as we like. Six of you. Because it does feel like the interesting conversations that we have with our TV colleagues, we all go through. It's like back and forth. We're like, wait a minute. We get so little tense. It was a really good way you did. Yeah, it's good stuff. Bring it up, Apple. I like Apple. Have you always talked about Apple? Everybody likes to talk about Apple. Yeah. And one of the reasons that Apple's worked so well for investors over the years is that they have such a solid management team. We saw that succession planning, not a lot of turnover, but we had a little bit of news. Apple's head of hardware design, Evans Hanky, announced that she is leaving the iPhone maker three years after taking the job, creating a significant, significant hold to top of a company famous for its slick looking products. And that's according to people with knowledge of the matter. What's interesting is Hanky was named to the post in 2019 and replaced Johnny Ive, the company's iconic design chief for two decades. So you think about a two decade run for Johnny Ive, Evans Hanky, very well thought about out in the valley, stepping down. Right. Someone who was familiar with Johnny Ive and knew kind of, I would say like a disciple of, right? So to pass the baton, it probably wasn't easier, kind of move even though he was so identified with the iconic designs that have come out of Apple. And the story, it says her exit or pending exit marks the first time that Apple will be without a defective design chief since Coffin or Steve Jobs retook control of the company back in the late 1990s and appointed Ive to the job. So you do wonder, I mean, this is a company, right, that we cherish the designs that come out. Yeah, it's just, it's extraordinary what they've done. It's extraordinary, you know, kind of just, you think about all the Apple products you have. And it's just, it's just amazing and how they're all interconnected. It's a system and it's obviously that drives their services business because I got to get my iTunes and I got to do all that kind of stuff. But if you're out of the Apple ecosystem, like my oldest son is, he's like an outcast. I know. And it faced time as a group, you know, it's, it's crazy. And the elegance as this story says of Apple's products has been just so key to the company. Go ahead. Sent by",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5360,2022-10-21 19:16:32

From Bloomberg World Hanquaters, I'm Charlie Pellet Stokes. Keep on going up another 705 points right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a Friday ahead of a week and lets head right over to the first word breaking news desk for today's afternoon call. Here he is Bill Maloney. Good afternoon Charlie, US stocks are surging today, helped by a Wall Street Journal article saying that some Fed officials are signaling greater unease with big rated rises to fight inflation. Like you said, Dow's currently up 705 points, S.A.B.s gained 83 and Nasdaq, rises by 2.1%. The US 10 year old F4.21, gold is up 26 and energy is in the green. Bitcoin is trading higher by 0.7%. Among the main 11 S.B. sectors, only telecom was in the red and leaders stood the upside down, catapillar, japer-morgan and Goldman Sachs, while Verizon fell 4% after earnings and led to the downside. Also after earnings, American Express fell 3% and wrapping things up the Wall Street Journal all reported that banks may sell up to $13 billion of Twitter debt around the end of the year. Live from the first of breaking news desk on Bill Maloney, Charlie. Okay, Bill Maloney, we thank you and to hear a live breaking news over you of Bloomberg type Squawk S, QUAWK on your terminal line, Charlie, how did that? Is a Bloomberg business flat? All right, Charlie, thank you so much. So remember earlier this week, we talked about, this was with Bloomberg's Max Chaffkin about how Mark Zuckerberg is all in on the metaverse, right? Focusing on that rather than Facebook, the company he created and is still really the big business behind meta despite the name change. So, Zuck is all in on the metaverse and Paul Soatou is our next guest. Yeah, absolutely. I'm not really sure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5361,2022-10-21 19:21:00
16956," He created and is still really the big business behind meta despite the name change. So Zuck is all in on the metaverse and Paul So2 is our next guest. Yeah, absolutely. I'm not really sure what the metaverse is, but I think I'll know it when I see it. I'm not sure. But Anne Han, she knows it. Anne is the chairman and chief executive officer of Super League gaming joining us on Zoom from Los Angeles. So Anne, let's start out, particularly for the folks that are out there in their cars driving around. Let's just start out really simple to you. What is the metaverse? Yeah, it's a great question. And if you ask 10 different people, you're going to get 10 different answers. The way that I simply try to talk to both investors and some of our larger brand partners about is the first kind of part of the metaverse is metaverse games or what we call open world platform games. And in those games, instead of you going in and just playing a game that served up to you, you're actually given tools to create your own games and experiences. And there's no limit to what that gamified experience can be. It can be concerts, fashion shows, it can be all kinds of things. Metaverse game or open world platforms have been around for over a decade. It's platforms like Minecraft and Roblox and now increasingly Fortnite. You don't need a VR headset. And you can participate in those experiences as a creator or as a viewer or player. Right now, today hundreds of millions of kids are already there and Superlegs build a pretty big footprint there. We've reached 70 million unique under 18 gamers a month in those worlds alone. So the first thing I say is big meta, maybe five years away, but metaverse games don't be afraid of them. They're around that's where kids play. They prefer those types of game modes where they can be the creator as well to traditional video games. Now that said, I do think that bigger meta is going to continue to happen faster than we think. There are companies building out the engines so that you don't just have to use Roblox and Minecraft to create these experiences. Big brands, iconic IP will be able to create their own worlds and interact with their fans and gamify things and monetization around those fans and own that full user and that monetization stream and that's not far away, that's happening really now and over the next one to two years. So I think it's going to be gradual and I personally for me, I don't know if I'll ever be the person wearing a VR headset for 10 hours a day, right? That big meta vision, but what I can give comfort around is it does exist right now in these game platforms. So is it all, you know, when we think about the metaverse or big, big, or meta, is it just with a gaming component, is everything with a gaming component or is it the way you see it? I know you're an esports community and content platform, so that's your world, but is it something even more wider than that? Yeah, no, thank you for that question because we do get quality sports a lot and yet we are so much bigger than that now. When we talk about those 70 million monthly players, we're talking to all kinds of people who are seeking community inside these game based platforms, but super league isn't really just a gaming company, we gamify experiences. And so to your question, it's much bigger than that. We helped Samsung earlier this year bring Charlie XCX into the metaverse for a concert. We ran the red carpet for the MTV VMA Awards inside a digital world where your digital avatar could participate in that experience, even if you don't live anywhere near New York where they have legs. That's all we want to know. No. Yeah. Well, I went in and I kept knocking the paparazzi over by accident. So like, you know, if you're bad at it, you just really by accident. No, no, just kidding. Well, let me tell you, and this is a real time example right now. We've had the pleasure of helping Mattel take their steps into met these metaverse games. And right now, you can go into one of our game worlds called Live Topia and you can hang out in Barbie's Dreamhouse. We've created a three story digital version of Barbie's Dreamhouse. You can swim in the pool, lay on the chase lounge, go hang out in Barbie's closet and dry on clothes. Those aren't to all of us, again, traditional video games. That's about community. It's a digital cul-de-sac. It's people finding people they want to socialize with. And so super league has come a long way because we now have the kind of reach where we can speak to the Barbie girl.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5362,2022-10-21 19:25:03
16957," It's people finding people they want to socialize with. And so, super league has come a long way because we now have the kind of reach where we can speak to the Barbie girl, the Hot Wheels boy, that older demo that may be a Samsung or MTV wants to reach. Because here's the reality. Everybody is a gamer these days. And it's not just hardcore gaming, like we tended to think about it five, 10 years ago. All right, just real quickly. What's the business model here? Do I sell advertising against this audience? Are we charged them subscription or business model? Yeah, the primary business model is that we work with brands and partners to take them into the metaverse worlds that we already operate ourselves or our part of our extended network. We have several hundred game worlds. So when a brand like Mattel comes to us, we can say, look, here are the types of game worlds that we really think matches your target audience. Here's the experience that we think is right. And then we have some pretty special proprietary ad technology, media tech, and analytics. And what that means is, is we may have built Barbie's dream house in one world, but we have 3D Barbies characters walking around digital avatars and other worlds directing traffic to it. I think in the first two weeks of Barbie, we had over 32 million visitors to her dream house. So we're talking about really outstanding numbers as far as engagement, but also deep engagement, you know, hanging out 25, 30 minutes at a time. And come back soon, because I would love to get deeper into the monetization of those millions, whether it's Barbie's dream, Barbie Dreamhouse or others. I'd love to talk more with you. And Han, she's chairman CEO of Super League Gaming. Stuck, though, by the way, down about 71% so far this year, it's a small cap microcap, you might say. She was joining us via Zoom from LA.

Now what about the Federal Reserve and the outlook there for rates? Claudius Som is Director of Macro Economic Research at the Jane Family Institute. I think at this point anyone that's talking about the first half of next year there's a lot of false confidence. I would not be surprised how fragile financial markets are. The Fed has to pause to get them back under control. In a week where home building stocks have been hit by surging US Treasury yields and data showing weakening demand for homes one analyst is throwing in the towel on the sector.

I try to thank you so much we appreciate it. Tom Keens in that here so we can talk crypto. I'm looking at a one crypto. Well he kind of poof who's it as you might imagine. I'm looking at one chart of Bitcoin 60 thousand dollars per token. Today as I look on my hand screen 1981 80 that is a tough market environment and when you have headwinds like that you can see some shake us in the sea sweet. That's what we're starting to see in a crypto space with the story Mike Regan senior editor for Bloomberg markets. He joins us live in the Bloomberg interactive broker studio so he gets a gold star for me for coming in the studio. Mike talk to us about what's going on. Crypto talk about the crypto winter things are tough out there. Maybe it's just the evolution of a young marketplace. What's your reporting show you well thanks Paul and first now I know why Tom never talks to me anymore. I thought it was something I said but that it all makes sense now but yeah you know basically we noticed as the you know crypto winter continued to get chillier and chillier that there was just this drum beat every day of another resignation another resignation you know some of them kind of not too surprising if you look at the likes of Celsius network that's the big kind of crypto shadow bank that's in bankruptcy now voyage your digital another crypto startup that's in bank bankruptcy okay not too surprising when a company like that shakes up their sea sweet but we started keeping track of them and you know of the big sort of well known firms there's at least two dozen departures there's likely a lot more of sort of the smaller fringe companies that that we didn't track so closely. And you know we started talking to some experts some people in the market saying well what's going on here and I think not to date the three of us but I think we watch it buddy. The three of us I will say this we all remember what life was like before the internet right yes and we remember we remember I remember doing a piece explaining what the internet is first you need a computer but but you know we all remember sort of these larger than life personalities from the dot com boom the startup founders Steve case right you know and and these just sort of really larger than life personalities and the same thing is true of crypto I think Alex Machinsky of Celsius is a great example you know here's someone who is you know really styles themselves as like a revolutionary almost someone who's trying to topple the traditional financial world similar to the way so many people tried to disrupt brick and mortar business with the internet back in the day but then what happens is you get the shake out in the market right you know we have the dot com bust now we have the crypto bust and what's interesting is all along the way the traditional finance firms your fatalities of the world the big banks had it took them a while and they did their due diligence and they finally got into crypto towards you know trickled in over the years now the retail trader has sort of the vacuum.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5365,2022-10-21 19:37:56
16960," while, and they did their due diligence, and they finally got into crypto towards trickled in over the years. Now the retail trader has sort of evacuated. And now it's really, there's a much larger influence from your more buttoned up traditional finance firms. And a lot of people- Because of those collaborations or interests, because I wonder, is this akin to like Google when Schmidt came in, right? The adult- Yeah, the adult, right. And I wonder if it's kind of that iteration's kind of same thing. It's the adult in the room phenomenon, I think. And I talked to a professor at Columbia's Business School. He's the head of their Fintech program at Columbia. R.A. Farakina, his name is. And he said, you know, this is not uncommon in technology. You have your early adopters. You remember who the first people we knew, who used the internet were. You know, it was your real tech heavy sort of, you know, you almost had to be a programmer to just navigate the thing. The university system. Or could say academia, right? Yeah, yeah. So we really sort of like a niche early adopter. And then everyone else comes in. The mainstream comes in. And there's a famous book from the early 90s called Crossing the Casm, which kind of describes how that tech evolution happens a lot. You've got your early adopters, sort of your revolutionary, called the misfits, or sort of really bombastic evangelists of the technology. And then eventually it picks up and picks up. And it crosses the chasm into sort of more mainstream. So, you know, a lot of people think that similar thing is happening in crypto. Well, what I also see, what I love in this story is this chart, because I'm an old Wall Streeter. I like to follow the money. The venture capitalists are pulling back on some of their crypto allocations. Right. Absolutely. Down about 37% year over year for the third quarter. And that's part of it, too. You know, you're sort of, you know, in the solid days of crypto, you know, venture capital was flowing freely. They liked that sort of character, that sort of crypto from central casting, revolutionary type of character. Now there's a lot less venture capital. It's there being much more sort of due diligence on it. It's kind of a more grown up phase of the market. I feel like if it's a book, like it's a, I don't know, 50 chapter book, and we're like chapter. Yes. Yeah. That's kind of what it feels like. Mike, we can thank you so much. Mike is senior editor Bloomberg Mark. It's my co-host yesterday on Bloomberg Business Week, right? Was it yesterday? No, was it day before? Yesterday. Sorry. It's that kind of a weak man. I have no idea what day. I had to think about it, too, Colonel. All right. You can read Mike's story and more from Bloomberg. The big take. It's on the Bloomberg terminal at bloomberg.com slash big take. Please don't judge me, but that's why they're going to feed me some wine at the end of the show. Yes, they will. Why not? They will. It's Friday. So that makes sense. We'll have more. But look at this market. It's still moving higher here. So as we head into the close, up 2.4%. All right. Let's get back to world of national news. Nancy Lines is on a DC inance. Thanks, Carol. The Congressional Committee investigating last year's capital attack is officially issuing a subpoena of former president Trump. The panel wants his testimony and relevant documents by the first half of next month. The subpoena was issued on the same day. The judge sentenced former Trump aid, Steve Bannon, to four months in prison for ignoring his subpoena from the same committee. By the administration officials are discussing whether the US should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security reviews. Bloomberg said, Ludlow, with more on why there is concern. Because of the comments that Elon Musk made around the war in Ukraine, because of the threat to be a short-lived one to pull support for the styling system in Ukraine. And because of his deal to buy Twitter, which while it has a small user base has outside societal influence. Bloomberg said, Ludlow says one tool the administration is looking at possibly using is syphias, which looks at acquisitions of US businesses by foreign buyers. Nearly five months after a gunman killed 10 people at a top supermarket in Buffalo, New York, Governor Kathy Hocal announced today a monument will be built in East Buffalo to memorialize the victims.

Carol Master, along with Paul Swini here at Bloomberg headquarters in New York City. And I have to say for the first time, was it this morning? I actually looked at my 401k. Oh, no. But it wasn't as bad as I thought. Okay. You know what I saw was some endowments are starting to report their returns for the year end of June 30th. And they're kind of flut, which is impressive. But you know what I think is happening is they have it marked a market, their private equity investments, which can be like 20, 30 percent of portfolio. So what do they do if you mark it down? When they sell it or what? Periodically. I think you know, periodically, I think I'm not sure exactly, but there's no way because it stock markets down 20 some 100 percent, the fixed income markets down double digits. I'm kind of shocked at that. Hey, so we want to talk a little bit about 401k's or Suzanne Willie. Bloomberg News has a story out on the terminal and it's been a lot of social media momentum to about this news. IRS boosting how much Americans can plow into their 401k plans next year by a record amount amid a surge in inflation. This is another one social security text and 401k apparently. So the numbers are, yeah, the contribution limits for the popular tax deferred retirement savings account will rise by $2,000 to a maximum of $22,500 in 2023. And again, keeping in line with the CPI. It's the biggest dollar increase since the cutoff began being indexed to inflation in 2007 when the maximum amount allowed was $15,500. You and I were talking about this off air because you can also do, there's increase of course for the, you know, for anybody who's trying to catch up contributions if you're 50 or older. So the changes with this new increase by the IRS because of inflation, you're not talking about $30,000 a year that you can plow into your 401k. Yeah, and it's election time. Right. And benefit election time for most employees and players. So it's a good time to kind of make those changes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Exactly, but it's interesting, right? Vanguard reports out there, found the percentage of salary contributed to defined contribution plans such as 401k's last year rose for 42% of plan participants, whether savers elected to increase the amount or they had it boosted automatically by their plan. Yeah, I have my working kids there. There's things like that. There's things like that. Max out your 401k. Trust me, there's not going to be a safety net there for you. I feel like I tell anybody of that, you know, young grades, do it. It is. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5367,2022-10-21 19:46:48

Because the US has a shortage of nurses, hospitals have turned to staffing agencies to fill the gap. Now some lawmakers want to investigate if the rise of so-called travel nurses who work on contract has harmed the health care industry. A better question to ask is why more people aren't entering the field in the first place. One reason is a lack of funds for training. In 2021, US nursing schools turned away more than 90,000 applications because they didn't have enough educators or clinical placement sites. Congress should expand tuition reimbursement for nurses who teach or commit to work in shortage areas. Helping aspiring nurses enter the profession wouldn't just reduce reliance on contractors.

This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. For more Bloomberg opinion, please go to bloomberg.com slash opinion or OP, I and Go on the Bloomberg terminal. This has been Bloomberg Opinion. I'm driving my car. I turn on the radio. Yeah, but you let me drive. Oh, no, no, no. Who's going to drive you home? Honey, please, I'll do the drive. Drive-on. Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question that drives us. This is the drive to the close. That punk community called driver, the Yulge Dawn on Bloomberg Radio. Hi, Kyle. When I started my broadcasting day today at 9 a.m., the 10-year treasury was, the yields were rallying like crazy. We up to 4.33%. We had a big, big turnaround. 10-year now yielding 4.21% driving. I'm hoping to drive this equity market dramatically higher today. Up 2.3%. I really don't know what's going on out there. I think it's just a Fed. We have earnings, but it just feels like it's the Fed. So let's talk to somebody who does this for a living. Lamar Villeurie, partner and portfolio manager at Villeurie and company. They have over 1.5 billion dollars in assets under management. Joining us on the phone from New Orleans. Lamar, I mean, we right smack at the middle of earnings. I'm a fundamental analyst. I'm trying to look at earnings. But at the end of the day, what drives this market, what drives stocks, it feels to me, is just the Fed watch. That's exactly what it is. It's everybody sitting around watching the Fed. And you can look, you guys were just going through naming what's going on with all the indices. They're all up almost exactly about 2.3%. I mean, it's almost moving in perfect lock step. So clearly, it's not driven by an outlier earnings here or there. It's definitely the Fed. And I think, for a while there, everybody was pretty much resigned to both the next two Fed meetings, seeing a 75 basis point hike. And now it's starting to look like, well, the strong dollars causing its own sort of problems. Maybe we see, still more than likely, we see 75 basis points in the November meeting, but for December, it's starting to look like we might see more like 50 or even there's even a small opinion swell creeping up that maybe the Fed pauses entirely in December. So that gives investors hope that maybe these super aggressive moves are going to slow down or even stop within the foreseeable future. And if that's the case, I think you're going to see some more days like today. All right. So let's think, okay, that maybe that happens at the beginning of next year that the Fed stops raising rates and we kind of plateau off when it comes to rates. They're probably not going to yet talk about cuts for a while here. What is the economic impact and how much of a slow down, which then could again start to, depending on how downward it is, start to negatively impact once again the equity universe for sure? Well, it's obviously hard to say the crystal ball can only go out so far on it, but we would say that without the constant, you feel like there's this chopping block every time the Fed meets where it's just going to keep jacking up rates. And as we begin to have some disability and that's stopping, then there's, okay, companies can start to make decisions about investing in projects and reinvesting in catbacks and other things. And people can start thinking about, okay, how much can I really afford? Can I go ahead and buy a house? Do I wait a minute until the rate comes down? I think it just would kind of give everybody I think a sense of confidence that we're out of this Uber hike environment. And potentially, yeah, if we get inflation under control and the economy slows down, potentially you could see some rate cuts next year. So I think everything's on the table, but mostly, I think what we're most excited about is the possibility that this sort of Fed overhang potentially be the end of the site, which would be nice so we can get back to talking about earnings and things that really, we generally hope that we can get rings on each business public because",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5369,2022-10-21 19:55:29
16964," and potentially the end is in sight, which would be nice so we can get back to talking about earnings and the things that really we generally, we're a lot better at forecasting earnings and forecasting what the Fed's gonna do. So, we'll be using that. All right, Carol, are you into the energy drink thing like Red Bull and Monster and all that kind of stuff? No, no, me neither. I'm not, but I know it is a big and growing part of the beverage business. Lamar, you guys like this monster beverage. What's the call there? Sure, so, and funnily enough, there's a fantastic article from the earlier this month in Bloomberg Business Week about bang energy, which is one of their competitors, that there was actually, they were involved in lawsuit with. But basically, monster beverage, these guys are just under 17% owned by Coca-Cola, which is a great benefit, both in terms of the relationship of Coke, but distribution is a huge part of how to compete in this world. In terms of what do you think? It's a $46 billion market cap company. I am blown away, sorry. Yeah, we were stunned by that too. Go ahead, please. Yeah, so their distribution is great, and it's in terms of being concerned about what's going on with the economy, obviously inflation potentially is a problem, but this is, it's caffeine and sorry to say, but it's addictive, and people drink it every day, kind of regardless of what their spare money situation is. So we see, you see these cans and the gas stations, and they fly off the shelves. That's basically a do-oply with Red Bull. It's a great business, great margins, and the company has really been growing, they've expanded into alcoholic beverages, both in craft beer, and then they're launching early next year. This beast unleashed hardselpzer. But this is the people who aren't in Starbucks or in gas stations buying their giant can of monster beverage or their different brands. It's a great business. Hey, what's the deal with on-holding? Ticker is ON-ON. It's down about 56% so far this year. It's about a five point, almost $5.2 billion market cap. I'm not really familiar with them. What's up, and what's the appeal for you? Sure, so you probably have seen them and just not registered. They've got a funky logo, but what's really distinctive about it is they have the sole of the shoes. It's got this foam that's almost got like a Nike air, but completely through. So they're very comfortable. It's more of a fashion than an actual running shoe, although they do have more intense running shoes. But this is a company that actually swifts, but it's a huge, huge growth story. Their sales in North America basically doubled in the second quarter. Their margins are improving. It's a really impressive business. This is kind of the opposite consumer of Monster Beverage. The Monster Beverage guys got a pocket full of corners that he's plunking down for his giant can of energy drink. On-holding is more of a high end. These are like $150, $175 shoes. There's a lot of competition in that space. That's right. There is, but we think these guys they're growing very quickly. And they're just now getting into the apparel market, which we think they're going to have some real luck in. Hey, Lamar, I mean, Vilarion Company founded in 1911. Are you kidding me? Not by me. I'm not quite that old yet. But you're the fourth generation? That's right. That's right. It's awesome. It's a company that's founded by our great grandfather. That is just fantastic. All right, well, don't blow it. I mean, you're the fourth generation there. We'll do our best. Thank you. Listen, that's great stuff. Lamar, we really appreciate you taking time. I love talking stocks every once in a while. I'll pick you up. Thank you. How about that? Markets up 2.3% just about the close here. Lamar, Vilarion, partner and portfolio manager at Vilarion Company, over $1.5 billion in assets on the management. Management founded in 1911. Now the fourth generation family owned very cool. So Lamar was on the phone from New Orleans and talking stocks. Yes, some strong gains for stocks over all this week. All right, right now, folks, we're going to head over to our TV colleagues beyond the bell on radio TV and YouTube. We're counting you down to the close.

Romain Bostek, Caroline Hyde, count you down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our global simulcast. And we're joined right now by Carol A. Maser and Paul T. Sweeney and for Tim Stenevich, we welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio and on YouTube Departs, a wild week of trading. What about me, Carol? I don't know. I don't know. You're a mystery girl, black box. C-S-K. S-K, that rolls off the time. Wait, wait, so Romain, what's your middle name? R. You'll never get his middle name out of him. We need messages Mother One Day. Sounds for Ravishing. We'll work on that, ain't it? Ravishing? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to disagree with you. This market is ravishing. If you're trying to be a bull in this market, in fact, some pretty strong gains, and we check it out, it's almost like the same kind of percentage gains for each of those major equity averages, Paul, we're just rolling off our best levels of the session. Yeah, that was a good, good close to the week. We also saw some good volume out there. So if you're looking for some confirmation of moves in the market, both on the upside and the downside, one of the ways is to take a look at the volume. We had volume about 15%, 16% better than the recent averages. So again, big buying on a big update. And of course, this is a big options day, where we get to see that volume, we get to see that volatility. And boy, did we see it, not just in the stock market, but really the volatility came, leaps and bounds, once again, from the FX market, out from the bond market. Yeah, and for the bomber, I mean, the moves that we saw, particularly on the five-year year, today, kind of flipping from positive into negative. And just the broad base nature of that swing really tells you that a lot of folks don't, we're not necessarily aware of the market is headed. But a lot of people are willing to put some money to work to sort of make a bet on where they think it might actually go. Closing bells here in New York, 31,000, and change right now on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, higher by more than 700 points or about 2.5%. It's basically a similar story right now for all of the major indices. The S&P 500, up 2.4, the NASDAQ, up about 2.3, and the Russell 2000, Carol, higher by about 2.2%. Yeah, so we just, two in the dollar, we're seeing the dollar index just down, just a tad, about 9.10 of a percent. So you do wonder how that is also playing into what people are thinking about interest rates, longer term, and what it means for the dollar Caroline. Yeah, and let's have a little look from a more broad industry-wide perspective, because it was a risk on flavor to the day. It wasn't everything industry group higher, even though, of course, we were in a risk off territory. At the beginning of trade, BOJ seemed to change all of that. And notably, it was your chip stocks, getting some relief here at the moment. Finally, flooding back into the market at the moment. We're seeing the semis up 3.5% auto is doing well on the day as well. Tesla was in the green. Notable though, as you said, materials have been driving high throughout the day. The banks also managed to outperform. Basically, every single industry group was in the green, all VAR1, have to look to the telecommunication services area. So a little bit of IT spend there is the key concern. A little bit of the communication services, telecom services is sort of what the old term of phrase might be. When you look at the metals, we're also when you look at Verizon with its numbers, Carl. Remain Roland, Ralph, Brotherford, Rex. No. All right, I'm going to keep guessing. All right, let's get to some of the individual gainers in today's session, a standout by a mile. In fact, top in the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500, we're talking about Moderna, continuing to charge ahead, up another 8.5% in today's trade, Moderna and other COVID-19 vaccine makers, rallying as an SVB analyst came out, upgraded Moderna to market perform from underperform, and said Pfizer's comments earlier this week signals, quote, meaningful, higher than expected pricing for its COVID-19 vaccine, which is a positive sign for Moderna. And I thought they used, I thought it was interesting how the analyst used it, we're doopily, a potential doopily in the space, based on referring to Moderna and Pfizer. They've got it, right? The price target, by the way, Moderna raised to 101, stock closing at 128 and change. Schlumberger, or Schlumberger, whichever you want to say, at more than 10%, I know, I'm just having a little fun. Top of the S&T P500, hitting a high, I think the highest in several years, we know that the world's biggest oil services provider, they soared after posting their best profit in seven years and raising guidance for the rest of 2022. That stock up almost 70% for the year overall. We know the energy outperformance. Got a mention Netflix, we broke them down earlier this week. It was up another 8% today. Didn't see any real big news, but guys, this stock is up about 23% Paul for the week overall, so big momentum to the upside for that one. Yeah, good, good, good earnings coming out. I don't know, good guidance, and that's what it took. All right, you've got some of the decliner set up. There's a hard to find out there in an up 2.4% day on the market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5371,2022-10-21 20:04:08
16966," side for that one. Yeah, good, good earnings coming out of the good guidance and that's what it took. All right, you've got some of the decliner set up. There's a hard to find out there in up 2.4% day on the market, but you have to look no further than some of the social media names led by SNAP, SNAP chat. That was down 28% today, real disappointing numbers, disappointing guidance. That took down some of the other social media names out there like Twitter, like Meta, and the real issue here is advertising demand. If we are in fact either in a recession or going into a recession, historically that does not bode well for advertising. I don't care whether you're selling an ad on radio, TV or on a digital platform, you will have some headwinds, advertisers can and do cut back on some of their ad budgets. So that's a concern across the space. We saw that with SNAP's numbers today. And of course, Twitter, having its own idiosyncratic, will he, Elon Musk, get the go ahead from CIFIUS as well? That great scoop coming from Brunemberg a little bit earlier. I'm looking at what's happening from a GMM Global Macron Movers perspective pool. And for our radio audience, today was a day of FX volatility. Today was a day where the Moon music shifted all around 10th, 30 AM when we suddenly see some significant buying in the Japanese yen. Who other? Well, the Nikkei is reporting it was the overall institutions over in Japan, propping up, intervening, deciding that this one-way street of Japanese weakness was going to be no more. So we're going to see the US$1,500 higher. We see strengthening 1.7% as we did indeed break that 150 level quite a clip earlier today. The question mark is how much longer can they support when we just see such a differential in borrowing costs between Japan and the US. We're seeing the Aussie dollar lift higher. We see strength in the Kiwi as well. All because we're seeing a weakening dollar index, which in large part was on the move of the BOJ and maybe in some part with some pound strength as well. Commodities, much again, you've been putting out time and time again remain. The weakness in natural gas prices. You see it in Europe. We see it in the US finally, that inflationary pressure coming off the boil a little bit at least. I have a question in Caroline. You said, CSK? What is that stand for? That's not high. Caroline Sarah K. Oh, it's SK. So you have two middle notes. Yeah. I'm too special. I'm that special. I'm that British that I need to have proof of. I needed a hedge there bets to get all their favourite names in there. I'm looking at also what's happening with Brent Crude at 1.3% as we see. Maybe some optimism again. Are we going to get any optimism around the Chinese overall global growth story? Some of our bonds. Look at that 30-year debt in Japan. Yields per shy. Well, we're coming back here to the US and you talk about what's been going on in the Treasury market. It was incredibly volatile week here. It may be a little bit up, a little bit down, depending on what part of the curve you're looking at here. But on a weekly basis, you're talking about six straight weeks now that we've seen gains on that two-year yield now camped out right around 4.5% or so. And then you talk about the 10-year yield. 4.2% and more importantly here, this is now the 12th straight week that we've seen a jumping yield. Basically down in price, higher in yields. That's basically ties us for the longest stretch on record. You actually have to go back right now to 1984. That was basically the Paul Voker era when he was raising rates here. The last time we saw a 12-week stretch, a 12-week sell-off like this in the 10-year, if we hit 13 weeks tomorrow, 13 weeks, that's basically going to be the longest losing streak on 10-year treasury prices that we've seen since records have been kept going back to the 1960s. And guys, I think that gives us sort of a clear indication here. Not only of the severity of the bond sell-off, but more importantly, it raises the question and I think it's been brought up today by the Mary Daly's, the Charles Evans of the World, even Leo Brandert last week. This idea of maybe we have reached, if not the peak, gotten somewhere close to that peak in yields. I got to say, I just feel like the Fed narrative has changed all of a sudden very quickly in terms of this idea that maybe the Fed is getting to the end of its raising rate cycle at this point and then going to kind of top out for a while. And I feel like that's different from what we were talking about maybe a couple of weeks ago, Paul. Yeah, I think so. And we are focused on the Fed. We do a very good job focusing on the Fed, but we're also in the middle of earnings season. And next week for the tech. I like the Fed. Good, good. Exactly, but for the tech folks who follow on those tech stocks, as a leader in this market, we're getting a lot of names next week, Microsoft and all the others starting to report next week. Which one is most important to you? That you're looking at what you think will be better. A couple of ones I like are Amazon and Microsoft. Microsoft goes to both the consumer and the corporate client in terms of buying software. And Amazon obviously goes to the cloud as well, but it also goes to the consumer and their trends. Are they buying as many as much stuff as they were before or is it slowing down? Can we come up with that?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5372,2022-10-21 20:08:34
16967," Where an Amazon obviously goes to the cloud as well, but it also goes to the consumer and their trends. Are they buying as many as much stuff as they were before or is it slowing down? So those are two names to really focus on. And that was also interesting. We had a great conversation with John Edwards a little bit earlier about what the detailed data is currently showing us. And there was some great analysis done that shows where people are pulling back in the face of inflation. The face of war is about a recession. Restaurants they pull back from travel, they pull back from at the moment if you're looking at the certain temperature, the 16th and 20th is when the survey data was taken. But not in the realm of e-commerce. And I wonder if that really does help out in Amazon. I thought that was interesting too. And that'll probably be a key part of the story. Of course we know Amazon is a try to not necessarily move away, but definitely diversify away from that. So we'll see whether Amazon Web Services and some of those other areas maybe helps to account for that. I did just want to point out real quick too. Because this is still a global macro story as we saw in that chart. I forgot all about the ECB on Thursday making a decision. People think they're going to come with 75 basis points. And of course after the rumor yen intervention that we got today, that BOJ meeting at the end of next week, is certainly going to be much more in focus than it would have been. I follow the work of Gina Martin Adams very closely at Bloomberg Intelligence. And she says, hey, continue to focus on the profit margins out there across corporate America here. Obviously the inflationary pressures hitting a lot of businesses across the board and also watch for the FX headwinds as well. It's red, isn't it? Remain, red, positive. It's Romeo. Romeo. Is it? Maybe. All right. You'll make it up. To be continued, all right guys, have a good weekend. All right, that's a wrap for our cross platform coverage on radio TV and YouTube. We call it Beyond the Bell. We will see you same time, same place on Monday. You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. All right, yes indeed everybody. It's going to be a crazy week next week. Yeah, I was just saw the graphic up on the Bloomberg television all the earnings next week and then it's Remain pointed out the ECB as well. So this is it. We're going to think of earnings season and looking for some guidance about, you know, where this economy is going. Is there a recession out there? How deep it's also good to talk to and then listen to a lot of these CEOs and CFOs as they talk about their business and what their customers are telling them. Yeah, right. And you throw that against what we're hearing from all the Fed speakers, you know, which we've gotten so many from and you'll get a good idea of maybe where we go from here. But keep in mind, it's Boeing also exon, the energy guys biogen. So we really get a nice cross sampling of certainly the global economy closing a week from today. I don't know. Do you think we get it? Maybe you pay prime minister before we get that. Good point. Good point. Well, reference point. Let's get back to world of national news off to DC. We go and Nancy Lyons. Hey, Nancy. Hey, Carol, the House Committee investigating January 6th, this issue to subpoena to former president Trump requiring him to turn over all requested documents by November 4th and appear for a deposition of November 14th. Lawmakers say Trump was the central cause of a coordinated multi-part effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. It is expected this will lead to a protracted court fight on whether a former president can be forced to answer questions from lawmakers that might relate to a criminal probe. Well, word of the subpoena comes on the day when former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was sentenced to four months in prison for defying his subpoena from the January 6th committee. The judge is allowing Bannon to stay free pending appeal and is also imposing a fine of $6,500 as part of the sentence. I respect the judge. The sense he came down with today is his decision. I fully respect him and totally respectful of his entire process on the legal side. And says he will appeal.

16968," Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take powered by more than 2700 journalist and analysts and more than 120 countries. All right, Nancy. Thank you so much. Carol Maser along with Paul Swini. Hey, I did want to mention a headline that crossed Mattel agreeing to pay three and a half million to settle some charges. This has to do with, I guess, financial misstatements. So again, understand the tax related valuation allowance for the third quarter of 2017 by about 109 million and overstayed the tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 by the same amount. So that did cross why we're getting towards the closing bell there just right after. Annex. Yes. This one got my attention. American Express slumped the most in four months after it set aside more for bad loans and analysts had expected. Stressing rising interest rates could start crimping customers' ability to pay their bills. The reason it surprised me. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. I wouldn't expect to see it somewhere else in the credit community, not necessarily in America. America is our master card. Exactly. You think of American Express maybe a little bit more, you know, affable customer base, but no, they're seeing it. And that kind of follows on some news we heard earlier in the week from our life financial, the old General Motors financing arm, where they called that issue out as well. That is there starting to see some more delinquencies and some more charge off so that, you know, that consumer on the margin here, we're starting to see it. You know, Vincent Rell has talked about this a lot from our global macro squawk desk. And you know, that increasingly, you know, watching those consumer credit numbers and that, you know, individuals who had a lot of money during the pandemic, right? Because of some of the benefits we got from the government that their bank accounts were healthier than they had been in a long time, but that they've used all of that up and that increasingly you're seeing, you know, consumers really spend on credit and that could be troublesome. That's right. That's right. Because remember when we came out of the pandemic, everybody was, or when we were in the pandemic, everybody was just flush with cash. Right. Because they were really spending money. They had the steaming checks. And cash was building up and now we're starting to see that bleed off. Yeah, exactly. And it's interesting. Carolyn Hyde did talk with the AMX CEO and he says a big thing for us is when we start to lose white color jobs. It's less about inflation a little more about jobs and they grew last month. That's one of the things he's watching. And he did say we have a bifurcated economy right now. We don't have job losses right now. And they cut it. That's the tough thing right now. That's if you want to make a recession call, it's tough to make right now given the labor market. All right. You're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week right here on Bloomberg Radio. Now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5374,2022-10-21 20:16:57

16970," about technology today. And we're being told, we're to be in this mindset of fearing technology, fearing all the risks and the wrongs of algorithmic decision making and AI. And this book is much more about the potential, the opportunity, not denying the risk, actually understanding what are these risks that we are really fearing, is it that AI is too good? It's too bad, it's not confident enough. And really being much more nuanced and taking kind of agency over the technology that we use. So, you know, Orley, I hear tech folks in general talk about AI all the time. Can you define for me what you really believe artificial intelligence is and how do you think the Apple, how it should be applied in this economy in broader technology? Yeah, so you write that AI has a lot of definitions and it's pretty broad. It's broadly defined as any automated process that replaces in some way human function. So cognition or an even emotion are decision making processes. So algorithms that replace human decision making and helping us with computational powers that we don't have. And so on your question of, you know, how should we use it? Really can use it to leverage, you know, everything that we're trying to do, like more accurate, more precise, less biased decision making, whether it's in hiring or in health, helping find cures sort, you know, through diagnostics, through screening, making financial decisions. It really using it as a tool to think about our own fallibility and our own limitations and kind of moving to the next step of decision making. You know, I love how you start the book and you do talk about your own daughters. And when we think about it, technology can be life saving today and a godsend in terms of what it can do. And I even, as much as I sometimes hate my phone, I'm amazed at what it can do for me and expedite certain processes and so on and staying in touch, it's just pretty amazing via Zoom, pretty remarkable, but it can lead to problems. How do we need to make sure that we have a pure, more productive, more equal road as a result of technology going forward? Like, what are the things we need to think about and do? And be active about it. So I do make it very personal. I feel like this will be personal for you. Not falling into the ocean. Are you there? No, I'm just for those watching on YouTube. I'm plugging my laptop here. Just kidding, just kidding, go ahead. I think that technology is personal to each and every one of us. So I really start the book with the life saving technology that my middle daughter, as I described her, my bionic daughter wears with type 1 diabetes, a closed loop, insulin pomp and CGM continuous glucose monitor that makes its own decisions that again are much more precise about when to bolus for food, for sugar levels, than we've ever been able to do as humans. And so we need to think about all these opportunities and the ways that it's helping us. But yes, acknowledge the risk of when are we too trusting? When are we under trusting technology? What are the uses? So actually, I have this argument that I really feel strongly that we've been privileging privacy and this fear of data extraction. And in the media, there's a lot of this. It's all about surveillance and companies and government are looking at our personal information. And what my call is in the quality machine is that we need to think about the uses of information. And a lot of times having more information is actually wonderful. It's what brings innovation. It's what brings more rationality. It corrects all kinds of inequities and long standing harms.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5376,2022-10-21 20:25:33
16971," More rationality, it was corrects all kinds of inequities and long standing harms. So another example is in the field of gender gaps, pay gaps, inequities and salaries and racial and gender inequities. And it's an area that I've researched for a long time. And I show that we have this taboo, I've always had it about sharing our, you know, information and salary, right, and we're told that, you know, we don't want anybody to know. And companies actually benefit from that, from having that secrecy. And nowadays with platforms, right, like LinkedIn and there's an app that's called Know Your Words, that actually is the big drive of equality that we actually can know our words. Orally we got to run, but hopefully we can continue on this conversation in the future, because it's certainly something that's going to stick around for a while, no doubt.

That is just beautiful poetry all right Charlie Pellet we love you Charlie Pellet there with a Bloomberg business news flash well we do have a great segment to wrap up the day and the wild week that was we're talking wine which we like to do from time to time in our next guest we're focusing on was named the company for the Babylonian goddess of wine Seduri absolutely pleasure to be here well it's so great it's family owned began back in the early 1990s love of Pinot noir and so that voice you just heard is Matt Revlett he's one maker for Seduri wines and lucky for us he's joining Paul and myself here in our studio is how are you cheers great it's a beautiful day here in New York the market was actually up we have wine in the studio nothing really beautiful day so pleasure to be here thank you for having me well tell us a little bit about your business and how you came to be with them of course so Seduri wines named after the Babylonian goddess of wine which in the epic of Gilgamesh had an ale house at the edge of the world which I've just exhausted all of my epic of Gilgamesh stories with that sentence but what we do is we source Piano War from up and down the west coast as far south as Santa Barbara County and as far north as the William Et Valle in Oregon so it's about a thousand miles stretch so I came to find Seduri gosh I got into wine making being from Kentucky actually working on a vineyard during the summers as a summer job basically driving in post things of urban it is bourbon country yes I got distracted but I eventually fell in love with wine making through those avenues of course I graduated in08 during the recession with a philosophy degree which presented another unique set of challenges yes it did it did and one of those thoughts was why not take a chance it's a good time for it I found an internship at a winery in Sonoma County California and it just took off from there and eventually found Seduri when I found the founder Adam Lee was looking for somebody to take the reins and thought that'd be a lot of fun and it certainly is all right what's it talk to us I like to ask business owners people that really have feet on the ground what's what's your business been like over the last two and a half three things have been good of course covid presented a unique set of challenges to us all but but things have been good things are steady you know of course there's some you know restaurant accounts retail accounts some switching back and forth with who's open who's closed right but things have been really good and we've had we've had some nice harvest on the heels of them well and like no I I spend a lot of time in northern California and I know the wildfire issue effects everybody it's almost no one is immune and I know you're part of the world and that region of the state has really been impacted give us some kind of some your experiences it does it's it's challenging and you know it's it's difficult because there's also a human element so I mean we went to expose people to danger smoke from wildfires things of that nature and of course it's very difficult to make wine when you're under evacuation orders from the winery there are challenges climate change is definitely a real thing we're seeing it more every year but it makes us more and more grateful for when we don't have those challenges and wildfires and 2022 is absolutely fantastic.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5379,2022-10-21 20:38:43
16974," Hopefully a real thing. We're seeing it more every year. But it makes us more and more grateful for when we don't have those challenges and wildfires. And 2022 is absolutely fantastic. It was a good year. What if there's one thing that climate change has caused you to change in terms of either strategy or how you develop and cultivate wine, what is it? Sure. So we're looking into farming methods called regenerative agriculture, basically. Hearing more and more of that. Long-term trials to eventually make vineyards carbon sinks. So fewer disking passes. We'll wait to hit that again. Disking. What is that? Basically taking a tractor through and plowing the soil. So eventually you might lose lots of topsoil, erosion, things of that nature. So we want to have less inputs in the vineyard and actually eventually have them be carbon sinks. All right. So is that something that the industry braces or is it something that maybe you have some old fashion wine makers that, no, I'm doing the way we've done it forever? There's some of both, but it takes a few brave folks to really lead the way on that. And we're happy to be part of leading the charge on that. So we're very, very happy. So when you look at, and we've got about 40 seconds, then we're going to take a break and come back and drink some wine and actually talk some more. But when you think about your customer base, who is it that you guys are going after? There's so much wine and wineries out there. Absolutely. So we'd like to think that we can make peanut and wires an affordable price to where you don't have to be an expert. And you do have a nice price point. Of course. Yeah. So we're going to retail price 30 to $40 on most of our products. And we do offer a slew of vineyard designate series wines, which we retail for $70. Lot smaller production on those and a lot more geeky wines, I guess you could say. All right. So we're going to taste what you're laughing over this? Yes, I think you want to like it. Do you like geeky wines? Yes. I might. You like peanut and more, right? Sure. I do. We're going to sample some peanut and more. And we're going to talk about Charne, right? Because you guys have a million to none too. And we're going to continue to talk with Matt Revolette. He is one maker at Seduri Wines. As you heard, up and down the west coast, and we'll get more into what their business is doing. And we'll talk about the wines we're going to be drinking. In the meantime, we got to get back to world and national news. Lots going on around the globe. Nancy Lines is on it. She is in our DC newsroom. No wine here. Sorry. That's OK. Well, the House Committee investigating last year's attack on the Capitol issued a subpoena to Donald Trump today demanding the former president account for his actions under oath and initiating a legal showdown. Bloomberg's Joe Matthew with more. This is the result of the committee's vote in its final hearing held just over a week ago. Mr. Chairman, on this vote, there are nine eyes and zero nose. The resolution is agreed to. The subpoena directs Trump to provide documents by November 4th and testimony beginning November 14th. For however many days it takes again. Bloomberg's Joe Matthew host of Bloomberg Sound On, which you can hear at the top of the hour on Bloomberg Radio. Trump's subpoena comes on the day that Trump's long term advisor, Steve Bannon, was sentenced to four months in prison in 65 received a $6,500 fine for refusing to comply with the subpoena from the same House Committee. David Shone is Bannon's attorney. We will be filing a notice of appeal as the judge indicated. Very grateful to the judge for thinking through the issues candidly. Shone believes the appeal and the case is bulletproof. President Biden is making the case for his handling of the economy. Today, my administration announced that this year, the deficits fell by $1.4 trillion. The largest one-year job in American history, $1.4 trillion declined in the deficit. I repeat that, the largest ever decline in the federal deficit. Biden says under his predecessor, the deficit went up every single year.

16976," 5 music This is a Bloomberg Business Flash. From Bloomberg World Hanquaters, I'm Charlie Pellet. We begin with the developing story on this Friday, the outlook for the UK's credit score has been revised to negative by Moody's investor service, which sites factors, including increased unpredictability in fautilcy making. Stocks higher cross aboard Big Rally for the US Stock Market today, let's begin with a look at the weekly numbers because for the week, the S&P 500 index was up 4.7%, bringing its year to date loss to 21.2% today. S&P up 87 points up 2.4% the Dow today, up 749 points up 2.5% and as stack up 244 points up by 2.3%. So another day of Big Riversals stocks notching their best weeks since June after a treasury round sputtered today, the 10 year yielding 4.22% 2 year, 4.47% spot gold of 1.7% 16.56 ounce West Texas in the media crude up 8.10% of 1% today, WTI at 85.17%. I'm Charlie Pellet, that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Alright, Charlie Pellet. Thank you so much. We appreciate it. Alright, it is a Friday. It is painfully close to 5 p.m. I think it's time to open a couple bottles of wine. You can do that. We can do that. Matt Revollette, wine maker for Ceduri wines, joining us here in a Bloomberg Interact or broker studio and he did not come empty handed. Matt, tell us about the wines. There we go. Sure, so the wines that you brought with you today. Absolutely, so the first one we have is one of ours. That looks good. That's one of my favorite sounds. Okay. I'm going to pass this. Can I guess two? Of course. Thank you. Thank you. What I brought is a vineyard desert peanut noir from Gary's Vineyard and the St. O'Cee Highlands, so Monterey County. A very cold, very windy place to grow peanut noir. Gary's is a farming team of two friends, both named Gary, that have been farming in the St. O'Cee Highlands. Great to see you. I'm serious. I love that. I love that. Childhood best friends as well. Great story. So, lucky to be sourcing grapes from this vineyard. It tends to be a pretty robust peanut noir. The fruit holds its acid really well. The grain in our studio, all of a sudden. Yeah. So, if you like a full-bodied, kind of rich ripe style, this is right up your alley. Who is, it looks beautiful. I mean, Desilek-Piatafaults. What? Explain to me that designate business, like versus your grapes versus somebody else's grapes is that how? Sure. It's basically just a closer look of doing one vineyard only. What does this one vineyard do in bottle? So we do vineyard designated wines, but we also do larger what we call Appalachian Blins that encounter.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5382,2022-10-21 20:51:58
16977," one vineyard only. What does this one vineyard do in bottle? So we do vineyard designated wines, but we also do larger what we call Appalachian blends that encompass several vineyards. So this is just kind of a micro look at what one vineyard can do in one vineyard. Well, and I was freaking like on the website, you guys talk about minimal intervention in the wine making process. Talk to us about what that means and maybe how that distinguishes you from some other vineyards. Absolutely. So peanut noir is what we call a wine growers grape. It doesn't really like high touch in the winery. If you get the farming right, if you get a good vintage, if you pick on the right date, it's pretty minimal intervention. So a couple of punch downs to keep the cap wet. Then you go to barrel and that's pretty much it. So it doesn't like having a lot of finger prints on it. And the vineyard's really shine with minimal intervention in the winery. We kind of make them all the same and keep our hands off. Carol opened a twist cap versus a cork. You know, there was a day when we ended off by like, what exactly put to rest or give us your opinion on that. So yes, I do have opinions. So Seddury was one of the early adopters of the screw cap. Oh my god. This is very nice. Nice legs. Glad you enjoy it. So with the screw cap, we transition 0708. After years and years of trials, we found the wines age better. They age more consistently. There's really no bottle to bottle variation. And you don't ever end up with cork tank or TCA. So it ensures that our customers get the product and the form that we intended it to get to them. That's interesting. And it doesn't, so you see it as a plus, obviously, right? Absolutely. Is there still a hard sell in the marketplace? Yes. It's soon. We're starting to see a lot of that change. There are the diehards. There's a lot of great wine traditions. I don't think all of them are completely necessary, at least in our eyes. And corks is one of those. So it just helps our customers get the wine in the best possible form. What they ask you about labor, because when I think about, again, I spend a lot of time in the central valley, right around Carmell Monterrey. Talk. I'll just talk a lot. Cheers. I see, you know, for various types of agriculture, just armies and armies and artists of people, talk to us about in your business labor. Yeah. Sure. So labor is tight. I think a lot of regions that have are heavily tourism-based, Napa, Snaman, North Bay, housing is certainly an issue. Yeah. The housing costs are very expensive. So it's something we're cognizant of. We're lucky to have really talented teams out in the field for us. Really good leadership as well. But yeah, it seems to be a pinch point in a lot of ways, and it's been going on for quite some time. So does that mean, like just following on what Paul said, does it mean that sometimes you can't get the workers you need or want? No, we don't really have an issue keeping our teams together. There are some horror stories about people getting paid a dollar more and then leaving that day when they're supposed to go big grapes, or something like that. Fortunately, we have not found ourselves in those situations. What's the, you know, Carmell's mentioning that it just seems like there's so many wine labels out there. What is the competitive landscape? Like, do you just try to find a little niche and then really excel or do you try to take on some of the bigger? You know, it's really just a little bit about connecting with people over our wines, sharing the stories, you know, relating to them and being accessible to the last thing I would want to do is for have Cedurri wines to be inaccessible. So that's why we make our kind of our lower priced entry-level wines. If you're curious about Pinot noir or Chardonnay, we source from so many different areas, Oregon, down through the central coast of California, down to Santa Barbara, that we think we might find something you like. Matt, you know, it's interesting that you say that I feel like we're talking with Matt Revlett, wine maker of Cedurri wines here in our studio. I do feel like over the last couple of years, I feel like there is a theme of people saying, listen, you don't have to spend a ton of money for a great bottle of wine. And I find it too that I, you know, I've got those that I love and a little bit pricier, but I'll go in and I can find some great wines at great price points. And there's something that's happened in the industry where that's a good thing and an acceptable thing. You don't have to shell out a thing. Yeah. So I think, you know, something to be said about that is that we're getting better at it. We're figuring out our places more. We're figuring about where to plant certain grapes a little bit better. It takes a long time to really figure out if something is going to work, vineyard wise, it goes into the ground and it really takes 10 years to figure out what's going on through vine health, vine age and vintage variation. So I think we're all getting better at it. So that helps with the price point, right? Absolutely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5383,2022-10-21 20:56:03
16978," ground and it really takes 10 years to figure out what's going on through vine health, vine age, and vintage variation. So I think we're all getting better at it. So that helps with the price point, right? Absolutely. That's different. How's the wine industry doing relative to other spirits or beer and that type of thing? Are people drinking more wine, less wine? People are still drinking a lot of wine. What are you doing, Paul? Definitely, we drink peanut and no more, almost all the time. Absolutely. So you're a target market. So thank you. You're welcome. During the pandemic, I heard from word of mouth that people may have been drinking a little bit more. Yes, yes, yours truly might have been included. But yeah, there was a lot of stocking up from retail outlets. So we saw some of the channels shift, of course, with restaurants being closed. There was a lot more of what we call off premise accounts and a lot of activity there. So things shifted, but still stayed really steady for us. I've even heard by restaurants that didn't come back and still haven't come back or you're okay. We're okay. It's tough seeing our friends in the restaurant and business in the situation that they are in and slash have been in for quite some time. So yeah, that's painful for us too because they're our partners. All right, we are Bloomberg. I mean, I have to ask this. Don't don't don't everybody roll your eyes. Recession, no recession. Are you worried a little bit about the outlook? I am cautiously optimistic. So Chris, you have a glass of wine. Yeah, yeah, and it's Friday afternoon and it's a beautiful day in New York. So cautiously optimistic. I gotta say, does feel like things are moving forward. I mean, we've had more guests in studio than in a long, long time. I'm really just in the last couple of weeks. So Matt, what a treat. What a pleasure. You've got the Chardonnay, you've got the Pinot noir, and the Chardonnay is kind of new, right? Oh, yes. So Sardirri has traditionally been all Pinot noir.

16979," Music... From the heart of innovation, money and power. I'm Emily Chagantier, Francisco, and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up in the next hour. The annual security reviews for Elon Musk's various ventures from Twitter to Tesla, this after his Russia Ukraine tweets, especially given Tesla's strong presence in China and AI development. Plus, the White House may, but more restrictions on China technology from AI to quantum computing. And Apple's design chief, who replaced Johnny Ive, is leaving the company, according to Bloomberg sources, how she implanted the product line up and what it means for iPhones, iPads and the incoming mixed reality headset. All of that in a moment, but first let's get straight to the markets with Bloomberg's at Bloodlow. And Ed, we made it. Happy Friday. Yeah, happy Friday. And it was a happy Friday in the market. It's a lot of green on the screen. In a week where, let's be honest, there was a lot of anxiety, right? Disasterous results from Snap, a really precipitous plunge. Tesla missing top line for the first time since the third quarter of last year. Fed speak, Fed speak, Fed speak, lots of anxiety around higher rates. And throughout the course of the week, yields on all end of the curve pushing higher. And yet, we really rally hard on Friday across the S&P 500, but also tech in particular, Nasak 100, in line with that performance. And semi-conductors really outperforming five straight days of gains, best streak since November 2021. We're going to dig into that later in the show. So let's look at how the week looks. I mean, for the S&P 500, the Nasak 100, these were the best weeks since June. There was weakness. Chinese, U.S. listed Chinese tech stocks, not performing well. We see that in the Golden Dragon Index. And all told, we're still bracing. I know you and I are going to discuss this later in the show, M. Next week is pivotal for big tech. We're hearing a lot about a stronger dollar. We're hearing about weakness in the ad market. And now we're hearing a lot of jitters around Elon Musk. Twitter. It was the story of the week. It's always the story of the week at the moment. But at one point, the stock dropping precipitously and then pairing losses. And I think it's important to state the White House issuing a statement saying they're not aware of any security reviews of Elon Musk or Elon Musk's businesses. That kind of settled things a little bit in terms of the movement on the stock. But the spreads continue to creep, right? We're waiting for this to be done. October 28th at 5pm is the deadline. Bloomberg reporting, according to sources, the bankers on both sides, the advisors. They are working diligently to get this done. So this report from Bloomberg about security reviews, reviews, kind of came out of left field. This was something we were not prepared for. But it happened and you've got the details. Yes, indeed. We're going to talk about that a little bit more right now. Thank you. Biden administration.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5385,2022-10-21 21:04:50
16980," We're not prepared for, but it happened, and you've got the details. Yes, indeed. We're going to talk about that a little bit more right now, Ed. Thank you. Biden administration officials are debating whether the U.S. should subject some of Elon Musk's ventures to national security review, this, according to Bloomberg sources. This would include the Twitter deal, Tesla, SpaceX's Starlink Network, and U.S. officials are uncomfortable with what they see as Musk's increasingly Russia-friendly stance and his plans to buy Twitter with the help of foreign investors. For more on this, I want to bring in Bloomberg's Dan Flatney and Sarah Fryder. So Dan, let's start with you. Tell us what we know at this point about this potential series of national security reviews. Right. So I think that in many respects, the reviews are centering on Twitter, and on the consortium of investors that Musk has lined up to help in his acquisition of the company if that is what ends up happening at the end of the day. And those investors, some of which are based overseas, because of the the make up of that consortium, there is a potential for the committee on foreign investment in the United States to get involved in looking at the interests there. Now, the question is sort of twofold at that point. And one is whether the committee actually has jurisdiction, which sort of has to do not just with the financial stakes that these investors are looking at, but whether they'll have any controlling interest in Twitter, whether they'll be on the board, whether they'll have access to non-public information, things of that nature. And that will be sort of in the deal. So CIFIUS does have the ability to potentially ask Musk or ask the those involved in the deal for more information on that end. And then it sort of becomes a policy decision for the Biden administration to make as to whether they would want to step in and stop that deal or potentially more likely have some revisions or some mitigation effects on that. At this point, it seems somewhat unlikely that that's the course that they will take, but there is some interest in perhaps trimming Musk's sales a little bit in terms of his rhetoric out there, what he's saying publicly. And some potential risks with foreign investment in some of his companies. Sarah, were a week away from the day that this deal is supposed to close? How big a wrench is this in that schedule? Well, Emily, we have been on this show talking about the fact that he's on the wanted to buy Twitter and then he didn't want to buy Twitter and then he wanted to again, but there were some some stipulations that Twitter didn't want. And just back and forth, all the legal filings, all the subpoenas. Finally, we're reporting that that talks are cordial that they're all on track to get this deal done by October 28. And if the Biden administration is the wrench that falls in its way, that would just be such a perfect climax of the story. It's really, it's really been a bumpy ride for the company and for Elon Musk here and for us reporters at Bloomberg as well. But listen, you know, it's hard, it's hard to say until they actually say they're going to do a review, whether this is going to delay anything as far as the folks involved in the deal are operating. They are, they are on track to meet the judges deadline, which is 5 p.m. Eastern time next Friday. If they don't meet that deadline for whatever reason, you know, it could end up going to court. So I think that they're pretty head down on that. However, you know, Sifi's reviews could come still. And I think that they would have to respond to that, whatever it ends up being. Dan, in your reporting, you talk also about the Russia Ukraine tweets, Elon Musk's threat to cut off Starlink access to Ukraine. How much are officials really concerned about this? A potentially Russia friendly stance from Elon Musk? I think that there's a couple of things that they're looking at there. Certainly there is the rhetoric that Musk and others have engaged in on this issue. In addition to that, I think that there is the Starlink issue, the satellite communications network that Musk has helped set up in Ukraine and is looking to the answer back in the 18th of May.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5386,2022-10-21 21:09:08
16981," to. In addition to that, I think that there is the star link issue, the satellite communications network that Musk has helped set up in Ukraine and is looking to set up in Iran as well. And I think that there is some concern from defense officials and from those in the administration that giving one private individual and a private company so much control over the kinds of communication and the ways of the methods of communication in these very sensitive areas is potentially a risk both on the sort of redundancy standpoint in case that communication network were to go down or to be cut off for some reason. And also just in terms of giving one individual so much influence over US foreign policy to a certain extent. So I think that there's some concern about that beyond that there's also generally some concern on the part of the administration on Chinese investments and involvement in US businesses. And this is sort of separate from the Ukraine Russia issue, but it certainly enters into the syphias discussions around Tesla and some other companies. So I think that there is sort of broadly a desire to more carefully scrutinize foreign investment in the U.S. Whether Musk runs a foul of that effort here is sort of a separate issue, but that is definitely something that the administration is looking to be more active on in general. The meantime, Sarah, there's this reporting that Musk is planning to cut 75 percent of Twitter's workforce. This is a 7,500-person company at this point. That's a lot of people. What's the reaction inside Twitter about this news? It looks like we lost Sarah for a moment there. Dan, while we get Sarah back quickly, can you tell us the response from the White House so far on your reporting? Sure. So, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen was asked about this today. She basically said she cannot comment on syphias actions, which is a pretty common response, and that she's broadly supportive of what Musk has done on the communications front. The White House is saying they have no knowledge of these discussions, but I think our reporting is very solid in the sense that there are these discussions happening within the White House. There is sort of this broader overall question of what do you do with a problem like Yellen Musk? I mean, this is the richest person in the world who is exerting an outsized influence on foreign policy, and I think that there is a desire to rein him in a little bit, and there are some ways to do that that are both political and sort of non-political. Whether syphias gets involved at the end of the day, I think is it going to be a policy question? And my reporting sort of shows that it would be a little bit of an outside chance that syphias would get involved at this point, though not totally outside the realm of possibility given some of the foreign investment in the deal structure. So, it's just something we'll have to keep a very close eye on as things move forward. OK, so Ed, why don't you address the news that broke in the show yesterday that Yellen Musk is considering laying off 25% of Twitter's workforce, which would be thousands and thousands of people? What are Twitter employees saying? Yeah, my editor and dear friend Sarah had some technical issues there. No worries. Look, Sarah edited the story we put out on Friday, which is that it's been wellness month at Twitter, and the company's been sharing messages about work-life balance, looking after yourself. The messages coming out of Twitter are frantic. A lot of staff are very worried. They're worried that the Restricted Stock Unit award that was supposed to happen early next month will either not happen at the same date they thought or it won't happen at all. They're looking into legal options according to sources about what happens if they are laid off. Do they get the right kind of severance? They're also pretty unimpressed with management we're told. This communication that Yellen Musk was considering laying off 75% of the workforce, that's not even what's upsetting Twitter staff. I'm told that what is upsetting Twitter staff is that actually Sean Edgey at the Chief Legal Council said they had discussed cuts and layoffs, but that they ended in April when they had that definitive merger agreement. Well, that's a very different message to what management have told staff previously. So it's a pretty unhappy price and I'm told along with my colleague.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5387,2022-10-21 21:13:18
16982," In April when they had that definitive merger agreement, well that's a very different message what start management have told staff previously. So it's a pretty unhappy place and I'm told along with my colleagues Kurt Wagner and Max Adler that morale across San Francisco, New York and London is understandably pretty low right now at Twitter. Understandable indeed. Okay, Ad Leadlow, thank you along with Sarah Friar and Dan Flattany. Flattly of course we're going to continue to follow all of your reporting on this through the weekend. Coming up, Snap sends a warning to social media shareholders ahead of meta and Twitter results. If Twitter results happen, we'll discuss that next. This is Bloomberg. Anxious investors are selling out of social media stocks with $35 billion in market value wiped out just at the open. This following Snap reporting, its slowest quarterly sales growth on record. For more on this, I want to bring in Craftsman plus founder and CEO Alex Marook Cut. So what is what Snap reported here signal to you Alex? Well, I think there's a different like macro environment that we should talk about. We're advertising in general as shifting from brand advertising spend to performance spend and the problem with Snapchat and a few other social platforms. It's more geared towards brand advertisers with the lack of first party data that Apple has recently changed with their ATT framework. Really relying on first party data to drive that value. The issue with Snapchat is it doesn't have that first party data and opposite of TikTok, which is a very sticky platform driving a lot of engagement. It doesn't have that stickyness factor either. That's why I took a big hit today in the markets. How much do you think these are short term issues or are they long term issues? I think we're going to see more long term issues here in just this social space. So what the trend is happening right now is retail media. So going back to first party data, there's all these other smaller platforms that are coming up in the space right now. I think of Marriott, think of Lowe's, Home Depot. They're all building ad businesses. Amazon and Walmart's already paved the way for that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5388,2022-10-21 21:17:48
16983," They're smaller platforms that are coming up in the space right now. Think of Marriott, think of Lowes, Home Depot. They're all building ad businesses. Amazon and Walmart's kind of already paved the way for that. So because they have this first party data, the advertising dollars are no longer just spent on Facebook and Google. So you're just seeing kind of like a deteriorating spend across all the social platforms leveraging these smaller audiences. So what does this mean for? What does this mean for Alphabet? What does this mean for Twitter, which obviously has another unique storyline going on as well? So Google has a lot of first party data. I'm Gmail YouTube. They have a lot there. So they're going to be fine. They have a lot of search intent. So I'm not worried about Google. Twitter is more one of the platforms like Twitter Pinterest and Snapchat are kind of the three that I'm more worried about and concerned about their ability to drive performance for advertisers. Meta, they still have a lot of first party data. Their algorithms are really robust. I think they're going to still be able to be a player in the space and drive a meaningful value and continue to have a prosperous business. Even if Mark Zuckerberg isn't as focused on Facebook and Instagram as he is on trying to pivot into the Metaverse? I mean, Facebook is just a machine. So that company has a lot of great talent behind it. A lot of folks have built that up. So even if he is focused on Metaverse, I still think that platform is still where majority of advertisers spend their money and that's not going away at least any time soon. Now Adweek just happened in New York. What are the big themes, the big takeaways about advertising more broadly is changing? Yeah. So there's a different framework. So Apple just announced their scan for update, which is kind of their framework of how to handle privacy. And what the big changes are is we need more data. And so how do you get more data? You have that first party data, but you also have attribution windows, which is the time you can actually take credit for an impression or a click. And so what's happening is they're opening up those attribution windows to feed more data to these algorithms that are these ad platforms, which is ultimately get to boost the whole space. So we actually should see from this new release with Apple, the scan for update that there will be an overall boost in general in just ad dollars flowing to these platforms. So do you see a hierarchical shift here and where the biggest ad dollars are going or the recipients of the big ad dollars? How does this marketplace look different, let's say in five years? Yeah. So right now what's happening is Facebook's still a big player in the space. Google's going to do well. Apple's probably going to merge into it in a meaningful way. So we should look at for Apple. TikTok's got its stickiness and get it continue to drive kind of those high flyer advertisers that are looking for that mega win. They can find that on TikTok. So they still have the dream that ad business hasn't been totally proven out, but they have this stickiness factor. All these other platforms, what we're kind of seeing in the space that's interesting as well that was brought up at AdWikis connected TV. And so you're going to see a shift from these digital platforms that are just on your phone and the small advice to shifting over to larger screens connected TV with Netflix, Disney getting into the space. And what's really happening is with all this extra inventory on the space, advertising is about supply and demand. So there's advertiser demand and there's the inventory that publishers supply. With all these other platforms opening up their businesses for ad dollars. And again, this is from the macro environment of, hey, our business is hurting. We need to make money. What's an easy way to make money? Turn on ads. So everyone's turning on ads and building it that way. But you see these companies, the more inventory you have in the space and demand is ready to be lowering that we've talked about previously, so lower demand, more inventory. We're actually going to see global costs of ad impressions probably decrease over the next five years. Interesting. Okay. Alex Marouka, CEO and founder of Crafts and Plus. Thanks so much for bringing your perspective to us this Friday. All right. Coming up another top Apple executive stepping down. How this departure opens a major hole in Apple's design team next.

16984," world...... Apple's head of hardware design, Evans Hanky, is leaving the iPhone maker three years after taking the role, creating a significant vacancy at the top of the company known, of course, for its iconic designs, this according to people familiar with the matter and our own Mark German's reporting. So, Mark, what do we know about her departure and why she's leaving now? So this is a pretty significant departure. Evans Hanky is the vice president of industrial design reporting to the COO. She essentially replaced Johnny I, of Apple's former chief design officer in 2019, upon his departure. So she's been in charge of the look and feel of the iPhone, the Apple Watch, the iPad, the Mac, all of Apple's products for the last three years. The departure was announced internally within Apple this week and she'll be departing in about six months. The notable news here is that there's also no replacement for her. So Apple hasn't been able to come up with since she announced her departure internally, who would replace her at this point? Well, filling Johnny I's shoes was always going to be a difficult job for, you know, whoever was going to try to do that. But do we know why she's leaving after just three years? Yeah, at this point, it's unclear to say for certain why she is leaving. She's certainly not at the point of retirement. She's only been in that role for three years, though she has been at Apple for about two decades. She was basically the manager of the industrial design team under Johnny I. Right? So her background isn't product design, but she ran the team as a manager and it was pretty much a natural succession for her to take over for Johnny. He was her number two in that respect. There are some other senior designers that still remain, but to tell you the truth, many of them, many of Johnny I.V.'s close collaborators, most senior designers over the past two decades. The ones responsible for the designs of the products that we see today. A lot of them have either left to start their own firms, left to other companies, and some of them have joined, you know, I.V.'s love from company as well, but there still are a few top designers there. There's Richard Howarth. He temporarily had this role between 2015 and 2017, still reporting to I.V. But he's not someone who wants to manage a team. So I think it's unlikely that he takes that role again. But certainly, this is a major development for anyone who's a fan of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5390,2022-10-21 21:26:27
16985," reporting to I've, but he's not someone who wants to manage a team. So I think it's unlikely that he takes that role again. But certainly this is a major development for anyone who's a fan of the look and feel of Apple's devices. How do you imagine this will impact the product lineup? Yeah, I mean, the way Apple's product development process goes is they could be working on things in their design labs right now that we won't see for two to seven years at this point, right? If you take a look at the current Apple product lineup, the Apple watch, Series 8 has the same design as the Apple watch from four or five years ago, right? The iPad Pro, same design as four years ago. Some of their other products have legacy designs. The iPhone 14, same design as from two, three years ago, right? So we are in for a big change to Apple's designs, probably over the next year or two, just because those designs have lasted so long. And I think we're going to only see the fingerprints of Evans Hanky, Evans Hanky's leaderships over the design team in the next year or two, and then maybe four or five years in the future. We'll see how the design evolves. All right, Mark German, as always, thank you. Meantime, Instacart is reportedly holding off on plans to go public until at least next year.

16986," Good night. Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Changan, San Francisco. Let's get back to the markets in the chip sector with Bloomberg's Ad Lado. Ed, it was a good week for chips. It was a good week for chips. The Philadelphia semiconductor index or SOC's had its best week since May, but actually look at the momentum over the course of five days. This was the first straight run of five day gains we've had since November of last year. So there is momentum here. There's outperformance in the short term at least among chips stocks, but then come with me into my Bloomberg terminal and let's get a reality check of where we are. This is a completely downtrodden sector. You see the blue line which is the SOC's or the Philadelphia semiconductor index. His vastly underperformed the S&P 500. The narrative around chips has really changed, right? We've gone from this situation at the start of the year where we felt we'd have never ending quarters of double digit expansion, very expansion recycle that we would move away from the traditional boom and bust that you associate with semiconductors. But that has changed very quickly and as you know, more recently, there's a lot of concern here, not just about the drop off in demand for the end product that chips go into like consumer electronics PCs, but actually now a lot of problems with regards to China and the moves that the United States is making in terms of tech export bands, not just because of the semiconductors themselves, but also because a lot of the main players that make the equipment to make semiconductors are also US companies and that actually is a big portion of the SOC's index. So we're going to talk a little bit more about those moves now. Ed Ludlow, thank you. Sores is Tell Bloomberg. The US is looking into new rules that would limit China's access to powerful emerging computing technologies, potential plans focusing on quantum computing and artificial intelligence software. For more on these escalating tensions between the US and China, let's bring in strategy risk founder and CEO Isaac Stonefish. So tensions Isaac have been ramping up for a while and this yet again, where is this leading? So if we step back and look at how negative things have been between the United States and China and the very real possibility that China invades Taiwan as soon as this year, again, not likely, but possible, possibly the US and China are leading to war. Wow. I mean, that's a profound statement. Why go that far? We are not in a world that's past geopolitics and I think we had this nice global mental break of big power wars from the fall of the Soviet Union and from after the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the proxy war. Now we're waking up to the fact that great powers do fight wars with each other. They have throughout history and they're very likely to again. And China has been very explicit about its willingness to retake Taiwan even with force. The US has been very explicit about its willingness to defend Taiwan with force and so if China calls the United States bluff, that very much could lead to an active hot war between the world's two most powerful countries. How hot does this war get? So it depends on how lucky the world is. It could go anywhere from a limited regional...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5392,2022-10-21 21:35:00
16987," How hot does this war get? So it depends on how lucky the world is. It could go anywhere from a limited regional issuor to something that was similar to the Korean war to World War III. And it's stunning to me, as we talk to people in the investment community, that the U.S. government, and certainly the Chinese government are awake to this possibility. But the investment community seems to want to keep pretending that things will go back to where they were in the Obama era of friendship with a sprinkle of competition between the U.S. and China. And those days are over. What do you think this would mean for the tech industry? It would be transformative catastrophic to many and very positive for some who plan ahead. I think Apple, Tesla, other major companies are recognizing the difficulty of sourcing from China and trying to explore other supply chain alternatives. I think the absolute cratering of the Chinese market would be cratering for a lot of businesses' bottom lines. And I think, frankly, a lot of companies haven't started thinking about this from an ethical perspective, which is, okay, I'm a major U.S. company. I have thousands of staff in China. If China invades Taiwan, will Beijing view my staff as enemy combatants? And how do I deal with that now? There's a lot of action with Afghanistan and with Ukraine, of tech companies taking care of their employees, when those countries descended into war in chaos. What plans do tech companies have in place to take care of their own in China, if China is to invade Taiwan? Well, and if indeed that does happen, how does that play out, especially given the way we've seen the U.S. come to Ukraine's aid? To a certain extent, but Taiwan being a very also unique situation. So with the caveat that it's impossible to predict the future, I'm actually quite heartened by the U.S. restraint towards Ukraine, because I think the message that sends to Beijing is not, we're going to treat Taiwan like Ukraine, but we are preparing for the possibility of you to invade Taiwan. And so we're not fighting a two front war. We're not going to fight both Russia and China at the same time. If you invade Taiwan, we as a country will be ready for you. And we're supporting what the Ukrainians are doing, but we're keeping a lot of our power to drive, so to speak. And hopefully that message will help it turn. So you think the U.S. would be much more hands-on if China were to invade Taiwan? And Congress would let the United States not go to war with China if China launched a full-scale invasion of Taiwan. This is all terrifying, Isaac. I mean, really terrifying, especially given the 30 years of relationship building. I know you and I both spent many years in China, and it's a very different relationship. And it's evolved into a very different relationship over the last several years. What about a new administration? We've got a presidential election in a couple of years, or is this something that you see carrying on no matter who's in office? So the U.S. Navy chief just talked about the possibility of a war with Taiwan this year, next year. I'm much less worried about how things are going to play out in the medium term. I'm far more worried about 2022, 2023. Again, if I had to bet, I'd say it's less than 50% chance going to happen. And I think it's possible that a future Trump administration, if that happens again, Trump is more likely to sell out Taiwan for other concerns. I think another Republican or another Democrat would be far less likely to do so. I think it's possible that Beijing would think that right after the 2024 election before the new president takes power is the ideal time to strike. Hopefully they don't. Hopefully they decide never to try to seize Taiwan by force. But we haven't been having this debate. We haven't talked about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5393,2022-10-21 21:39:16
16988," Hopefully they don't. Hopefully they decide never to try to seize Taiwan by force. But we haven't been having this debate. We haven't talked about what should the US do now to both prepare for war with China. But also, how do we make sure that we act ethically as well? I'm quite worried about our atrocious history with Japanese Americans in World War II and German Americans in World War I. And we're already seeing bubbling of that with Chinese Americans. And I think so much of the conversation about war is how do we prevent the war as opposed to regardless of what we do, the US might go to war with China. And how do we conduct that war in a way that's most ethical and most adheres to our values? Certainly an interesting perspective. I do want to get your thoughts on the latest Blue Berkut's reporting on TikTok. We did some analysis of the deal that the US government has struck with TikTok and its parent bite dance to store US users data on Oracle servers. But Bloomberg News has concluded that this would still leave US data vulnerable. What's your take on this? TikTok in a time of good relations between the US and China is barely a threat compared to other big social media platforms. You could put it roughly in the same category as Facebook. TikTok in an era of tensions between the US and China or an era of war between the US and China can easily function as a basically national sleeper agent for Chinese intrusion into US homes, US hearts and minds, and such is very dangerous. And I think any sort of deal that gets struck between the US and Oracle and TikTok won't alay those concerns. And so if tensions reduce between the US and China, I'm not worried about TikTok. If you have a Chinese app on tens of millions of phones and the US and China are going to war, that's a huge national security concern and one that I don't think investors or the administration has fully unplugged and plumbed. Okay. That is a bleak assessment indeed. Strategy risk founder and CEO Isaac Stonefish. Thank you for joining us. Obviously a major topic we're going to continue to follow.

And here they're part of the marketing push for the latest Pixel 7 phones from the internet giant. Designed to remind us that Google also makes the other kind of chips. The ones made out of silicon. The Pixel has Google's own tensor G2 chip. The company's most advanced AI powered cameras and its litany of internet services from Google Maps and photos to YouTube and Chrome. It's hard to imagine Apple resorting to the potato chip ploy, but that's because people already know and love the iPhone, whereas Google is running ads in the US saying, did you know Google makes a phone? It says something about both the ongoing failure of Google's Pixel phones to sell and big numbers and the company's opportunity in Japan. In the US, Apple and Samsung account for 74% of the market, whereas in Japan, Samsung barely scripts together 7%. That's a missed opportunity for Google whose Android operating systems run Samsung handsets. There's scope to take chunks out of its silicon-belling rival by stealing business in a way that Samsung has so far failed to do. And if it takes spicy, savory, cheesy gimmicks to help bring attention to the cause, so be it. So how do they taste? Hmm, not bad, but there's a far taste to your meal on offer, and Google wants a piece of it. Crunchy, that was quick takes, Karumi Mori. Alright, coming up, the great...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5394,2022-10-21 21:43:36
16989," It wants a piece of it. Crunchy, that was quick takes, Carumi Mori. All right, coming up, the great resignation bleeding into the crypto industry this time is shaking up the C-suite. We'll talk more about this next. This is Bloomberg. The early season is here. It's pricing for another big and exquisite. Everyone is expecting it to be poor. It has big markdowns on earnings. Bloomberg breaks the numbers first. The big question is can it go lower? Seems a pretty bad earnings already. Those who have reported with exclusive expert analysis. Which aspects of the market are not sufficiently priced? Is this a macro-cute headwind? There is some really bright light at the end of this panel. When is this fool going to come? When can I stop on? Bloomberg television and radio. The fastest numbers and analysis you trust. Turning now to today's crypto report and opening the modelちょっと went to run a competitive I can think of Alex Mischinsky over at Celsius, Brett Harrison over at FTX US, and Sam Trabucco over at Alameda. So it's been a lot of big names, making big changes and stepping back from their companies. Why is this happening now? Obviously there's a huge, either there's a ton of volatility in the market. Is that it? Yeah, there are a number of factors here that are contributing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5395,2022-10-21 21:48:07
16990," But now obviously there's a huge, either there's a ton of volatility in the market. Is that it? Yeah, there are a number of factors here that are contributing to change some of the kind of office that made our crypto companies. So yes, the huge downturn that's affecting the market and causing crypto winter is a major reason why CEOs might be stepping back. Some are at companies that have had serious, serious issues. I'm thinking bankruptcy like LaCelsius and others are just looking to kind of save their sanity and have you been talked about taking time off to see friends and family and spare their mental health. We've also seen growing regulatory scrutiny as well. How are venture capitalists, crypto venture capitalists approaching this? Or maybe are they behind a number of these departures? Yeah, so crypto VCs are some of the industries biggest cheerleaders. We have seen a drop in funding for blockchain startups though. It was a 37% decline to $4.4 billion during the third quarter. I think they're trying to see the bright side of this. In some cases, they're looking to, they're saying that actually more experienced CEOs who might be coming from traditional finance or have actually helped companies go public might be filling these roles. So it's a new level of maturity for the crypto industry and kind of an optimistic take on what's happening here. How much more pain are we expecting? We were speaking with Kavita Gupta of Delta Blockchain earlier this week, she thinks Bitcoin's going to fall to $12,000-13,000. Even further than it's already fallen. And if that happens, I can assume there's going to be a lot more attrition. Yeah, I have talked to people who have said we should expect more layoffs down the line. That's been a huge issue for the industry. We're seeing startups buckle down for the next 18 to 24 months, speaking sure they have enough cash on hand to outlast crypto winter. I haven't talked to anyone who thinks this is going to resolve anytime soon. But yeah, people are still invested in blockchain's long term prospects. All right, Bloomberg's Hannah Miller. Thank you. Continue to follow. Coming up, expect big swings. Next week with Big Tech Results. We're going to give you a preview. Next, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5396,2022-10-21 21:52:42
16991," vez Now there we go, but brace yourselves. Next week is a big one with $15.3 trillion of market cap reporting earnings results. That's a big tech to break it all down. We're watching a lot of big names next week. We've just been dipping our toe this week. Next week is the mega caps who have an important role to play in markets because of their weighting on major indices. It's such a big lens on the world. Microsoft, alpha bet the parent company Google on October 25th. Twitter, look, we can expect a press release. We don't know what's going to happen with the Elon Musk deal, but they're not going to do a normal earnings. You hope for some commentary from them around the macro advertising environment, meta as well. After Snap, I think we very quickly turn our attention to meta and wonder if the things that hurt Snap, which weren't just a pullback in advertising, but the iOS ad tracking changes from Apple, that really hurt them. You'd imagine that's analogous for Meta as well. And then we finish strong end. We finish strong October 27th with Amazon and Apple. You know, those are our favorites. Yeah, favorites indeed. Obviously, we were talking earlier about the big ad slowdown. Let's talk about that as it pertains to Google meta or guest earlier seemed to be pretty confident in Google and meta as results. Much more concerned about names like Twitter, Pinterest and Snap as we saw. What are you looking for? Yeah, I think what's interesting in Google's case and he talked about this right in terms of search is that we learned earlier in the year where we kind of came out of the pandemic. Even in a changing economy, Google still attracts eyeballs because consumers, even if net they're spending less, they change their spending habits. They start searching for experiences, travel, plays a big part in that. Even so, they're not immune, right? To what we're seeing. The stronger dollar is also really interesting. You know, you and I have talked about that less over the last couple of years. If you think about the names we're talking about, these are big global technology companies. And in fact, when you consider the S&P 500, it is the technology sector and the communication sectors most exposed why they do business all around the world. They are bringing in international revenues that are going to get hit by that stronger dollar. So it's certainly something we'll pay attention to. And I know Ed, you are, you know, you're an eternal optimist. Right. Give us some help. What are the signs of light, the silver linings that you see? Yeah, look, there are some people out there who think the end of the world is inevitable, not naming any names. But there is a view in the market that the tech sector could hold up better in this third quarter, right? You think about these names. They're global players within trench market positions, strong balance sheets. They can weather the storm, Apple, Amazon. They are able to be nimble because of their size. Whether they pull that off or not, it's yet to be seen. But City Group, for example, are overweight global technology right now. They're optimistic that in the long run, some parts of tech can weather the storm. So we'll see if that happens. All right, Bloomberg's had led low. Thanks so much. I know you'll be across it all next week. And that does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. On Monday, we're talking about meta's new advertising strategy with Brad Erickson of RBC capital markets. Of course, we'll dive into the broader trends we're seeing in the social media, add turmoil as well, given what we were talking about, what it comes to staff, Twitter, Google, and more.

16993," The Great Sci-fi Art of the mid-20th century, teased a vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001, when an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism, private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward potential reward, but you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people in this space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with a moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how he goes. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... a whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the von Karman line, which is 100 kilometers or about 62 miles, you don't need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,000 miles.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5399,2022-10-21 22:05:29
16994," When you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up, and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives, and backgrounds, and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that, and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St. G Children's Research Hospital, and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with Leukemia and Lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space, because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side, and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s, and so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by a superpower, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station, or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low-error space has been building what they call expandable Habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable are lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high and you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the attorney for any of the space tours. So I haven't been privy to their private contracts. But I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of that hazards that you know of that I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5400,2022-10-21 22:09:52
16995," He starts sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here, we don't think about a human right to oxygen because it's all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes, who gets the oxygen first? And then, of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel, where that person may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do in microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good, when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting, and it will probably happen. But it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip at one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space, and it's going to be millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-ordinal space. When it becomes more like buying a first class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal, and the question is, can we get to that point? The first class ticket to the United States. Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard, and it's an absolutely shake, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight at Kitty Hawk. I mean, you had less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species, and we want to go out there and see what's out there. A vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5401,2022-10-21 22:16:21

I'm an industrial designer out of L.A. and I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. We had a cab and we got here lay last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM land right on the outskirts of National Forest and it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan Sweettruck. The 2019 Ford Ranger has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. But just on a smaller simple scale. You drive us around day to day in L.A. and then just roll out when you want it. The RV handle is great.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5402,2022-10-21 22:20:27

And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box, stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Alny. Miss phenomenal. I'm just gonna pull that over. That's cool. We just pop that up. Sort of. So home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots, is that you bustin' out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go, or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals? And if I see a dirt road, I just want to go down it. So a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason, it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation room somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Road trip apps, camping apps, they proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos.

16998," The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your semity. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. No stopping, no getting out. No problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd we got out of the smoke. But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your semity. For the smokey... Look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across your Semity National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're going to wear here in this near Fresno. This is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg. So we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of guys. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically with his dad, was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out their spring and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5404,2022-10-21 22:29:13
16999," And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and That they're doing the correct job So it tells them what speed they're driving the engine RPM the amount of Gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time So if any one of the machines has an issue it's going to send an alert to that laptop Much like a self-driving car these beasts use GPS light R in cameras to see and navigate the world around them They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance Gus builds the machines right here And then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human masters command So this this is kind of like that. This is a test orchard where you guys Put it through the paces and work on the technology Yeah, so this is our our test Orchard right here. It's right by our building and so you can see in the background So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line It's put through a commissioning test right here We test all the sensors on the machine autonomous computer all the safety systems make sure it's doing what is doing Prior to when it's delivered to a customer So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure Spraying water out of the muscles just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan Okay, and that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and People the world over have taken notice of its machines and if you just sold them in the central valley or like throughout the US Or even overseas or where like where they go Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the central valley However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia I think you start selling them in like December of 2019 Yeah, so we started taking orders Early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019 Okay, and how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price and the main thing is is that the return on Investment is very very quick do the all the labor savings and the increased efficiency I mean these machines they just they just drive But basically what we're doing besides this machine this is our our first machine we call it orchard Gus Mainly designed for your your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future We're working on a few other projects. We're gonna do more machines one of them is actually a vineyard sprayers So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating that Right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table Gary's Ted talk can't be far off And with that it was time to get back in the RV And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole the moon in December 2022 instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5405,2022-10-21 22:33:41
17000," Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself, but for the last few months she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic gastronolot? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds, but this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusty companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ella Kew. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ella Kew. Tell me what you can do. I'm a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends, and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? That's why she has a head that can not make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Like, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human. Because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ella Kew isn't on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ella Kew, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5406,2022-10-21 22:37:54
17001," Critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.E.Q. From the way L.E.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.E.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now see this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say no I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.E.Q. Yes. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take advanced classes. She fought for it and she got injured and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job at Ugradskoll was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming about kinds of wacky, far-fling ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined Intuition Robotics.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5407,2022-10-21 22:42:18
17002," join intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now, and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where Chloe likes to circle with men with their zip up jacket with their company logo on it and a beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick, and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first, she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need, and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? It's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive, and playful, and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water. At least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was... I could see that quite clearly. What about this? I can see that. LEQ, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. Is it kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day? It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Your promise is a friendly place.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5408,2022-10-21 22:46:45

An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. Here I am, here I am, how do you do? But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. And I think it was surprised, unclutchier means the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves, like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. We rely those.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5409,2022-10-21 22:50:57
17004," Ice and care! Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37 year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes and now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials and you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore and to them entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toy started to become designed for a 30 second commercial. Closed at some mild amount of true bucks open at some micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes and both of the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway, passenger rapid garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30 second commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with you know what you could say and features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. The power of the Batman. See of Batman. Batman's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business, just you know growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like, what was the time when this computer was used or generated content, like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, Lazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Killsonania! YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone. And it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5410,2022-10-21 22:55:23
17005," with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, we saw this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this home-new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data at Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child to speak unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy. You know, and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited, seen it piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from adults perspective just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. They were just shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that, I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you could collect. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016, they were a small player of the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh, you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy on box. Oh my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL prize.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5411,2022-10-21 22:59:47
17006, Hosting it. So that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate and that's it that's it first L.O.L. surprise. All right oh yes we've got a goal ball. L.O.L. changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open up package you take the toy out that's not exciting. You open up L.O.L. you peel it away. You open up inside. You have seven surprises and it took off like wildfire and quickly became you know the top toy in the country. By December of 2018 eight of the top 10 toys sold were all L.O.L. surprise brand and according to MGA from 2016 to 2020 L.O.L. would generate over 10 billion dollars in retail sales worldwide. You know L.O.L. was bigger than Star Wars it's bigger than Marble. It's bigger than Barbie these brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to you know figure out what Marble are or Star Wars is and L.O.L. it clips them all. In the toy world blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of L.O.L. in 2014 the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016 spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets L.O.L. surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube and not putting ads on YouTube but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually the move towards YouTube was was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015 Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their L.O.L. loop seedles. They tried to flex their muscle and they said well if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had they said that conflict we are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA necessity is the mother of invention that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom both in L.A. federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and blame the court to feed on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So dad buys their forces to go and say okay they had with Nickelodeon and let's find another way to reach to children and that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially and the rest as they say. So early on MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl-C. Good morning Choppity Chippy Cookies we are going to be spending the morning with this L.A.L. Surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5412,2022-10-21 23:04:00
17007," Morning, Choppity Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them, you know, support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ads spend. And then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, lures the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. The channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. And they do something for you. And gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following now because it is such a big business. The dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package. With Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. Creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids and, you know, the content's coming out maybe once a week or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically like a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. When you had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows create around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a 170 million dollars-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5413,2022-10-21 23:08:24
17008," It's crazy around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that, responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the new genres and formats there that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. That has profound effects for entertainment going forward. The Kaji family is the most important thing in the world. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year, and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation, and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team, and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. The company is a startup that's-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5414,2022-10-21 23:12:46
17009," online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things. And it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast, that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night this past August, we had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests, and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Airbnb, and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds, they're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of men's civics. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5415,2022-10-21 23:17:08
17010," and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into her room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back, and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City, where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys, and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5416,2022-10-21 23:21:28
17011," And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what your VMV's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. VMV's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Chesky, the chief executive of VMV, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, the VMV's entire business model is under threat. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity and ambition. We'll be hit quadrace for the final sense of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupua. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the cysteine chapel, the pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5417,2022-10-21 23:25:50
17012," in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the coarseness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down floating everywhere I went, but your first impressions for ISS certainly is it's how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections, they're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low Earth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that'll be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems, but then use them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5418,2022-10-21 23:29:59
17013," Huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is... It's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail. But over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one-fiftyth, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. And that's really it. Okay, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components here on the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. So whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one. Release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nascent. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5419,2022-10-21 23:34:20
17014," Space Station, let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said, that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers. It might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A four-story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Marsha, the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets, but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon on Mars would be so exhortatively expensive you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials. We find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt. A rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. If you think of an egg, it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very, very thin, but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. More research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh. The cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space. And funny solutions for how to build or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. You need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5420,2022-10-21 23:38:39
17015," Here on Earth. Two, one. Ignition and liftoff. They falconed nine to the space station. On the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, Historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home, so we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is a very important step. We're going to need to take another giant leap. We're going to need to take another giant leap. We're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, and they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, is turn the real estate business upside down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5421,2022-10-21 23:42:57
17016," Touches has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before. Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen-exers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis we have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older, they're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child, so looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AM area, Austin, Texas, so they are certainly moving out of the city but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life, often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quid essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5422,2022-10-21 23:47:20
17017," tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings. They have alerts. They find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media. It's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth. And the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw, instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Real estate ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills and California, most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rull and Charlotte main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're gonna make a greenhouse.

Heather, having bought her fixer-up her site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple do it yourself project you can do that. You have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say here's a turnkey air be this can serve our family but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for you know working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit but it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at 4.50 we could put two 300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. I can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram they say I love it can you come build this on my property and then they'll send us the lot which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things so while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework don't believe everything you say that's not to say that you know there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people get mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology there's ways to get around that as long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,5424,2022-10-21 23:56:09
