13419," $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner he'd been friends with, Lorenzo Fertida and his brother Frank Fertida. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalries, while throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. Sat us all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey, we realize that this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this UFC family moving forward. So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way, just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long-term, they last multiple fights. These under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time and UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of strike force Scott Coker has...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1645,2022-10-11 00:04:07
13420," It's unbelievable. It was a great buy this year for one more time. Scott Smith and Conley. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Coker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zoufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. The UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran afoul of the law by cutting off two its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case of this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa LLC with fighters Kungli, Nekori and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jackson came to me and said, hey Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an anti-trust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsony is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1646,2022-10-11 00:08:28
13421," to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something I've had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached car dogs the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. A fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Rating Attours, it's been driven by Conor McGregor, it's been driven by Brock Lesnar, it's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release this from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1647,2022-10-11 00:12:49
13422," Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport and we are every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. People tell fighters, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well no actually we are fighting for what we believe in. We are going to continue being fighters and that is how we are made. Every nation that is a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the US, the area that is underwater exceeds the area that is above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what is there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something you start to value it more. When you start to value something that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. We cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail. But in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons. There are sea mounts. Mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from the sea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1648,2022-10-11 00:17:08
13423," All kinds of interesting topography, there are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world-ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or JEPCO, launch SeaBed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data oceanwide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transits. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available, there's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since SeaBed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20% and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple, usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hull in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82 meter long research vessel equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is, I call it, math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1649,2022-10-11 00:21:36
13424," And if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the C-floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the C-floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 metres in shallow waters to 800 by 800 metres in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 metres. Remotely operator vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate C-bed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the C-floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon discovered a 500 metre tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, you know, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it, and so until you get that sort of high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of, let's say Hawaii, or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape, but, I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath, and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 metres, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge insights as we go out into space as well, and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality, and for that we'll allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see at this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and pl-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1650,2022-10-11 00:26:03
13425," menu and even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm Babe Tobi, one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011 developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scramble eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person, trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we certainly need, if you will, an in-game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially, he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce cultured chicken is essentially a weak isolate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1651,2022-10-11 00:30:13
13426," technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eatjust is developed chicken nuggets so far with formal textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis Meets has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favorites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they meet. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we gave cows and takes and chickens. But there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest into allowing the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same thing. So we need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that. And hammering on those things of the course of the next five, 10, 15 years. We'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that will lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just, I'm eating chicken. I like chicken. You know, the normal chicken's eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually. And there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1652,2022-10-11 00:34:40
13427," The 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergey Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this disruptive potential of the market, as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab ground meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab ground meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more human, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. And we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really helpful. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So, there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called artificial meat? The realest, fakeest burger in the world. What about? But, before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangle to meat goes mainstream. When possible foods was founded in 2011, when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been a scientist my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. And reducing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to help develop our Europe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1653,2022-10-11 00:38:58
13428," Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So, him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the heme. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real, we're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Pat and his colleagues were confident they had a product even run sponsored and could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger, again, it's life in the public when it was sold at David Chang's Mama Fuku. And they went from sort of higher-end, fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's just like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. No, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the Impossible Burger's relative meatiness, but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel Impossible into major chains like White Castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 Burger Kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around 4 billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and people faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat Shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So Impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They are a huge market. China is a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1654,2022-10-11 00:43:21
13429," The interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture and whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns. Although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with the crogr supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just have to wait and see. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything like that. Very, very much. What are a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere. You go because it is a contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialised in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like Job Creation and better infrastructure.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1655,2022-10-11 00:47:38
13430," One of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before, an outside power comes into Pakistan, it spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. A great future for a country to develop a new environment. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China Central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadar is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army, the people who...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1656,2022-10-11 00:51:58
13431," achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Bullochistan Liberation Army, the people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Bullochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think of the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost a sort of forward-based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19km highway linking the port with the Maccrankoastal highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese-built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalists spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1657,2022-10-11 00:56:24
13432," for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic corridor is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out. We're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays, accumulating debts, commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. He wasn't there before. Where's my gun? Tanks, keep her steady. I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Project Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open-world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing and the expensive development. When CD Project stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of The Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Project's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most gaming was done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in<|pl|><|translate|> paste by citegan appellations and places to link in the video description.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1658,2022-10-11 01:00:54
13433," You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs. And these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle, so we're actually pretty bad with counting money. So you can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car, you know, you can kind of think about it the same way. It was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland and as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do and making a lot of money and in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be The Launch of The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling and emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year awards but along with being a critical success. For CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up concerning by 2014 The Witcher and The Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro transaction to the unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1659,2022-10-11 01:05:12
13434," CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer-friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no-brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. Thanks for watching! It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer at the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars, lots of stuff but it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this feverish level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk, look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else we could get a score and appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. This if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to download. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1 E3 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come to the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later at E3 2019, fans would get another big surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1660,2022-10-11 01:09:17
13435," Like sometime they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh, what?! He's welcome. He's welcome. He's welcome. The fear of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking. You're breathtaking! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. We saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. When you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the Polish stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. And the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from VCEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Under the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features. And while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready. But a similar sort of thing happened with the Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. In some studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1661,2022-10-11 01:13:58
13436," to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting new lesson, less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing. But in this case, it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it was an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking from the city of Gujian Faza. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks. And my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is San Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Mug News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies, and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China, and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of basically hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1662,2022-10-11 01:17:55
13437," both go regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacked ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. You know, he's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports coal basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. In terms of cyber hacking abilities in that context, it doesn't cost them much money. But if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about a thousand IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describing accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1663,2022-10-11 01:22:20
13438," And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there he took a bus and then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of the city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open. And commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal. To account to control by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. Jung had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever message, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1664,2022-10-11 01:26:43
13439," He did the same thing he did, you know, at the North Green Union. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer a software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of it all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. Once they had access to outside information, and once they were able to freely roam in the Internet, there was a spark. And once they realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning, that's when the spark gets bigger. The little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave. Even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Muscling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment. The rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s. Sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls, and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1665,2022-10-11 01:31:56
13440," An interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or JC Penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have all the set of things that we've been doing We have all the seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off. And that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall often times. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965. So for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America, about what do you do when these large department stores as a business decision on their end are trying to just stay in the high quality malls? How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy?fashioned email.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1666,2022-10-11 01:35:46
13441," [♪ OUTRO!] Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the U.S. is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years, to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet, residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Those are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great maceys, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that maceys is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall and that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z's. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power and once you win over teens hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post COVID world? So our view is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US out of the thousand malls in the country there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high end. So I'm talking about ball harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is America. There. all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1667,2022-10-11 01:40:01
13442," Ductive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about bal harbour shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high, but also they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall. To help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. So the number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I still I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts save post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell. President Trump traveled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1668,2022-10-11 01:44:04
13443," They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the sides of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. The company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. That's in the case is still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet and we have an evil government and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia is in business to save our home planet and then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up it says both the assholes out, very implicit running up to the election and it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place and on that digital platform it says both the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows, I mean Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about he calls himself a dirt bag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that juvenile delinquent because you know they're saying you know this sucks but I'm going to do it my own way. Of course like every other teenage kid I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of rock climber Avantioen Arts first business, Schuwenart Equipment which made and sold climbing supplies. Schuwenart was a blacksmith in the 50s and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company it's called itself the activist company A activist company. Six months out of the year, Avantioen Art is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Avantioen Art and four friends including Doug Tomkins the late founders of the North Face brand embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds they could be on the summit within days. The strip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the new semi-tie where the sport became a lifestyle and how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuwenart moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenart and his wife.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1669,2022-10-11 01:48:24
13444," Schuwenard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuwenard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits like on-site childcare that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account, you know, the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people. I knew that, that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuwenard labels an Earth tax. I don't think it's for land three, it's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schuwenard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. And we're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schuwenart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in ten languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of companies created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty gritty on, you know, the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into, you know, a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schuwenart said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1670,2022-10-11 01:52:49
13445," destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales, which is sizable. And that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things that's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas including adventure capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike who made 37 billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized bests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagucci. It's expensive stuff, it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism you know a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. The Patagucci label is a symptom of that. Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active. For instance, you know people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office. And that's because of the image that the brand projects. And they have to leave with the fact, although they preach for the environment and want to stand for good, they're victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration. Now in 2020 things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration. Patagonia appointed Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes, this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship. But Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration, they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about. And that's climate change in the environment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1671,2022-10-11 01:57:07

13447," These Hybrid Okay, you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun... It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we're building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward-looking. More? More? Good? Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porak. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porak landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full-time. We're thinking it'd probably be a three-two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular, sites where you have great, diverse populations. Sundar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, literally forever. Obviously you're embracing this massive cultural shift, but what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life, and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think, about my career, and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being pot-pron into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of Alphabet, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well, I love being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO of the day James Gorman became CEO yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well and I just wanted that next chapter. My view in my career, I've always been focused on kind of continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s which is notorious boys club.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1673,2022-10-11 02:05:57
13448," Heist and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious boys club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a boys club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? Well, when I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now. And it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be, but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now, if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working, or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth, is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack-rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together, and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession. What lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity, and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy, six to 12 months prior to build a interval liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hangpaws at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way, and you just assume, you know what, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, look, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns, in particular, is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Let me in the middle of 10.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1674,2022-10-11 02:10:30
13449," Go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? The main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth. We're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions. We're continuing to be active, more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. We think there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us. We're continuing to invest in partnerships, in some acquisitions, and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? Would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them? At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation, and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there's a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. A real surge in searches about where is a black owned business near me and the ability to direct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1675,2022-10-11 02:14:27
13450," tools and skills. Same with the number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement. Let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we, our commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eight search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example, in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1676,2022-10-11 02:18:56
13451," hhm You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, at the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there. And I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons. And I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt. And when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, they'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. That don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1677,2022-10-11 02:23:25
13452," Shri, I don't need to over-dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it, I get the mom guilt, I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently, but I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt, it's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our, like, if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize, I'm a professional. I do things when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't, but I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. You're telling your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself. And I'm getting, I feel guilty doing it, but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation and people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution with huge choices ahead? Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle and people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their lives. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that our, this generation, appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission, are you delivering on the mission, is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with. Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations and then we all vote and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Ooh, so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years, pretty nice, with the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, I don't pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very modern question about capital allocation. Because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity. I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change, they were very serious about moving to this board role and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for counsel wherever, whenever. But most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Philip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1678,2022-10-11 02:27:48
13453," allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phillip and Thomas and yes we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? You know it's fascinating to was I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and it you know is video going to be the first of the way they understand it's going to be about you know search is going to be a different type of experience so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So there's going to it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally like what where will you you know it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth like what you feel you've accomplished in the last you know since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. And I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about well what does that mean for each one of our areas there's I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions so to me it's continuous learning. Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for doing it. Of course. Sorry I'm late and I'm coming late. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So you're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. How about you? I guess you come in? Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask, is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go in you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Ford and raised in India, Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college, but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1679,2022-10-11 02:32:25
13454," and later Alphabet now valued at more than $2 trillion. It's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshaws as a company. You know, people will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube, Cloud, our hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are 3 billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel it everywhere when I go talk to people. And providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over 2 billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people. Every day when people come to Google, they place their trust to us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. There is no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. When we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think those who will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent, and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something, I think, all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, we were exposed to a set of concerns. We invested. It became our number one priority to work harder at it. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we've.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1680,2022-10-11 02:36:16
13455," between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it. You grew up in India. You lived through droughts. Water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India. And a big part of my childhood was, you know, really pretty severe water scarcity. You know, we would get water trapped in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred-year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and, you know, definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You know, you have to keep the economies growing, you know, it really matters. And, but at the same time, it's a pretty severe, urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris Agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But, you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy, to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are not pushing. It's a moonshot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1681,2022-10-11 02:43:39
13456," Urban neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, we are now pushing, it's a moonshot, to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, et cetera, over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of, there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? It's such a fencing time frame. Glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet that are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends, which are here and embracing the future. Digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud. Because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally, so a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There's a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, what the US-China Agreement on Climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas, which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one. AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one. Obviously, sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together. And so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different versions of how the internet lays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China? Or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today, we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China. I don't see that changing. But there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there'll be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies, which have presents everywhere. And so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate. And it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. Done correctly, in many ways, it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. But it's something people take for granted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1682,2022-10-11 02:47:50
13457," the same way today, for example, in India, over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted, you can do it. So over time you will expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. So these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role. And I think we'll see that if it's of that. You mentioned if done correctly. And there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society, even under Google's own roof, from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity. And any time you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. I think it's more important that there are outside academic institutions, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza, just learning cook, which I was never good at. It's a little bit better. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. And the biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. They don't track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1683,2022-10-11 02:52:06
13458," It forced us to think about new answers. So for example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem, but we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. So going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York, that's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? Okay. I look at the fact that, you know, we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. And many people come and people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google that are, I think there are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as supers. I'm equally proud of that, right? I think we are one part of a big, big system. And, you know, I think, I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people. And the impact they have over time in the outside world. All right. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Hi, you know, pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow. Stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. Okay. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more calming. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game someday. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. It's a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So, you know, watching other games. It's a fact. It's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and, you know, talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But, you know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but, you know, in and out. In and out. Okay. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? You know, I talk to them regularly. You know, it kind of ebbs and flows. You know, and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through, but it depends on, you know, what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. 20s would be, you know, being patient. You know, I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the young, you know, the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, you know, when I look at climate, and I want all of us to be impatient. So, you know, I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. Yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1684,2022-10-11 02:56:40
13459," You personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make. And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet, not just alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. On the first one, there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and some decisions weigh on me. But it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. Well, we'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Emily. Bless you to be here. However you get your news. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake.

13460," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC enjoyed by NOTHING 對lords 5 8oll another another another another another another a Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. He worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. It's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was, you know, principally with Andy, who of course was, you know, knew the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was, you know, contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1686,2022-10-11 03:05:17
13461," or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent size business when I left, but it's really grown. And the customer base is really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s. And I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well, it was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it, but of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess, I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea. And I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes. And Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, head start before other companies really started to take this seriously, and frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being a highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now, AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents and not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. Instructure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1687,2022-10-11 03:09:31
13462," You keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. And structure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody? Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge. And we all compete vigorously. But it is the segment is just growing so rapidly that I think really for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things? And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? I'm going to get you in trouble. I'm going to get you in trouble. I'm going to get you in trouble. I'm going to get you in trouble. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you. You're going to get me in trouble, aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you going to do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the new hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff? Or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be very good Andy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1688,2022-10-11 03:13:29
13463," It's important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume, but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff, because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and we'll having operated that business for so long. And I expect that'll also give him an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon, certainly for a number of years, we'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful, I think, just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well, I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. And right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate. And so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, we, the business grew. But Jeff was always available when we needed him. And I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities. But certainly, Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, would we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm used, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days. 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1689,2022-10-11 03:18:15
13464," Running multiple parts modern on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS, all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. Does that concern you? Well, actually, retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes, that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have, both because we're going to serve our customers best their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also, I just believe it's our responsibility, and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not something is not gone the way we wanted to, we're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS, is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led, an inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are no or close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1690,2022-10-11 03:22:49
13465," Great news. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we're very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, we're very clear that our customers' data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers' data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic Runs, almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres, in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right. See you there. Now, I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. That's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created. And to which we've now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1691,2022-10-11 03:26:42
13466," He said 2030, we actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries. All new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassie is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. Partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing, and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

13467," All right, so here we are on the elephants. Since this very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one-click journey to the center of the zeitgeist pop culture and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us. While YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism and violence many clicks along the way. Currently, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next, with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is... Baby Shark? Baby Shark. So, a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and technology moves so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. Overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators, we've invested a lot in responsibility. That's been a really big focus for us. With weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall, I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey. In the garage, you've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed, certainly, has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So, when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand, and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so, a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video, and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue, and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music, and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscription. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself, and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight when they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy, and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there are so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1693,2022-10-11 03:35:17
13468," with the world. And so there's so many people or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six figure income out of YouTube and in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? It is a competitive landscape. And in general, I mean, competition is good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world like and YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame. And also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a hundred million dollar black voices fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds. Become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is with enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. It's how important are YouTube shorts to the platform to the company. YouTube first, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content long form short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me and the zoo was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1694,2022-10-11 03:39:47
13469," 🎵 Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. Six feet apart. You have to feed your creativity. So this tree house, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that will remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be, that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know. How do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like, we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing, you know, creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the... Right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not... They are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. Should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1695,2022-10-11 03:44:16
13470," should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or something that they're something their family member learned. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the homeschooling, we had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest, they usually don't want to be on the kids app. But they're not 13 to be on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users, the influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are, how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids, it's really, it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive, is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly wanna make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended, but actually then has a really negative impact. temosal cannot ek tellas meditation is filming by nature.

13471," We are connecting Sort because we know everything Nikini is out there right now with horns as well. We are charging in from right now. We look for the battery. I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, is incredibly important. And we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world and there were a number of leaders that are and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump and you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request, what's actually happening on the ground and peace.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1697,2022-10-11 03:52:57
13472," Um, and, and we look and consider what's, you know, why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? Um, and based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. Um, so we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but uncertain cases. We will honor them in that country. The five administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. Um, and because YouTube is part of Google, um, sender has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And, you know, if it's, I wherever I asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. Um, and I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of, um, a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's hard to be a, it's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, you know, I asked you about being a mom. You have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do, then, you know, you're going to get there faster. Lauren, started having a left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we aren't doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects or I feel like, I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you, would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar is doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing, I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not workwise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes it would be casually, but our business is very complex right now. And there's a lot of things that are happening. And so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage at a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. I just met with a number of three creators and YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one. Continuing to grow that. I'd say second, it's been really important to me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1698,2022-10-11 03:57:24

I'd say second, it's been really important to me too, to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have and I know it was due to like many different factors. And I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful. And then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education. Susan, would you please have YouTube? Thank you so much for having me. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

13474,"易 This is Lubric Daybreak Middle East. Our top stories is this morning. The case for caution. Fed Vice Chair, Leo Brainer and Outline's reasons to be careful as central bank raises its rates to curb high inflation. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty moving forward deliberately in a data dependent manner, we'll enable us to learn how economic activity, employment and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessment of the path of the policy rate. Meanwhile, there's a risk off mood across markets as the IMF and World Bank warn of a rising risk of a global recession with a potential of $4 trillion of lost output through 2026. As the warning Ukraine intensifies, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates travels to Russia today to meet with President Putin. At the UK bond market, Selaf deepens as lawmakers return to parliament later for the first time since quasi-quarting mini-budget RECT havoc. It's just gone 80M across the Emirates. I'm use of Gamelidine into bi-geopolitical angst and inflation worries are weighing on investor appetite across the board. We're seeing that reflected on the S&P 500 mini as we speak and especially in US stocks overnight, we're called lower by about half of 1% bank of America flags the risk of not so much the earnings season that passed. But what is to come? Guidance is going to be terrible. I think I'm also looking at the bond markets where we saw some huge moves, yields rising about 10 basis points with the traders eyeing FOMC comments. US tens at the moment is short of the 4% handle. There is a bare steepening on the way. You're 30 years. The yields there are the highest since 2014. The Bloomberg dollar index gets a lift yet again. This is a fifth day of gains and then Brent Crude that slowed down concerns weighing were just under $96 as a barrel. I want to get to the UK bond Selaf because that's deep and the bank of England has failed to support the markets. This chart tells the story in terms of magnitude in terms of scale. The 10 year inflation linked yields jumped 64 basis points to 1.24%. A comment here from Bank of New York, Mellon in an analysis. The Bank of England is going to calm the market. Sure. But it's not going to save the market. You're going to ensure that liquidity for the pension funds most badly affected but they're not going to cap yields. This is going to be huge of course for the remainder of the trading day and then as we count down to some of the earnings announcements give you a sense of where the investor sentiment is out with the fear gauge. The VIX. We're just creeping higher above the key handle of about 30. We've had throughout the year several peaks between 33 and 38 but we've stayed away from the other important marks psychologically which has been the 40 line which in the past has been a sign of panic or a capitulation depending on your interpretation. Let's get to some of the interpretations in the market in Asia and some factual analysis with Juliet Sally. She joins us for our Singapore studio. Jules. Hey, Yusuf. Well, what an ugly day particularly as we see these chip stocks continue to be under pressure. As soon as Taiwan resumed trade after the holiday yesterday you saw a 7% fall coming through from TSMC which is going to report earnings this week too. So these restricted curbs again from the US. The increase between the tensions between the US and China very much weighing in on the chip players. You've got the TIEX now at November 2020 lows. The Hangseung Tech Index is at January 2019 levels and we saw South Korea which was out of action yesterday and Japan also fall into the red even though you did have that hopes of a reopening case.

13475," January 2019 levels and we saw South Korea, which was out of action yesterday. And Japan also fall into the red. Even though you did have that hopes of reopening play, really lift Japan tourism stocks. It really is this tech piece that is weighing on the overall market sentiment. Also seeing weakness amongst Asian currencies today too, including in the on and off shore Remembes. Despite the PBOC once again, really trying to defend that you won. You did have a stronger than expected you won fix for a 29th day. Let's have a look at the overall picture in Japan when it comes to their economy too, because I mentioned the hopes that this reopening will have in terms of boosting the overall economy. But we have seen the second current account deficit posted on the adjusted measure. This is the first consecutive decline for Japan. Going back to 1996 and really showing the impact that the weaker yen is having as it weighs on import costs in Japan and paying the picture of this bleak fundamental picture for the Japanese economy as we continue to see, of course, a global recession fears really take hold use of. Yeah, the cloud is definitely gathering jewels. Thank you for the moment. We will check back in with you later on in the show. Julie, it's not only there. I want to get to our top story. The Fed, Vice Chair, Leo Brainard has laid out a case for caution and made aggressive central bank hiking around the world. She says that previous increases are still working their way into different parts of the economy, and we're only starting to see the effects now. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a data dependent manner, we'll enable us to learn how economic activity, employment and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessment of the path of the policy rate. Right. And also warn that slowdowns elsewhere around the world could circle back to hit the US economy. For more, let's bring in our chief Asia economic correspondent and the current. Lisa, it seems to me that this time around, we heard a little bit of an opportunity for potential moderation in the hawkishness of this Fed. Are you buying into this? There was a hint of concern. You've no data about it. Ms. Brainard made a point that they have to wait and see just how these rate hikes are going to impact data. She mentioned the employment numbers. For example, we know that labor market data is a lagging indicator and it will take months before the hit the mortgage rate start to impact households and businesses. So there was a sense of caution from her. She did also give a nod of course to the global story which continues to deteriorate. But you would have to say it wasn't quite a signal of a pivot by Ms. Brainard. The Fed is broadly expected to remain on track to go with that 75 base point move in a few weeks now, which will be adding to its extraordinary interest rates. This year we have US inflation. This week, even if it comes in, I bit slower than expected. No one expects the Fed to suddenly, much altered course from what it's expected to do. The market's fully priced in for 75. So Ms. Brainard did signal a hint of caution, but it's not necessarily caution for now. Perhaps in a few months time she'll be ready to signal that they should step back and pause and see how the rate hikes are playing out. In terms of the risks of abroad, I'm also listening to some of the commentary from the IMF and the World Bank. They're kind of chipping into this global recession discussion. What's it out to you there? Couple of new lines from the IMF use of their talk about maybe one-third of the global economy this year and next falling into a technical recession. They're talking about $4 trillion worth being wiped off global economic output over coming years. Interest in either seeing some signs of weakness in the US labor market, and they also said in particular it will take a while for rate hikes to impact the jobs market there. That was an interesting line. It was some commentary about a strong dollar hurting developing nations. And then of course the rest of it we're quite familiar with. It's China's real estate slowdown, COVID-0, and of course the price of gas in Europe. When you take it all together, the IMF and the World Bank are warning that the world isn't far off, a global recession, and all it would take is another shock to tip into that scenario. Yeah, we're at the very, very edge of it all. Aren't we? It definitely looks like it. And the current with some extra analysis from Hong Kong. Let's talk about some of the important interviews that are coming up. I want to give you a rundown. One is a conversation that is going to be broadcast live. That is going to be with Cleveland, Fed President Loretta Messer. It happened in tomorrow at 2 a.m. Dubai time. That's 6 a.m. if you're in Hong Kong and Singapore. Let's get to China now because the country is sticking with COVID-0.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1701,2022-10-11 04:10:29
13476," that happening tomorrow at 2 a.m. Dubai time at 6 a.m. if you're in Hong Kong and Singapore. And let's get to China now because the country is sticking with COVID-19 zero as fears of a return to lockdown in places including Shanghai, way on markets. Authorities are taking a few chances so close to the party congress it starts on Sunday in Beijing. Our chief North Asia correspondent Steven Engel joins us now. So Steve, new science and that it's premature to think that COVID-19 zero could soon be relaxed. Yeah, I mean there are economic reasons to relax it but right now it's a heavily politically charged season in China with the party congress starting on Sunday and I'm sure Xi Jinping will tout the successes of his COVID-19 zero policies in his address on Sunday to the opening of the party congress. Meanwhile, the cases in China rising up to a two-month high. We have one thousand nine hundred and eighty nine new cases nationwide on Monday after the week long holiday in China. People returning to their homes getting tested before they can get on trains and the like. And there are certain signs of lockdowns whether it's in Shanghai, Minsang district is seeing a somewhat soft or semi lockdown with some residential compound seeing fences around their apartment complexes, we're seeing an entire city of four hundred thousand in Shansi province lockdown entirely not because they had any cases because authorities simply didn't want to risk any residents returning from the week long holiday and spreading the virus. So the whole city is in lockdown. We have a number of cases in Beijing, 14 new cases, Shanghai had 28 cases, Xinjiang 33, Xi'an 11, Inner Mongolia is still the biggest hotspot right now in this recent flare up. But yeah, all indications, including from state media, the people's daily with a big article today essentially saying that it is sustainable, that is COVID zero policies is sustainable, it stabilizes the economy, it claims and has saved lives. And then in the meantime in Japan, they are going in the opposite direction, essentially fully opening their borders to inbound toers starting today. So are some of the additional details that have been announced? Yeah, absolutely. So essentially any inbound toers from 68 countries as long as they're vaccinated, they no longer need all the rules that for the better part of the last three years has kept Japan isolated from the outside world. If you're vaccinated, you don't need a visa anymore. The Japanese Prime Minister, Kishida, has talked about this could be a boon obviously to the tourism sector in Japan. They had a record number of tourists pre-pandemic in 2019, 32 million in 2019. And among others, Goldman Sachs is saying that they could surpass that within a year pre-pandemic levels, given the fact that there's a week yen, $145 to the dollar and relatively tame inflation in Japan, it needs a shot in the arm that economy. Stephen, thank you very much for giving us perspective on the story. That's our chief North Asia correspondent, Stephen Angle. I want to get to the president of the United Arab Emirates. We are expecting him to arrive in Moscow in the coming hours to meet with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. We got a generic readout about discussing global peace and security from the state news agency. But look, the UAE is a close ally of the U.S., but they've tried to be a little bit neutral at the beginning over the war in Ukraine. Then last month, they backed the UN Security Council resolution condemning Russia's annexation referenda. But here's the prism we need to look at the situation. I look at the ECTR, the trade flows. It's such a crucial indicator of some of the priorities for the country. Trade volumes with China and India are at the very top. But the reality is, even though the United States is up there, Russia is nowhere to be seen in the top 15 here. And the UAE has been pushing to play a larger role in mediation efforts alongside some of these trade relationships. We've normalized diplomatic ties with Israel, which was a historic move for the country. The Dubai former finance chief has waited on this. He says, look, the UAE is going to try and diffuse a European war that no one expected, but could reach a new level of escalation. We keep a close eye on the events as they unfold.

Reports have emerged of Iranian oil workers joining protests over the death of a 22-year-old woman last month in the custody of so-called morality police. Unverified social media videos purportedly show dozens of laborers and uniformed workers marching through a plant in Boucher. International pressure on Iran's leadership is also mounting with the UK imposing sanctions on its security forces. A pro-Russia hacker group says it's responsible for temporarily knocking out some of the websites of some of the biggest U.S. airports offline. New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago were among those airports affected. They said there was no impact on their operations. A hacker group called Killnet has launched cyber attacks against a number of Western targets. Britain is facing calls to slash public spending by an amount twice as big as the annual defense budget to stabilize public finances and halt a snowballing market route. The influential Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that Chancellor Quasi Quartang will need to find savings of at least $66 billion to shore up confidence by the time he presents his fiscal plan on October 31st. And former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two of his U.S.-based colleagues have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for their research into banking and financial crises. Douglas Diamond, Philip DeVig, and Bernanke will share the $885,000 award. By honoring Bernanke, the Prize Committee took the unusual step of recognizing an actual practitioner of economic policy.

Thanks, Simone. Let's get you a bit of a preview of what's to come. We're going to get an assessment of Egypt and other regional economies that's going to be with the FIM partners, Henny Ben-Malooka. Plus we speak with the CEO of Saudi electronics retailer, Extra Mohammed Glell. But first, we're going to discuss the global macro picture with UBPs, Eleanor Taylor, Julya, Sinflation, and geopolitics way on markets. This is Bloomberg. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a trixute empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it and building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. I didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the crowd. I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the crowd and do by machine what should be done by hand.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1703,2022-10-11 04:18:42
13478," So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade we did see some pressure on the U.N. we did see some pressure on the futures that is now being reversed. We're starting to see the effect on some sectors but it's going to take some time for that cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and for inflation to come down and of course uncertainty is high so I'm paying close attention to global risk. Front loading was a good thing given how far below normal neutral rates were but overshooting is costly too and there's a great uncertainty about how restrictive policy must actually become. Fett vice chair Leo Breanor and the Chicago Fed president Charles Evans both laying out the case for caution when it comes to monetary tightening. Chip stocks are driving losses the meantime across equity markets is the IMF and the World Bank War and about the global economy meanwhile you've got JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon saying the U.S. could fall into recession in the next six to nine months and the S&P 5400 could plunge another 20% let's break it all down with Eleanor Taylor, July and the co head of Swiss and Global Equity at Union Bank here at Privet. Let's start off with some of the Fed verbatim. Are you a believer in a potential moderation of tone as we are closer to the end of the year before maybe something breaks on a larger scale in terms of stability and cohesion. In the book about such a that is it depends on the data I would see a continuation of the path which is still indeed because we started from a very low rate quite a long way away from the levels of inflation that we're seeing at the moment. Were we to see indeed a faster reaction on one of the data points linked to the rates actually beginning to have an effect we might see a change in the in the past but I don't think it's being called for at the moment. One area where we are seeing a lot of turmoil and a lot of pain is in the United Kingdom and the bond markets over there once again front and center in the last few hours. Scott Minard from Guggenheim is waiting on this this morning and he tweeted out the following he says financial crisis returns as UK guilds collapsed to pre-intervention levels of last week putting pressure on US rates as risk rises for global market turmoil and increasing the probability of a coordinated policy response what could a coordinated response look like. It's very difficult to imagine because we're after the great financial crisis I think one could argue that there was a coordinated response and the global economy was more or less in a similar place across the world. This time around we have not had a multilateral response or this time there seems to be a stronger emphasis on countries and regions going it alone and also countries and regions are in a different place from each other and that does mean that we have different tensions affecting different parts of the world Europe in terms of fragmentation risks which are still around and the UK now more independent but also facing much more political intervention with changes of governance changes of directions which is a source of uncertainty for the market. So what does your current strategy look like when it comes to a global portfolio I mean are you staying defensive what kind of percentages are we talking about in terms of exposure. So we look very much from a stock picking point of view as opposed to from a sector allocation point of view but certainly we are bearing in mind that we expect the consumer to be under considerable pressure in the next.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1704,2022-10-11 04:23:09
13479," a sector allocation point of view, but certainly we are bearing in mind that we expect the consumer to be under considerable pressure in the near term linked in part, notably in Europe, to the higher energy costs and also to the fact that those savings which had been built up during the pandemic, which had been supported during the pandemic as well with fiscal interventions and different parts of the world have probably now got close to being used up and we do see a need for a number of consumers and an expectation that they will have to start being much cautious about their spending. So we're certainly avoiding the discretionary space. We're also concerned that some staples may be optically less defensive than they might appear as people trade down from some of the margin rich products that you see in the staples space, but on the other hand we think that there may be some areas of the industrial space which will become of more relevant as people seek different ways of reducing their energy consumption and also ways of saving on more materials as those prices increase. Some of the biggest buyers of treasuries have been bailing at roughly the same time, a trending story on the terminal. As we see yields for US tens once again hover around the 4% mark, are we going to see a more substantial overshoot and perhaps more relevant to your specific strengths? How does that affect the selling point of equities when you've got such a large offering on yields, especially with potentially inflation coming down? People say no to try and bet against the bond market, don't they? I think that's a well-known sentiment. If one invests long term in equity, one has a tendency to be looking much more at the side of what value creation can be carried out by the companies which sit behind the equity as opposed to looking at asset allocation between different asset classes. But an unstable bond market creates uncertainty for companies, high yields may in some cases, the companies which have weaker balance sheets mean that we have to start considering the cost of debt more closely. And obviously we need to consider where the equity risk premium is and what kind of price that we're prepared to pay for equity. But I think one should remember that this current difficulty that we are in at the moment is not as a result of something systemic which has happened on the market. We are in a situation where there is going to be tightening from central banks where companies are actually coming into it in a relatively healthy situation. I don't know, it's been great catching up. I appreciate the insights that's Eleno Taylor, July in the co-head of Swiss and Global Equity at Union Bonquierre Preve. So much more to come on the show. This is Bloomberg. Music COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. What can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic and one of the changes I think David has been in change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1705,2022-10-11 04:27:22
13480," obidot office, they're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will, because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. Let's get you a bit of an overview of how Middle East markets performed. You've got a broadly negative picture tracking some of the sentiment in other parts of the world. So on the Dubai Index, we're done about 1% the culprit there. If you want to call it that was a 2.7% fall in the blue chip play, EMAR properties. Also Dubai investments got hit quite hard. Concerns about a global slowdown. In Al-Budabi a little bit of a less negative picture. In the Tadau, we saw a bit of a defense of the 11,500 point mark. Of course, a lot to factor in as oil prices remain firm and firmly supported by OPEC plus policy. I want to get to a line crossing the Bloomberg. We were talking about treasuries at the beginning of the show with Eleanor, Julyden, from UBP as well, and now your two-year yield reaches a new level. Something we haven't seen since August of 2007, 4.34 for U.S. two-year yields. That as U.S. ten-year yields continue to hover just below the 4% mark. Are they going to overshoot before they normalize? What kind of commentary does the Fed need to provide over the coming days to try and manage what looked like increasing risks of global financial disruption? This is Bloomberg. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. It's just honest, we've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears moment.

13481," is a young individual. With your always, always learning. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ This is Lumic Daybreak Middle East. Our top stories this morning. The case? For caution, Ben Vice Chair, Leal Brainard, outlines reasons to be careful as the central bank raises rates to curb high inflation. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a data dependent manner, will enable us to learn how economic activity, employment, and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessment of the path of the policy rate. Meanwhile, there's a risk off mood that's hit the markets as the IMF and World Bank ward of rising risks of a global recession, with potential of $4 trillion of lost output through 2026. As the war in Ukraine intensifies, the ruler of the United Arab Emirates travels to Russia today to meet with President Putin. And UK-Bahn set off deepens as lawmakers returned to parliament later for the first time since quasi-cortez mini-budget wrecked havoc. Let's circle back then on how the markets are fairing in Asia. Julie, it's not only has those updates from our Singaporeans, so do they. The next tools. Hey, Yusuf, a very bad day indeed, as we've seen the regional benchmark index fall by more than 4% over a three-day period. Let's start with the cell if we're seeing in Malaysian assets, though, because we just spoke about the fact that parliament has been dissolved there. So you are seeing the Malaysian market down by about 1.5% the ring at falling by about 1.5% against the dollar, too. But it is, again, this concern about renewed US China tensions and the curbs on the chip sector that is weighing into the market and we had Taiwan on a holiday yesterday. So it has resumed trade and fallen by 4.2% to November 2020 lows and seeing some significant selling in the likes of TSMC, which opened lower by more than 7%. And we know it's going to come through with earnings later this week as well. We've also got Japan and South Korea playing catch up because they were closed yesterday, too, so significant selling coming through in those markets, both off by about 2.3 to 2.5%. And when it comes to the overall FX picture, it still is a dollar strength story. We have the PBOC trying to defend the U.N. weakness once again with a 29th day of a stronger than expected fix. But you can see weakness coming through in both the on and off shore U.N. today. And continuing to see a sell-off in bonds as well. Some significant moves coming through in yields across the region. Have a look particularly at Indonesia, the 30-year yield there up by some 25 basis points, you sir. I want to get to the wipe-up we're seeing in the market capitalization of some of the chip stocks. What have analysts been writing about in terms of the latest curves and the impact? Yeah, well, of course, just as we hope that things were getting better between Beijing and Washington over the overall chip space, it does seem to be another headwind and Morgan Stanley coming through saying not surprisingly that this is going to be very disruptive. Bernstein had already said that the escalation carries risk over retaliation. Morgan Stanley saying that they had expected most of the restrictions on graphics and equipment sales to China sovereign customers, but there appears to be a broadened scope here. So that is going to hurt a number of the players. They're also saying it creates some risks for firms in the compute supply chain in the first half of next year. So they're looking at Intel, AMD and Vitya. But they do say the impact on SMIC, which of course is listed in Hong Kong could be minimal. We have seen some shares down by 2.3% in the morning session. And as I mentioned, significant weakness in those chip players that were closed yesterday. So TSMC shares now down by some 8% in Taiwan, Yuzuf. Yeah, absolutely astounding moves there for TSMC, given the scale of this company, incredible size. Jules, thank you for that. Truly, it's all there with a deeper level analysis of some of the movements in the markets in Asia. I want to get to the UAE president, Namahab bin Zayt and Nihyan. He's going to travel to Russia in the coming hours to meet with his counterpart, Vladimir Putin. It's according to the state run news agency from the UAE side. The visit comes as the Russian president threatens more missile attacks on Ukraine after hitting Kiev and other cities. Simone Foxman has more. So Simone, what are some of the items on the agenda?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1707,2022-10-11 04:36:32
13482," The Russian President threatens more missile attacks on Ukraine after hitting Kiev and other cities. Simone Foxman has more. So Simone, what are some of the items on the agenda that have come through? Well, I mean, certainly we believe that the conflict in Ukraine is something that the two will discuss. But there was a pretty generic statement out of the UAE State run at news agency. There's clearly the hope here and that was said by a former finance minister on Twitter that this meeting could help defuse the war in Ukraine, essentially defuse a European war. I think tangible evidence that that will happen still remains unlikely. You know, we've seen a real increase in the kind of involvement that many players, the UAE among them, have really had in this ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Yes, oil prices are helping their bottom line, but ultimately countries like the Emirates are stuck between two major important strategic powers. For the UAE, they face ongoing scrutiny about lack of imposition of sanctions. There's a lot of Russian money flowing into the country, and that's something that gets raised by partners like the United States. Similar reasons we saw the country emir. All Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, apparently those two had a chat about the international situation and what more they could do at the UN venue. The Saudi UAE Turkey involved in prisoner swaps. We'll see what comes from this meeting today. I think expectations are low, even if hopes are high. Yeah, I would never discount a potential surprise with the United States. They have surprised in the past, including when they normalize relations with Israel. In the meantime, the U.S. Senator has urged a freeze on all cooperation with Saudi Arabia. It's a pretty significant development given some of the arms deals that are in existence. Yeah, this New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, this isn't the first time that he's pursuing policies to try and freeze arms sales to Saudi Arabia in particular, and also occasionally the UAE. But difference is what's happening here is just who's sitting in the presidency because these moves were particularly prominent under the presidency of Donald Trump. But now that we have a Biden administration in office and a Biden administration that's seemingly a little less happy with Saudi Arabia over just the past couple of weeks, we're seeing a higher potential for some of these policies to potentially go through. And so Menendez here calling for the end of any cooperation with Saudi Arabia until it reassesses its position with respect to the war in Ukraine, so tying the Saudi oil move to what's happening in broader U.S. policy. This isn't actually the only thing that's going on that we have to pay attention to from Washington. Congressman's bipartisan group of congressmen are now pushing for a bill called NOPEC, which would cause the U.S. Department of Justice to potentially file suit to break up the OPEC plus cartel. That could have an impact even just if this legislation moves forward a little bit. And then briefly on Q&B, they kicked off earnings season yesterday, or some of the highlights. Yeah, a profit for the nine month period, rising 7 percent, but we saw a pretty sharp decline in these share price after these numbers were reported. And that may be because investors expected we'd see a net income of about 14 billion QAR, and instead they got 11 billion QAR for the period. Other important things to watch, asset growth, rising about 5 percent. That's something we pay a lot of attention to. We'll be looking at long growth as well. We saw an NPL is not performing loans relatively stable in the books, so that's maybe a positive sign for investors. We'll hopefully get more details on this, more details on the drag that Turkey is also having on the bank when we hear their earnings call on October 12th. Simone, thank you very much. Really appreciate it. That's Simone Foxman at the Cuddlefinaster Center in Doha. I want to get to the inflation numbers in the urban parts of Egypt because they accelerated at the fastest pace last month in almost four years. And it's the latest sign. Making small numbers. There's a really middle line.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1708,2022-10-11 04:40:40
13483," I want to get to the inflation numbers in urban parts of Egypt because they accelerated at the fastest pace last month in almost four years. And it's the latest sign of consumers in the most popular Arab country can expect little respite from higher costs after weeks of the clients in the pound. The consumer price is climbed an annual 15% in September that compares with 14.6% the previous month. Let's get to ahead even Malooka. He's the founder and CEO at Fem partners. He joins us here around the said. These numbers just make it really complicated for the central bank. I look at what's happening with the local currency and we are on a glide path. It's just inch by inch chip by chip. Where is it going to level out eventually and are we going to get a deal immediately with the IMF? Yes. So look, the picture from my perspective for Egypt is not as bleak as it looks. The reason for that is that ultimately we are replacing hot money which was going to T-bills with more sustainable funding paths. So you have better FDIs into the country. Tourism is doing much better. Remittances are remaining solid and revenue from Suez Canal as well are up and likely to be even higher. In the short term, the biggest challenge for Egypt from my perspective is in this current environment you have obviously food costs is increasing and Egypt is a big importer. So that will feed into inflation and will continue to do so. But also the biggest challenge for Egypt is it's essentially shut from the capital market for raising long term debt. So bottom line what's going to happen in my view, very simple playbook, you need an IMF deal. You will have support from friendly countries, most probably GCC. You raise rates to avoid the dollarization of the economy and you sell through the... So you raise rates but what do you do with the currency? Where would you like to see it get weakened to? What have your people been telling you within the research team? Look. Twenty one, twenty two, year end. What would you like to see? My perspective should not devalue too much, should go to twenty two, twenty three, ten to fifteen percent devaluation. You don't want to feed the inflationary loop but it may shoot up a bit more. My sense is once and for all Egypt needs to let its currency float which it has not done in the last cycle. Okay, let's talk about some of the recessionary risks around the world. We were hearing from Jamie Diamond earlier saying three to six months there is a chorus of voices that are putting some very serious warnings out. This part of the world so far has been relatively insulated, run me through what's top of mine as we get to year end. Look, you're right, the GCC for now is very well positioned, right? It's doing extremely well, higher oil prices but also macro pictures extremely solid in general. My view is that this is not going to last. You cannot be insulated so higher costs of that strong dollar inflation in pleasure globally will catch up with the region and we will see slow down in the economy. We will see also probably not a recession but definitely slow down in the economy in twenty twenty twenty twenty four miles. Oil prices in my view will also correct a bit from where they are today. Any research which you've shared with us, you've constructed a table and we've taken some of the highlights from that talks about Saudi Arabia, the fiscal break events and also some of the expenditure coverage and how that's been shrinking. What is the message that investors should take with them? Look, the message is very clear. I think the GCC countries have learned from the past. They are a lot more conservative setting their budgets. They are building buffers for slow down and for recession. This is clear to me so if we go into a recession in my view we will globally. This region will be best positioned for that. However, people should not expect counter-cyclical spending in this region that will take it to level where we don't feel anything here. That's not going to happen. Okay, and we're looking here at the table, both at the break.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1709,2022-10-11 04:44:51
13484," Counter-cyclical spending in this region that will take it to level where we don't feel anything here. That's not going to happen. Okay, and we're looking here at the table, both the break-even prices over the next five years and the expenditure coverage, which has been shrinking 2022 estimate at just 18 months for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. What about the IPO craze here? And you're not really buying into that, or at least you're very cautious on it. Does that apply to anything and everywhere right now out of the Gulf? It's coming to an end, you see. This is it. You know, we probably will have a few more. And after that, I expected to definitely slow down. What you've been promising investors is high dividend yields and guaranteed dividend yields of 5-6%. But that's no longer attractive. That's the reality of things. You get it investing in investment grade. You buy Citibank bonds and you get paid six times. You're buying them. Maybe you're buying them. But what I meant is what is perceived to be the least risky pays you 6% or 7% for two, three years duration. Why would you venture into equities for potentially the same dividend yield? So I think, look, liquid is going to dry up. The opportunity cost is increasing with higher interest rates. And in my view, that's going to slow down dramatically the IPO craze. And actually, the picture of the development of capital markets in the region, there is definitely a commitment in Saudi and UAE, other GCC country to continue to develop. So the structural story in my view is intact. But short term, it will slow down. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty difficult to determine the risk free assets these days. I mean, you see what's happening with the benchmark. You are Treasury yields as we speak. That's right. In any case, great getting you here on the program, Heidi. Doesn't have to be every three years. And I didn't even look at he's the founder and CIO at FIM Partners. What's more to come? This is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That's great question. Great question. Great question. That's a question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts. Great questions. The Saudi electronics retailer, Extra, fell more than 3% yesterday as a reported third quarter earnings. The operating profit rose 5.7% year on year, revenue stayed flat at 1.37 billion Saudi reels. The manager director and CEO, Hamid Ghele, joins us now. Hamid, I was reading through some of the analyst reactions to the earnings announcement and what crystallized to me was an increase in operating expenses, especially marketing. How are you going to manage that cost going into year end? First of all, good morning. I would like to talk about the expectation that we sent for the marketing. In the results for quarter three, it's significant in our opinion because we were expecting much worth results than this. Number one, because of the inflation that's happening in the food sector. Number two, also the entertainment. If you look to the peak point of sale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1710,2022-10-11 04:49:48
13485," Number one, because of the inflation that's happening in the food sector. Number two, also the entertainment. The entertainment, if you look to the point of sale data, you will find that for the same period versus last year, it was plus 21% while the consumer electronics market is minus 8.5% year to date. Number three, that was the first time since three years that the Saudi will allow to really travel. And so the third quarter was really very challenging. And so we did our best to come safe out of this. And we succeeded. And so we came flat in a declining market with an improved profit of 5%. We have a fairly certain philosophy regarding the cost and investment. And this is very important, you see. I think when the time gets tough, this is the time to invest, not the time to get spending. Because usually we invest in the future initiatives, which will bring us a lot of living your own profit in the future. So you don't feel the need to step in and bring down costs because of higher inflationary pressure, be it on the labor side or on the supply chain side. Now the supply chain side, this is a very, let's say, a misread story, currently there is no supply chain challenges. Actually, there is an offering inventory within the company because of the slow demand in Europe and the US. And most of the company, if you've seen LG and Samsung, they announced results and we have over inventory. And so the prices will go down whether in the inventory is much high. And the supply chain and the transportation cost is going down. And so that's a very good sign. On the other side, our investment mainly is coming in technology and digitalizing the company, the tech part of the consumer finance. And I can tell you freely, we are the only tech company making money in the region. And so we are continuing to invest in the future. Bahamad, I'm looking at the relative resilience of the Gulf at the moment, in terms of the macroeconomic performance that is supported by oil exports revenue that continues to rise. What about on a consumer level? What are you seeing in terms of your customers? Are they changing how they are spending their money, are they becoming more cautious? Or are they also still in a relative bubble vis-à-vis, you know, the US and Europe? No, look at number one, regarding the Gulf, there is what I call it, a new norm now. There is a fundamental change of structure in the market itself. Because women going into the market, with this move, you will find the household number will be much smaller than before the sizes of the house is going down. People become more rational in terms of their spending. And so there is a structure that changes currently happening. And we need to really cope with the new norm, because this is not like a crisis or a wave that will go. And we need to cope with this type of norm. And how extra is doing this? We are only the company available in 30 cities. We have the number one in the channel in the region, our online business is 20% of our business. And so you buy it at the time that you want, you pay as you want, and at the same time you pick it up from any place. This is the new definition of convenience for these companies. So I want to build on that footprint that you just described. You talk about investing, being contrarian, stepping into the market when others are stepping away. Where does it leave you with your presence in Egypt and other potential new markets? Egypt is a very important project for us. It's 100 million, a plus 100 million population. In terms of size, it's the equivalent to Saudi almost. So it's about 25 billion real equivalent to market size. We already have established an office over there. We should be operating in the first half, end of the first half, next year.

13486," We established an office over there. We should be operating in the first half, end of the first half next year. We finished the go-to-market strategy and we are very serious about the, our going into Egypt. You know, we always think about the mint and the loan to short term for us is really something that we care to deliver results in the short term. However, always our eye on the future and the vision and what can, how can we keep growing a specific double digit growth on the bottom line? I mean, from what you're outlining, quite a few promising fronts for the company. I mean, I look at the stock price, though, Muhammad, and it's underperformed the benchmark to Dowell by quite a margin, double digits. Where do you think the disconnect is between the pricing and between what you are actually trying to deliver to investors? Look, usually I say this, our role in me and the management team is to manage the company and not to manage the stock. The stock is, as you know, the share price is due to macroeconomics, the retail psychology, a lot of things that they are doing. And so our role really is to manage the company and to keep sustainability and at the same time, delivering the double digit growth, as I said, on terms of bottom line. And the price is the mechanics of the market itself. I cannot control that, sorry. How about there? We'll definitely continue to catch up in future earnings announcements. Thank you very much for the insights. Great to see Muhammad Galele, he's the extra managing director and CEO, one of the key retailers in the kingdom. Let's get to the UK now, because lawmakers are returning to parliament later for the first time since quasi-quartengues, mini-budgeted announcement. Since then, the pound touched a record low against the dollar, the Bank of England, and the government had to intervene in the guild market. And on top of all of that, government was forced into a U-turn over its signature tax cut. Let's head out on a key date like this, Bloomberg's Leigh Ann Garen's, now London headquarters, so Leigh Ann, it's our few weeks. What are we expected today? So parliament is back in business today, UCF, and after you just mentioned after the pound plummeted after that mini-budget, and after the really fractious conservative party conference that we saw. So, to 30 today, that all kicks off, and we expect the chancellor, quasi-quarteng, to be answering treasurary questions. Now, this is the first time he would have faced MP since that mini-budget, since the U-turn, as you just mentioned, on that income tax cut for the highest earners here in the UK. And this is going to be a time that we're going to see what the chancellor has to say about the mini-budget, and if he really does stick to the script. Yesterday, there was actually another U-turn, UCF. I don't know if you noticed, but the government said they were going to bring their fiscal statement forward by three weeks. The chancellor originally insisting that that would happen at the end of November. Now we know that's going to happen before the BoE rapes decision. So, at least that's kind of good news. As central bankers will know what they're expecting. And Bloomberg's very own Kitty Donaldson has said that quasi-quarteng and Liz Truss are going to be on a major charm offensive. Yeah, I'm glad to see that the bank of England and the governor appear to be finally sharing some of their items in the calendar. Meanwhile, it calls this morning for the UK to massively slash public spending. What's that about? So, this is from an independent economic think tank here in the UK, which has lots of credibility. And that's the IFS. And today they've come up with an economic look ahead, which says the government is really going to have to cut and find 60 billion pounds. And this will be to fund what the chancellor has laid out in that mini budget that we saw, that tax-cutting agenda. And it was saying that what the Institute for Fiscal Study says the government's boring is set to hit nearly 200 billion pounds this year, which is huge amounts of money. And they're saying the way that the chancellor is going to have to fund this deep hole that we are seeing is by carrying out cuts, cuts to public services. And we have seen lately that there's another flashpoint brewing within the government. And this is all about benefit.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1712,2022-10-11 04:58:03
13487," I carry out cuts, cuts to public services and we have seen lately that there's another flashpoint brewing within the government and this is all about benefits. It's about if benefits should be increased in line with inflation or increased in line with earnings to save money. So we're going to see how that plays out in the next few weeks. But more U-turns possibly on the agenda, you, Seth. Yeah, Leanne and we'll continue, of course, to check back in with you throughout the process. This is Leanne Garenz in London. I want to get back to the equity markets for you. A bit of a flavor of the negative price direction. About six tenths of one percent on the S&P 500 mini, we are concerned or the markets concerned about geopolitics rising tensions vis-à-vis Russia, Ukraine and then of course the inflation recession angst, Bank of America flagging that earnings guidance is going to be terrible as we wait important numbers out from the big banks late in the week on. If the board gets to the treasuries because US 10's rising 10 bips, you've got US 2's at key levels. Once more ahead, this is Bloomberg. So the inflation environment has been changing a little bit. Inflation has been very low for 25 years. Now people think inflation is coming back. How are you going to deal with that? I think many of the tools that we've historically used to battle inflation no longer work in the same ways they used to. I think people oftentimes thought of housing as a way or especially retail and real estate as a way to hedge against inflation less and less possible the way we've invested in it. I think commodity similarly have been thought of as a way to hedge against inflation. Their challenges over the long-term equities have been a hedge against inflation. We will continue to do what we have done in the past which is to build a diversified portfolio where there are many different opportunities that have the possibility of hedging against inflation because different types of inflation have to be hedged in different ways. So if it's a very quick increase in inflation as opposed to a slow rise of inflation, is it temporary? Is it a long and persistent type of inflation? So for us, I never model myself an economist that can predict where inflation is going. So what I need to do is build a diversified portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation and to pay close attention to it. Fundamentally, we've done through the equity markets. This is Bloomberg, David Europe. I'm Tom McKenzie here in London with Manuscrani.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1713,2022-10-11 05:01:59
13488," This is Bloomberg, David Europe. I'm Tom McKenzie here in London with Manus Cranny in Istanbul and these are the stories that set your agenda. Inflation angst, 30-year treasury yields reached the highest since 2014 following yesterday's move in GILTS as price concerns deepen. Tech stocks lead Asian stocks lower as trade begins. Join borrowing Germany will back a common issuance of EU debt to cushion the blow of the energy crisis with conditions. Plus Joe Biden pledges to provide Ukraine with advanced defense systems as Vladimir Putin threatens more attacks. Good morning, we're still on tour in Istanbul. We've got our capital markets for them. I suppose the bond markets will make it into those conversations. But we had Varshock won on budget day on the 23rd. We've had Varshock too. Let's take a look, Tom, at what happened in the GILTS market yesterday. A death charge exploded in the GILTS again. You saw tenure paper explode by 33 basis points. You're seeing the tenure inflation linkers up by the most on records since 1994. There is a lack of faith in quasi-quartying. There's still a lack of faith in terms of the fiscal probity of this government. And the Bank of England, they extended their emergency backstop. But it wasn't enough to settle the GILTS market, Tom. And absent of another pivot, they're going to need to find nearly 60 billion of spending cuts to write the GILTS market. So, Tom, there you go. This is about Varshock 2. Manus, it was remarkable to watch that, Celif, once again, in UK GILTS. As you say, at one point, of course, the tenure off by about 30 basis points in terms of the move. Hi, we had Jordan Rochester from New Murat on the afternoon show. He expects the pound to get to parity. This is all about that economic recession concern, the concerns around energy here in the UK. And again, the mismatch between the markets and what the chance, as you say, has been doing. In terms of the US and the close there, again, the fourth day of closing in the red stateside. And the futures are pointing to further red on the screen. As we digest comments from the likes of Leo Breinard saying, we have to wait and see and take into account that there is going to be a lot of lag in terms of rate heights and how that affects the economy also pointing to those global risks. But Goldman Sachs saying, this is not the time to bet on a Fed pivot. They are still short equities. You're looking at S&P futures down by 6.10 of percent. Euro stocks futures here as well. In Europe looking lower by 6.10 of a percent. We did end lower by about 2.10. Yesterday across the benchmark, it was a bit of a mixed picture towards the end of the session. A little bit of optimism came through in the German stocks on the back of these expectations. And maybe there's going to be some subsidised around the energy space there. But nonetheless, it is the geopolitics, it is the concern about rate rises and the prospects of recession that really weighed on markets yesterday. A couple of individual corporate stories to bring to your attention. You saw a decent rally in Renault on the back of the news that Nissan, of course, it's a long time partner about two decades, is going to be investing up to 750 million euros or dollars, I should say, in that company's EV business and again, expectations that maybe Renault is going to pair its shareholding in Nissan. BASF gained a good 6 percent again on the back of the news that they could be looking at about 100 billion euros worth of subsidies for the energy space for households and businesses. That is the recommendation of an expert panel in Germany. You saw the chemical producers, the likes of BASF gaining on the back of that manus. And of course, Ben Bernanke, who's just been annoyed at his noble laureate, warning, of course, a great crisis at noble laureate. Financial problems don't begin with an episode, but an episode builds over time. And you don't need to tame inflation in six months. So I think that's a pressing warning to the market, Tom. Let's bring in the team that are around the world. Valerie Tytel is in London breaking down. The further part of the move in the bond markets while Maria today is in Brussels to talk about the EU energy funds. And Rosmatterson is going to give us the latest on that Russian escalation in Ukraine. Gillette Siley will talk chips and Asian markets. Well, let's talk about those depth changes in the bond market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1714,2022-10-11 05:06:44
13489," Russian escalation in Ukraine. Gillette Sali will talk chips and Asian markets. Well, let's talk about those depth changes in the bond markets. The repercussions of the guilt explosion yesterday. Let's get to Valerie. She has the global impact as investors are getting ready to really absorb any more data. Valerie, put this in context for us. Yeah, it's coming in every morning on the edge of my seat, Manus. This market, it feels like it's about to break. We saw a huge volatility in the guilt market yesterday as you were speaking to. And look, the guilt market isn't small. It's a $2 trillion bond market that is failing to function for over a week now. And the longer this goes on, the more market will get nervous about it spreading. So, other assets, BTPs, for example, or the treasury market. We saw the treasury market react overnight, 30-year yields or 10 basis points higher. And look, the longer this crisis goes on in the UK, the more we're worried about it spreading to other assets. We're showing a chart here about bond liquidity. As you can see, liquidity is worsening, not just in the UK, but it's Italy, it's in treasuries, and it's in Germany. And over and over again, this is going to come back to bite the markets. Yeah, it was really interesting to see the spread between Italian debts and German debt actually tightened. You saw that sell off in German debt, but actually a bit of a bid for Italian debt on the back of that news around potentially joint issuance and debts. So, that was a really interesting dynamic as well. Value title, of course, breaking down at the market components, particularly when it comes to fixed income. Thank you. Now, German Chancellor Olaf Schultz will reverse a steadfast German position and support the issuance of EU debt, as I mentioned, to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. A Bloomberg scoop shows that the pivot, however, comes with strings attached for more. We go to our European correspondent, Maria Tadeau, in Brussels, Maria, Germany. This seems to quite a turnaround from us, who have not been necessarily in the weeds on all of this. You have, Germany open to joint debt, but these are loans and not grants, and that's important. And that is the key here, Tom, and it comes with strings attached, and we should make it very clear, this is not a repeat of the 2020 recovery fund. That was a European institution. So, I'm sure you remember that. This was the instrument to deal with the fallout of the pandemic, went to the market, fundraisers of about 750 billion euros, that then were paid out in grants and loans. Now, at this point, we're not talking about grants. This is just credit. The European institutions, which, by the way, are AAA rating, so you see that, of course, they could get a better funding cost than a country. Like, let's say Italy in the market would tap that, get the money and distribute that to member states, but they will have to pay it back, and it's usual. If you get money from European institutions, there are conditions that come attached. Now, the key here, and this is really where we're at, is that this is about funding and locking in the borrowing cost for a country, like Italy, but also across the periphery. If you have to pay back, well, Dad, or if you have to get a debt to deal with this energy crisis, you want to do it at the best rate possible. This is what the plan that the German Chancellor is contemplating, but I should also note, because there's another nuance here. Germany is a big country. It is a big power player, but as you know, very well, every decision in the EU has to be taken unanimously. And yesterday, when I spoke with the Dutch Finance Minister, she told me she didn't see a need for new instruments. So this is a story that is going to play out, I'm sure, for the next few weeks. But of course, Maria, the critical thing is this, when those pandemic funds were launched, we were in deeply, deeply lower rates. And so we are in a very structurally different market now, where the competition in the bond market is hard and heavy. So it's going to be expensive to do this and structurally very different. They'll have to pay up and look large. Maria, great reporting on the German pivot Maria today in Brussels. Well, the US President Joe Biden has condemned what he calls the utter brutality of the Russian missile strikes across Ukraine. That's about a mid-poudin warrants of more attacks. Several cities, including Kiev, were hit by a barrage yesterday, killing at least 11 people and wounding over 60. The strikes came after Putin blamed Ukraine for an attack on a bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Let's get to Blumberg executive editor for International Government, it's Ross Matheson. Ross, the timing of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1715,2022-10-11 05:11:07
13490," Crimea to Russia. Let's get to Bloomberg executive editor for international government. It's Ross, Matheson, Ross the timing of this. I mean, it's an escalation over three days. Are we at some kind of a turning point in this war? Well, it really does show us the trajectory that this war is on. Of course, it comes as Vladimir Putin suffers severe setbacks on the ground. And it's not just about the bridge that you mentioned, linking Crimea, although that was a personal prestige blow for him. Ukrainian troops have retaken territory in the east and are certainly pushing forward in the south. And so his troops are bogged down they're struggling. He's announced annexations. He's announced mobilizations of Russian reservists at home. And he's really in a corner at this point. And we can see that the missile attacks that were conducted yesterday draw widespread praise amongst hardliners in Russia. And certainly they're simply pushing him if anything to escalate to do more. And the message in all of this is that Vladimir Putin is not going to de-escalate in Ukraine. In fact, he's going to dig in on his goals, which is to sustain the territory he's got, if not to take anymore, but certainly not backing down. So is this the playbook, Ros, that he's going to be following in the weeks and months ahead? What options does he have left at this point? Well, that's right, because he's not getting anywhere on the ground. And as we turn to winter, the terrain in Ukraine gets very, very muddy. You see, you can see a scenario where we have Ukrainian troops on one side, Russian troops on the other, basically lobbying ordnance at each other, but unable to really make serious ground. And in that case, what does Vladimir Putin do? He continues to use missiles to target infrastructure in Ukraine in key cities. And showing he can actually still hit across Ukraine from Kiev to live in the far west, of course, Odessa in the south, just trying to cause disruption for Ukrainian people. And obviously, the other thing he can do is continue to hit things that turn off the power for Ukrainians in winter that deprived them of electricity, because what he wants to do is where the people of Ukraine down. Hence the need. As Zelensky has said, the President, of course, of Ukraine calling for more air defenses. And we'll see if that comes through from the US and others. Ros, Madison, Executive Editor for International government. Thank you very much indeed on the latest on what looks like that retaliation then from Russia to the cities across the Ukraine with those missile strikes. Now, Asian stocks remain under pressure as the Biden administration's curbs on Chinese access to US semiconductor technology. Ways and continues to weigh on chip makers. Let's get the latest thing with Gillette Siley in Singapore. Jules. Hey, Tom. Yeah, Bloomberg opinion columnist Tim Colpin saying the chip sector didn't need another excuse to be sold off, but Biden has given them one anyway. And we've seen $240 billion white off this sector globally since these renewed US US China tensions really weighing into market sentiment. Remember as well, we had Taiwan, Japan and South Korea closed yesterday. So when they came back online today, we're seeing significant selling TSM C shares actually falling the most on record in today. That's got the tie X at November 2020 lows. We've got the Hang Seng tech index at January 2019 levels. We were hoping there would be some upside in the reopening theme in Japan. We've borders opening for the first time in more in almost three years. You have seen a little bit of that, but of course that's been priced in. And instead we are seeing this sell off continue to weigh on the Nikkei 2 down by about 2.6%. And if we flip the board, we continue to see weakness coming through in Japan's economy as well, because we actually saw a second month of the current account deficit fall below zero. And this is the biggest consecutive decline going back to 1996, really just showing manners. The impact of the week, yen on imports and painting a bleaker picture for Japan's economy amidst these global recession fears. So that's the end of the year. Manus. Jules apparently the targeting Gen Z for the tourism push. I just leave you with that thought. I don't think I qualify not you and me. And Jules in Singapore get your tickets to Japan. Tom Tom coming up with Tom myself. We're going to chat to cute juke chief FX strategist at such a what does he make of the end Tom. Yeah, plenty more coming up the course will get those insights from Kit juks again on a pound as well after that route in the guild markets. We heard again from Jordan Roaches, their new Murray S I sang he sees parity by the end of the year will see if Kit juks agree.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1716,2022-10-11 05:15:37
13491," The clause will get those insights from Kitchuks again on a pound as well after that route in the guild markets. We heard again from Jordan Rochester of New America yesterday saying he sees parity by the end of the year. We'll see if Kitchuks agrees this is broom bud. China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a longstanding pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. We're starting to see the effect on some sectors, but it's going to take some time for that cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and for inflation to come down. And of course uncertainty is high, so I'm paying close attention to global risk. Over the past few months we've heard more reports from our business and community contacts of reduced job turnover and that summer finding it easier to attract qualified workers. These are signs that some of the unusual strength and labor demand may be waning. I have Fed Vice-Jailer, Brenner, and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans both seeing the effects of tightening starting to show in the U.S. economy. Yes, and they have a slightly more global perspective, which is interesting. And then of course, fresh from his noble economic's prize, you've got the form of Fed, Joe Bambernanky, remarking that the Fed's inflation target, and the tightening is cycling. This is what he had to say. What should be kept in mind is that an inflation target is a medium-term target. It doesn't have to be met within six months or anything like that. Salatry warning should have been listened to. Kit Jukes is the head of FX strategy over at SOK Jen. He's with Tom and I this morning. We'll come back to Brain Art and Evans in just a moment. Good morning, Mr. Jukes. I think this is a solitary warning of you're about to break something from a man that knows a thing or two about crises, Brenner. What do you make of his chastening of the Fed? You know, it's a medium-term target. You don't need to get there immediately. I think it's interesting, I mean, coming from him. I don't know how the Fed in practice when they meet on the second of November are going to react. That's the problem. Having kind of missed the start of this inflation spike, they feel under a great deal of pressure not to be too casual in their approach to it. And that's why they've laid out this path of effect.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1717,2022-10-11 05:19:31
13492," the two casual in their approach to it. And that's why they've laid out this path of effectively 75 basis points in November and another 50 in December. But when they might have gone too far, when we get around to looking at the history books, but I don't know if they've got the nerve to look at, say, core CPI inflation hit 6.5% this week and start backing off or sounding any other than quite hawkish. Or more particularly, I don't think that sort of pouring, calming oil over the equity and bond markets is particularly how they're going to be looking at the world over the course of the next couple of weeks. Yeah, it's interesting to hear from Leo Brainard as well, of course, the vice chair. Pointing to that and Manus highlighted this, pointing to that global outlook as well, tying that into her commentary, the global risks. And of course, central to those global risks is the strength of the US dollar. But we're nowhere near that plaza-record style agreement. Is that where something potentially breaks? Where are we on the damage of the dollar and the need for the Fed to take this into consideration? It's still not something that's really hurting the US economy that much. And it's still helping fight inflation as far as they can turn. They still have underneath a very strong labor market, the number of jobs available compared to people who want one is sort of that gaps narrowing, but it's still strong. What they have to worry about, I think, is the lag between all the tightening we're getting. But I would say the biggest problem for markets, if anything's near breaking globally, it's not breaking, but the bond market is going to cause all the damage. If we view 4%, for example, just as a stopping off point, and you come back in a week's time and find 10 year-notteal at 4.25%, I think we'll be breaking stuff in a pretty big way. And that's what's going to keep on pushing. So they have to manage that. So a sort of plaza record problem or solution, I would say, is six months more of this maybe it could happen. But in the interim, I think what could start scaring policymakers is if we accelerate bond yields higher in the US but across the board as well, because that's going to get everybody looking at their public finances, the cost of their debt, what it does to the economy and then that gets much more worrying. Get? I'm going to give you a warning. I don't want you to steal our UK thunder. We're going to talk more about the UK and the bond shock in a moment. But I want to put in context. You say, Jamie Diamond says this, the next 100 basis points that will matter in the bond market, that's where the most pain will come. Walk us through the kind of cracks or breaks that come in the next 15, next 75 basis points. If the Fed dare go up that level again, I say dare. What do I know if they go up that trajectory? Well, I think I mean, firstly, at the trajectory day, more or less outlined, we're going to get a further, possibly significant inversion in the curve this side of Christmas. So that's going to make anybody who's looking at the historical relevance of an inverted yield curve start getting the EBGBs in a pretty big way. Secondly, I think everybody's observed this. It's nothing clever about it, that is that we have become incredibly used to the idea that bond yields in particular, the overall cost of funding stays super low. And that as that happens, we've leveraged our whole financial system to it. So what we saw in the UK, where a spike higher in bond yields caused damage in the pension industry, you can get variance of that all the way across the world, just effectively, because we are not used to the idea of, I don't know, a 5% or 10% yield, for example, or anything like that. And you can start creating a very unforeseen damage. OK, and maybe some of those EBGBs as you say, it's something. EBGBs is not something that Manus Cranny suffers from. I should point out. Kit, you can stay up. We'll get your calls, Kit, and all things UK. The sell-off that we saw, that pronounced sell-off in the yields, and of course, your views on the pound as well after the break-head of FX strategy at Sockgen. Also, don't miss our interview with Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester. We're going to get her views on the US economy and the Fed's rate path. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1718,2022-10-11 05:24:14
13493," Fed President Loretta Mesta, we're going to get her views on the U.S. economy and the Fed's right path. This is Brimberg. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Welcome back. Now, UK GILTS sold off again yesterday. Lead by inflation linked notes. This after the BOE's moves to increase emergency bank stock measures failed to reassure the market. Some status meanwhile say they doubt the bank's plan to restart active GILTS sales on October at the 31st. Still with us is Kit Juk's head of FX strategy at SOC Gen. Kit, let's just get your thoughts on the market action yesterday in the UK that sell off in GILTS. The Chancellor brought forward his fiscal plans. We're going to get those almost a month earlier than plan with the OBR to match. And then you had the BOE trying to reassure the markets with that insistence that there will be enough liquidity. And yet we saw this sell off. What's going on? The glib answer is deciding to have effectively a budget on Halloween is too much of an invitation for everybody. But I think you can't, you know, the UK is sort of helps this move in bond yields along but it's not the fundamental driving force of it. Rates are going up inflation is high global growth. You know, it's done that everybody's issuing debt at the same time. So it all feeds on itself. So what sort of part of the issue now as we come into this week is going to be that the big market, the treasury market is pushing along. But yesterday what was happening in the UK was magnified by the announcements in Europe. If we're going to get in one form or another more debt issued in Europe, that sort of adds to it all. And so the UK is in that sense relatively small, but pushing it along. I just think it all keeps it going. We've got two UK. Okay. We've got we've got just two minutes and we want to squeeze in both. Yes, the credibility of the UK, the question is we had a bigger move yesterday than we have on the Varshock in the guilt market 10 two weeks ago. So will there be a reasserting of pressure on sterling assets, particularly in the currency? When do we break parity? I'd be surprised if we break parity in this move because you'd need another shock to confidence. And the market has got itself short.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1719,2022-10-11 05:28:08
13494," And do we break parity? I'd be surprised if we break parity in this move, because you'd need another shock to confidence. The market has got itself short of sterling. A lot of people have used it as it's, really, as the main way to go long of the dollar in recent times. So I don't think we're going to break parity unless we're dragging the euro down with us. But I definitely think the dollar's going up against both of them over time from here still. The market's pricing in at least 100 basis points from the B.O.E. come November 3rd. Can they really be that aggressive? That probably will feel the need to be quite aggressive when you listen to them in the sense that they're revising up their estimates of what they have to do as fast as the government is revising up its spending plan. So the two have to work together. If you're going to get this kind of fiscal large S, at the same time as we've got an inflation problem, the bank probably does feel it has to be pretty aggressive, to be honest. They're going to wreck the economy and the process between them. And we'll have to worry about that down the road. My concern in that sense is, does a 1% move stabilize the foreign exchange market, particularly? Not really. It won't prevent the weakness and the currency. But I wouldn't fall off my chair and surprise if they went more than I expected. KJUKS, stay on that chair. Yields alone will not save your currency. That's one thing that we have learned from the starting market in the past 14 days. KJUKS says, ever thank you for joining Tom and myself out of FFX strategy over at Stockton. Coming up, high frequency economics. Anyone? We have the chief economist, Karl Weinberg, joins us. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. I was just a trix new empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft. And do by machine what should be done by hand. And do by machine what should be done by hand.

Plus Joe Biden pledges to provide Ukraine with advanced air defense systems as Vladimir Putin threatens more attacks. Don't very good morning from Istanbul. We're here for the capital markets for them for Bloomberg more of that in just a moment. But the debt charge in the bond market a quick snapshot for our viewers you covered it last night on the close. You've got a 26 basis point move on budget day 33 basis point move on 10s. Yes, actually, this is var shock to in the guilt market, even though the Bank of England are backstopping the guilt market. It's not enough as quasi-quart time brings forward his fiscal plans. He'll bring that forward to October the 31st. But in the end of the day, the market has a lack of belief in the credibility of this government and the fiscal property to the markets. Oil, the battle lines are drawn between demand angst and opact gains drop by 1.6%. Yes, actually lower this morning, the IMF World Bank, Jamie Diamond, all talking recession. Oil is lower, Aussie is lower on that same story as well. Jamie Diamond, tricks about the next 100 basis points as being the painful level. Aussie dollar also lower, Tom, specifically because of the zero-covid policy in China, which is set to be extended according to the people's daily. And of course, the bond market continuing to react viciously really to the guilt market moves from yesterday evening in US Treasury's Tom. Yeah, and you had four straight days of losses. It looks like the futures are going to bear this out. We're setting ourselves up for a fifth-trade day of losses, of course, a long way to go. In terms of US equities and US stocks, you had Goldman Sachs coming out saying it is not time for the Fed to pivot. Do not bet on that. They remain short versus equities, at least in the short term. So losses on the S&P, E-minis futures, you're looking at losses of 5.10 of a percent. Here in Europe, where you ended the day in the red yesterday, by about 2.10 of a percent, you're pointing to further losses of around 5.10 of a percent. Despite that unity that is coming through around that need for support on the energy crisis, it is loans. It's not grants. That is the importance. But nonetheless, you have the Germans aligning with the Southern Europeans on that front. A couple of individual corporates to bring to your attention. You have the story of Renault Nissan. That continues. We continue to watch any lines that come out as they renegotiate and try and restructure this two-decade alliance. Really, you saw some upside yesterday, four Renault on the back of the announcement that Nissan would be taking or be prepared to invest up to $700 million in their EV unit. Renault is looking potentially to reduce and sell down some of its shareholdings, about 40% stake in Nissan as well. BASF got a bid on the back of the news at an expert panel over in Germany who recommended pretty significant subsidies around energy costs. The chemical maker, the chemical giant, of course, reliant, very reliant on that gas, so getting a bid on the back of that news as well. Let's get the first word news now with Simone Foxman in Dover. Simone. Good morning, Tom. President Vladimir Putin has threatened more strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure after Russian missiles hit cities across the country. U.S. President Joe Biden condemned what he called the utter brutality of the attacks. The most intense since the first days of the invasion. French drivers face more fuel shortages after unions vowed to continue strikes at the country's biggest refineries. President Emmanuel Macron's government is being urged to mediate after the dispute left almost a third of petrol stations with supply shortfalls. Japan has reopened its border today to vaccinated travelers from 68 countries, ending almost three years of pandemic restrictions. With a weekend and relatively low inflation, hopes are high for a rebound in the visitor numbers, as airlines ramp up international flights. Reports have emerged of Iranian oil workers joining protests, which have continued over the death of 22-year-old woman last month in the custody of the so-called morality police.

13496," Unverified social media videos purportedly show dozens of laborers and uniform workers marching. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Manus. Simone, thank you very much. Simone Voxman there at Doha Financial Center. Well, JP Morgan, the JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Dimon says serious headwinds are likely to push the US into a recession by the middle of next year. He was speaking with CMBC, Diamond said Europe is already in a dying turn. And that is likely to put the US in some kind of a recession in the next six to nine months and the heads of the international monetary fund and the World Bank. Well, there's only seminar alarms. The IMF managing director, Chris Salino Georgiva said that higher US rates are starting to bite. And the World Bank president, David Malpass warning a real danger of a worldwide contraction. Let's unpack all of this. We're joined now by Carl Weinberg, chief economist at high frequency economics. Carl, some pretty brutal warnings from the IMF, the World Bank, and drawn much more to Jamie Dimon recession in the US in the next six next six to nine months. There's four and a half percent rates from the Fed deliver a hard landing or just a malifluous kind of slowed on. Well, good morning to you all. I think that the notion of a soft landing is a nice dream, but it's something that in reality central banks have very, very rarely been able to deliver and almost never experience in my career, which goes back many, many years. Central banks have gone after inflation by tightening monetary conditions have generated a recession. That's the only way they have to affect prices that they're going up too high is to cause the economy to contract, to cause demand to shrink relative to supply. So yeah, I think at some point we're going in. The only brave part about Jamie Dimon statement is putting a six to nine month time frame on it because we don't have a really good precise view of when it's going to happen. And it's certainly not happening right now. The cards seem to be on the table. And Carl, part of the calculation, of course, with the Fed in terms of how they react and the implications then for those recession risks will be that data around inflation on Thursday added to the US. What are you seeing that the data that you analyze to suggest and to give you any clarity on the stickiness of these higher prices stateside? What do you expect to see from that print on Thursday? Well, the Fed's not going to find what it wants to see in that inflation number. It's going to see headline come down and we're all going to like that. That's going to be mainly a function of gasoline prices coming down. But when we look at the core elements of the CPI, we're going to see still two high rates of increase of prices that are not coming down very quickly. Combine that with the labor market data which show that the labor market remains tight. We're not seeing the elements that we need to look for the Fed to declare that it's done its job of stabilizing prices. So it'll be a nice report for the markets for a few minutes when they see the headline. But at the end analysis, it won't affect the Fed's trajectory one bit. You're not holding any punches back this morning, Carl. So let's go with the flow. Mike had heartened over at Bank of America the flow show. So we're fleeing to cash like it's 2020. We know that whether it's a short end, short duration or actually cash, you're going to get four, four and a half percent. But it's tempting to be a contrarian ball when there's a bond right and cheaper valuations in stocks. Is it too soon? Okay, I think we've lost the connection with Manus there. He's in Istanbul. This happens sometimes on live TV. We'll try and reestablish the line with Manus. Hopefully Carl Weinberg is still with us as we discuss and try and get some analysis then on the trajectory of the US economy, indeed, the global economy as well. We've got lots of questions about where to go with the UK. It sounds like, and looks like Carl, you're still with us, which is fantastic. The question then, it seemed that Manus was framing there was the opportunity, maybe, given the sell-off that we've seen in the bond and equity markets. What would you need to see to give you the confidence, to give that advice to investors that maybe this is the-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1722,2022-10-11 05:41:23
13497," Pity, maybe, given the sell-off that we've seen in the bond and equity markets, what would you need to see to give you the confidence to give that advice to investors that maybe this is the time to dip your toe? Well, it's a little bit easier for the U.S. than it is for the UK right now to think about what the terminal rate might be. We're thinking that at the end of the day, one of the good things that's going to come out of this whole episode is that we're going to get positive real interest rates. That means that if we get to say neutral interest rates, that would normally be somewhere above inflation expectations and as we're nominal rates are going to be. At the long end, we usually look to 100 to 200 basis points above inflation as being normal. I think that we still have a ways to go on rates to get to those kinds of levels. I think that what we should look for at a terminal rate from the Fed is not only a rate high enough to contain inflation now, but a rate high enough to establish price stability in the longer term. That's a positive real rate and that is long term inflation expectations say 2,2.5% plus a low small spread. Man, let's bring you in at this point. We've reestablished the line with Manus. A little temporary freeze there, Tom. I'm a bit obsessed about American mortgages, apart from the fact that I'm obsessed about my own British mortgage. Our rich treasury rate is over 4%. 30 year mortgages, no, there's a serious point. 30 year mortgages in the United States of America are above 7%. Reversing a 15 year rally in 15 months, that's Martin Milone on a chat with me this morning. That is brutal. That's yet to be put in that real market. Not to US recession in the making, isn't it? Well, it's bad news for the housing market at the margin in the US compared to the UK and many other countries. Most of our mortgages are fixed rate. So for people who already have homes, all right, there's not an impact from that. For people who want to buy homes though, that makes an impact and that affects the home construction industry and that of course leads to slower activity, lower prices for construction materials, less employment and construction and so forth. So there is a strong impact on the housing market, but homeowners, consumers are as affected here as they are over there. This by the way is extremely different from the situation in 2007 when a lot of speculative home buying was financed by variable rate mortgages so that when interest rates started to go up, well, that put the cabochial people's ability to pay and cause the financial prices. They're nowhere near that kind of situation right now. So there'll be a marginal impact on new construction and new transactions and marginal transactions, but not on the stock of existing homeowners as long as they can stay put. Okay, Carl, I think Manus has dropped off again. Maybe to check on us on that UK mortgage. We'll try and reestablish Manus. We'll get him back. Carl, before we let you go, this is a line that really stood out from your latest research report focused on the UK and Europe. The UK, we now know of no way to chart the course of Britain's economy. That is quite a statement from someone like yourself who spent so much time, so many years monitoring the economies of the UK and indeed the global economy. How do you characterize drawing on your experience and your history? How do you characterize this moment for the UK economy? Well, we have a political crisis that is linked to an economic crisis. Well, we have an economic crisis, this linked to a political crisis. They're both spinning around in kind of a spiral. And there's no way to tell how the economy is going to end up until we know how the politics are going to end up. Will the trust government be able to finance this package? How will they finance it? Will they withdraw it? Will they be compelled to withdraw it? Will the Prime Minister be compelled to resign? It doesn't seem likely right now, but it's possible. And then between the Bank of England and the government, there's the big question as to whether or not this government will step in and step on the independence of the Bank of England, which is right on a platform to do has backed away from. But if the Bank of England insists on hiking ways to slow the economy when the government is insisting on stepping on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1723,2022-10-11 05:45:46
13498," ran on a platform to do has backed away from, but if the Bank of England insists on hiking ways to slow the economy when the government is insisting on stimulating the economy with more deficit spending, then that might be a reason for the government to step in and to take the extraordinary step of stepping on the Bank of England's independence, which would send sterling into a tailspin. So there are so many loose ends to the story right now. We really have to wait, I think, for the politics to clarify themselves first. So the budget on October 31st, that will be a big thing. And of course, we have the Bank of England two days later, and we're going to get two forecasts for the UK economy in the same week, two independent forecasts, and I'll bet you they're going to be very different between what the government projects with its budget and what the Bank of England projects with its assessment. And then we'll see how we can reconcile those differences. So everything is up in the air right now. It's possible to make a progress. Yeah, that mounted that mounted mounting of uncertainty facing facing the UK. Maybe as you say, maybe we shouldn't get some clarity come the end of the month with those fiscal plans and the OBR forecast. Karl Weinberg, always excellent, of course, chief economist at high frequency economics. Thank you very much indeed. Just getting you up to speed now for our viewers on a redhead that crossed the terminal a few minutes ago, TSMC shares plunging to post the biggest decline on record currently down at 7.8 percent. Of course, the central semiconductor maker based in Taiwan, this again, as investors continue to digest the restrictions put in place by the White House on Friday around AI chips, supercomputing chips, but also those who manufacture the equipment to produce those chips and their sale into the Chinese market. Very significant step up in those restrictions and TSMC taking a massive hit on the back of that news investors continue to digest. Manus. Yeah, and the stocks index has already been under huge pressure from last Friday in terms of a lot of those manufacturers keeping eye on the likes of ASMR. A lot of big chip makers in the European session when we come back online in the cash market a little bit later. And if you just check out what's going on with the DAX and some of the other European futures, that'll give you a little bit of an indication quite a quite a drop on the DAX time, a half of 1 percent at this stage. Coming up, we're going to stick with the German theme. The German Chancellor Olaf Schultz will reverse a long-held position and support the issuance of joint European debt to ease the energy crisis. The significance of the move next on Blimberg. I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. One of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1724,2022-10-11 05:50:01
13499," Power with David Weston, News and Melosys, inside, from and above, politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. The pockets of every country are different. The fiscal space for every country is different, but many countries have undertaken similar measures. We have been trying to do as ministers of finance and, of course, also in the informal meeting and Prague, the prime ministers to see what we can do together, where the means can be found and how we can take a longer-term view, because this crisis will be with us for quite some time. The Dutch Finance Minister, they are speaking with a very own Maria today, I'll ask you about the fiscal responses to the energy crisis. This week we have had a Bloomberg scoop that Germany is changing tack to support joint debt issuance with conditions. So let's get to our European correspondent Maria today. Maria, this is a quite a huge pivotal moment for Germany, because they were going to do 200 billion support to their own nation, but now they're talking joint debt, but loans, not grants. This is the critical point. And it is a critical point, man. And we should really stress, this would not be a rerun, a repeat of the recovery fund that was approved in 2020, where, by the way, all of Schultz was the German Finance Minister at the time. The point here is that, yes, it would be joint debt in the extent the European institutions tap the market, they get the cash, and then pay it out, ask credit so loans that you have to pay back to member states. But the key here for some of the countries that may be inclined to take this is that if you go to the market as a domestic borrower, you may not be able to lock in the rate that a triple A institution like the EU would be. So this is all about getting that funding rate and locking that in in a way that is beneficial for your country. Some believe it's better to do it as 27 than individual nations. What I would stress, however, is that, of course, this is Germany changing that tone, but this has to be approved. We assume unanimously. And of course, for the time being, we heard it from the Dutch Finance Minister there. She herself was not that convinced. Maria, why now? What has prompted this shift from the Germans? Well, it's a U-turn by the Germans that, in some ways, Tom was initiated by the Germans themselves. If you remember two weeks ago, they came out with this mega package, 200 billion Euro package, to help the German economy. And that set of alarms in the Euro area, there was criticism, and I was there at the Euro group last week. The Germany was sending the wrong message that this was each month or each month, excuse me, to themselves and that had to be remediated. So maybe that's perhaps it's prompted the shift in tone. The other thing, of course, is that it is becoming clear to, well, European leaders that they need to coordinate and there needs to be a joint response to deal with the energy crisis. And remember, we have that deadline coming up on October 20th and 21st, European leaders expect to see a plan from the Commission to bring down energy. The question to me is whether this joint debt would feature as part of the energy response package? Okay. You're a correspondent, Maria Tadeo, in Brussels on that important shift from the Germans and looking ahead to the further response from the EU in that meeting. Coming up, the UK bond itself deepens as lawmakers return to Parliament later for the first time since Quarterm's mini budget reached havoc. We'll get the details.

13500," China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to MED-0. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a longstanding pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. It's Bloomberg Daybreak Europe by Managed Cranny in Istanbul with Tom McKenzie at London HQ. Tom? As we've been discussing, UK GILTS of course sold off aggressively again yesterday, led by inflation linked notes. This of course after the Bank of England's moves to increase emergency backstop measures failed to reassure the market. Some strategists say they doubt the bank's plan to restart active GILTS sales on October 31st. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg economics as Dan Hansen and Bloomberg News is Leigh Ann Garen's. Let's start with you on the politics of this and what is happening with the Chancellor and the Prime Minister and their attempts to reassure the markets, reassure the Parliamentary Party, the Conservatives as well. Yes and detom, so Parliament reopens today's, we've just heard they back in business and that's after two weeks holiday really for those annual party conferences. I know you attended some of them and at 2.30 today, the Chancellor Quasiquarteng is expected to answer treasury questions in the comments. Now this is the first time he would have faced MPs since that mini budget. Tom, since we saw the pound plummet and also all that market turmoil happening, so this is going to be a moment for Quasiquarteng to lay out his agenda really and yesterday we saw that you turned by him, didn't we and the government? They're going to bring forward that fiscal statement and Quasiquarteng was insisting that would happen at the end of November but now we know it's going to happen at the end of October before that B.O.E. rates decision. So this is kind of good news because I guess the guys from the Bank of England will now know really what they're going to deal with and Bloomberg's very own Kitty Donaldson says that Liz Truss and Quasiquarteng are going to be on a charm offensive. They're going to be having extensive meeting with the back benches that we've seen being super rebellious and also another thing they're going to be meeting with the 1922 committee so so much going on and also Quasiquarteng's off to Washington later to meet with the IMF at that and you're going to be. It's all about confidence Leigh Ann, isn't it? That's really what the market wants to get from them. Let's see whether they can deliver that in Washington, Leigh Ann Garen's in London on the latest political issues. Tom, you flagged at the Red Hot headline TSMC on the tank this morning, dying over 8%. So I just wonder how pervasive that's going to be across the rest of our markets because you saw a tech ticket tumble. Yes, you 240 billion globally wiped out so far this year. Wow, wow 240 billion because there's the double concern. There's a restrictions from the US on sales to China but there's also that build up of inventories of course, Manus, that you know about across the semiconductor space. Yes. So those dual pressures being digested by investors and look at that slump for TSMC. Down more than 8% the read across to Europe will be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1726,2022-10-11 05:58:50
13501," No about across the semiconductor space. So those dual pressures being digested by investors and look at that slump for CSMC down more than 8% that really across to Europe will be significant. Our next Bloomberg market's Europe, this is Bloomberg. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record highs since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Eating food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequences. On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. George Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market, Europe by Manor Edwards Live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away here on your top headlines. Inflation angst, global bond slumpers fears build over the impact of rising interest rates, Jamie Zayman and Nobel Prize winner Ben Bananke joined the course of caution. Guilt on edge, Parliament resumes today for the first time since Quasicuarteng's mini budget rates havoc on markets. Jobs data hits imminently. Plus, Joe Biden pledges more military support for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin threatens more attacks. Welcome to the program. Everybody will get back to the geopolitics later on in the program. Let's get to the economics right now. And particularly here in the UK, where we have jobs data breaking. And drawn to the unemployment rate, the ILO unemployment rate for three months, three and a half percent, which is a little bit lower than had been anticipated and lower than the prior months. But it's getting 3.6 percent to come in at 3.5. Not a huge difference, perhaps, but it's certainly moving in the direction that continues to suggest tightness in the labour market, which has been such an issue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1727,2022-10-11 06:03:34
13502," We're within the prior months. So we're expecting 3.6%. It's coming at 3.5. Not a huge difference, perhaps, but it's certainly moving in the direction that continues to suggest tightness in the labour market, which has been such an issue, of course, when it comes to inflation, not just in the UK, elsewhere as well, in particular in the United States, but tightness in labour markets, broadly for many Western economies, being an area of concern because of what it can do to inflation. We also have the average weekly earnings coming in above estimate as well, just a fraction, about 6%, average weekly earnings. That is much higher than the historic norm for that kind of number. The survey numbers are the estimate, it was 5.9%, and the prior month 5.5. So we're certainly keeping those numbers in focus. Now, we've also got some lies through from the Bank of England coming through right now. The Bank of England saying it will widen the scope of its daily guilt purchase operations. It says the enhancements will be in effect from October the 11th until October the 14th. So that is from today until Friday. The Bank of England says it is widening the scope of its daily guilt buying operations. This perhaps comes in the wake of the moves they put in place yesterday, which arguably didn't manage to calm markets because there's a lot of nervousness as we head towards Friday and the ending of the current support programme, the buying of guilt at the long end, that the Bank of England put in place when we saw turmoil in guilt markets triggered by pension issues. So what there was nervousness about that in the markets and then the Bank of England made a statement yesterday, perhaps that failed to cool the markets to soothe the markets sufficiently as we saw yields jumping much more than we'd seen in other jurisdictions yesterday across the UK curve in particular at the long end. So that is of interest. My colleague Valerie also pointing out that there is a 30 year guilt auction today. So all of that kept very much in our minds as we look at what's happening with the UK story. We will return to that narrative shortly. Now, we're just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading in Europe. So let's have a look at the future's picture and a quick reminder of where we've been here, European stocks were weak yesterday, US stocks were weaker yesterday. We're talking about a fraction of a percent or over a percent in some cases for some markets. But that was the backdrop to this future's picture. So expectation of a little bit weaker in Europe and also expectation of similar moves lower in US markets as well because US features are down by half a percent on e-minis. Now that features down by 4.1%. And if we roll on and show you what's going on in the GMM, you can see the global picture here. And it really is one of risk off. There's a really interesting phenomenon around tech stocks being sold off. TSMC in particular, we're focused at that down by more than 8% at one point today. We're very risk off. We're seeing money going into the dollar. We see bonds being sold off. So are yields on the rise. And commodity is also weaker. So this is a continuation of some of the themes that we've talked about recently around risk aversion around concern around higher interest rates and what central bankers are going to try to do to bring down inflation. How far will they go, essentially? And that really is the top conversation this morning. Global bonds are selling off on fears that US inflation numbers will bolster the fed to continue hiking. And as the feds fight continues, the heads of the IMF and the World Bank are warning of a rising risk of a global recession. The risk in the real danger of a world recession next year. The advanced economies are slowing in Europe, the debt levels for the developing countries are getting more and more burdensome. The rise in interest rates puts added weight on it. And inflation is still a major problem for everyone, but especially for the poor. The risk of recession has gone up. The total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2026, $4 trillion. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. Joining us now is Coots and Co CIO, Alan Higgins, who I'm pleased to say joins me on set here in London. Alan, really nice to see you. So of course, we've got a very gloomy setter for forecasts in front of us from the IMF, from the World Bank, at least there. That word sounding very gloomy and we heard from Ben Bananke, Jamie Dimon, plenty of voices adding to the gloom. But you make the point, and I think we should discuss this, that markets are kind of ahead of that story. We have known for a long time about the risks. And how do you balance where we are on markets, where we've got to in the markets, sort of a period of worry versus what we're now hearing from the likes of the IMF and the World Bank? Yeah, morning, Annie. And I'd love you to be here. Yeah, it's true.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1728,2022-10-11 06:07:49
13503," What do you balance where we are on markets? Where we've got to in the market sort of a period of worry versus what we're now hearing from the likes of the IMF and the World Bank? Yeah, morning, Annie. And I'd love you to be here. Yeah, it's tricky, isn't it? So, yeah, recession is not new, is it? We know about that, and everyone is expecting that. How deep it is we don't know. So the issue is, as for us, as a... If you like, capital allocation is preparing for the pivot. And I know that sounds, you know, out of favour right now. But the fact is, if we look back in recent history or even, you know, going back when I was a bond manager when, for example, 1994, when the Fed raised rates from three to six, what happened in 1995? Big rally, up 37 percent, and in the first six months, up 20 percent. And that's the nature of markets. So, look, we're defensive right now. You're full-equity-weighting, but defensive and defensive sectors. But, you know, it's quite tough to time this pivot. And as soon as the market gets a sense of the Fed's towards the end, and I think it needs to get the end of you pull up financial conditions on the terminal, it's, you know, taking out the COVID experience. We're at pretty extreme levels, and there's a lot of distress. OK. Not least in the UK and the LDI. OK, and we'll get to talk about the UK in a little while, but sticking with the US and a more global conversation. I mean, this is US financial conditions we're showing here. To your point, yes, if you take out the COVID issues, then we are reaching levels that you would maybe say, well, certainly, you can see there that financial conditions have tightened. But how they tightened sufficiently. How do we measure whether they have tightened sufficiently, Alan? I mean, inflation, is it really showing signs of coming down and our labour markets on the turn? Is that a necessary condition of doing enough? That's a fair point, probably not enough of the Fed, but certainly enough to cause problems in the system, as we know. And the credit markets are virtually closed. Look, there's lots of evidence that inflation's falling, whether you look at even wages, average hourly earnings, have ticked down a little bit. We know about commodity prices, of course. Use car prices. The sticky one, of course, is in terms of CPI, is the implied rent. That's going to be sticky. Look, we will know on Thursday, won't we, whether we're kind of in the right direction. But there's a lot of evidence for lower inflation. And five-year tips, what is it, training about 2.5% implied inflation? Even the market, the bond market, can see lower inflation. It's quite remarkable if you think we're up at 8, yet the next five years forecast 2.5%. Yes. Because that's complacent, but that's the bond market. The bond market has a record of being more right than wrong. Right, and thinking about what we're seeing in the bond market, is there a lot of people looking out for any signs of financial fragility, I suppose? And some people point to the bond markets where we're seeing declining liquidity in some cases. Is this is an issue for you? Or are you looking elsewhere to see what, quote unquote, what breaks? No, I think you're right. Declan in liquidity, it goes back to that financial conditions. I mean, if you're a market maker, and a major investment bank, yeah, of course, you're going to be cautious about taking on risk and widening bid-off spreads. I get that. And we talked about the credit markets, the investment banks look like they're going to have to have a big lump of Twitter loans that are going to have to sell. No doubt, a loss, that's, you know, imagining going to an investment bank, saying how about another LBO with some loans, no chance. So, yeah, it's really, really tough times. The Fed's done its work. All that's needed now. You mentioned the employment report. That's lagging, I think. All that's needed is real sign, the headline numbers. So CPI, but also personal consumption, which the Fed cares about comes down. And we don't need to see, do we need to see much of it down, taking that to get excited? Alan, I'm just thinking the Fed is going to be under pressure this week with the great and the good of finance gathering in Washington. There'll be plenty of voices, certainly global voices saying, come on, surely you've done enough now. To Lail Brainars Point yesterday, we're still working through a lot of the hikes that have gone already. Do you think the Fed stands its ground? Or not? I mean, how much do we need to see the evidence in a drop in the inflation rate to see the Fed pivot, do we think? Probably, it probably is a couple of percent. And yeah, for now, they'll hold their ground, I think you're right. But remember at the start of the year, the famous dot plot, the Fed voters themselves were forecasting for the end of the year, rates to be zero to a quarter. They changed pretty quickly. And so they can change the other way pretty quickly as well, because it is a dual mandate as we know with the Fed. It's the employment and inflation. So look.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1729,2022-10-11 06:12:23
13504," They can change the other way pretty quickly as well, because it is a dual mandate as we know with the Fed. It's the employment and inflation. So, look, we, you know, being not overweight equities and being relatively defensive, we're a bit nervous about the pivot because give you another example of the pivot. You remember December 18, when the Fed stopped at two and three quarters, five months later, the S&P 500 was up 25%. If you miss out on these mini surges, it could be pretty difficult in our game of asset allocation. And maybe it's that fear of missing out that FOMO that provoked people to get quite so excited in June. That wasn't it, but we're still watching for it. Okay, Alan, thank you so much. Stay with us. Kutes and Co. CIO, Alan Higgins, stays with us on the programme. Let's get a Bloomberg First Read news update. Top stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. Morning, Anna. Bloomberg has learned that Germany is open to the joint issuance of the European Union debt to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. Chancellor Olaf Schultz signaled the change in position on the sidelines of a summit in Prague last week, as long as the funds are dispersed as loans not grants. The move follows criticism that Germany's 200 billion euro energy aid could trigger imbalances in the block. President Vladimir Putin has threatened more strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure after Russian missiles hit cities across the country. US President Joe Biden condemned what he called the utter brutality of the attacks, the most intense since the first days of the invasion. French drivers face more fuel shortages after unions vow to continue strikes as the country's biggest refineries. President Emmanuel Macron's government is being urged to mediate after the dispute left almost a third of petrol stations with supply shortfalls. Japan has reopened its border today to vaccinate travellers from 68 countries, ending almost three years of pandemic restrictions. With a week yen and a relatively low inflation, hopes a high for a rebound in visitor numbers as airlines ramp up international flights. Bloomberg News 20 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg quick take power by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Alice, thank you very much. Anna, I just want to go back to one of the stories we broke at the top of the hour, an update from the Bank of England a day after yesterday's update from the Bank of England. But this one saying they will widen the scope of their daily guilt purchase operations. I mean, I have a bit more detail coming through on what that means. They're going to include the purchase of index linked guilt now, this morning's the BOE, in a statement. They say that this this additional operation and this is from today until Friday will act as a further backstop to restore orderly market conditions. And you can see that what happened to the index linked guilt market yesterday didn't look very orderly at least versus that recent history. We saw the 10-year inflation linked yield surge by the most on record. It moved 67 basis points higher to 1.27%. That was more than double the size of the move in conventional bonds and the biggest move since the initial issuance of this product in 1992. We will return to think about UK assets shortly. We will do that with our guest Alan Higgins. Now coming up, joint borrowing, Germany will back common issuance of EU debt to cushion the blow of the energy crisis with conditions we are live for the latest in Brussels a little bit later. Plus President Biden condemns Russia's missile strikes on Ukraine as Putin threatens more attacks. We discussed the ramping up of protections with Fabrice Portier, CEO of the International Political Consultancy, Erasmus and Global. Up next we'll get back to that bank of England's intervention. We'll get back to the UK asset focus with Alan Higgins of Coots and Co. If you have any of your questions, please do send them to us. IB Plus TV Go is the way to get in touch with the TV team.

13505," It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life Emily isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. You know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets at Europe, but we still have 45 minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading. A future's point a little lower this morning. Let's focus back in on the UK, though. UK guilt sold off again yesterday led by inflation linked notes this after the Bank of England's moves yesterday to increase the emergency backstop measures failed to reassure the market with the central bank stepping up. It's intervention then this morning to include those index linked guilt. Let's talk to Alan Higgins, Co. CIO who is still with us. So it's a fast moving story isn't it the UK and the Bank of England's interventions in guilt markets very fast moving. What do you make of this latest intervention? Is this needed Alan intervening in the 10 year, sorry, in the inflation linked guilt market? Yeah, absolutely needed it. And I worry they haven't done enough quite frankly. I mean, what we saw yesterday was an extraordinary move in guilt and ridiculous move in index linked guilt. And yeah, you've got a real spiral here. It's ironic that that leverage derivatives we worried about banks after 0809 and no one thought it would come in the sleepy corner of pension funds but LDI but there's real leverage there and it's a real problem. And I don't think that I worry that this is not enough and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. Right. And you worry about this because you have experience of working in the pension industry Alan, so what about what they've done so far looks inadequate? I would say so, yeah, there's a spiral. So LDI done in small size, nothing wrong with that or there will be margin called but LDI done in bigger size on pension schemes or grouped together on pension schemes simply means the only liquid assets you really have are guilt so they have your spiral. But of course what we're seeing also is distress selling of other assets, the stories out there about selling CLO, classic cash plus investments, very attractive investments in the long run despite what happened in 0809, they sailed through it and I, but guess what pension funds are now selling those at distressed levels and I, you know, the likes of distress investors are picking them up. That's pretty sad news for pension funds. Right. But the bank of England yesterday's there announcement there was that they were going to, they were going to be open for pensions and those in that sector to post certain, a wider range of cash roll with the bank. They mentioned corporate bonds. Right. They mentioned corporate bonds but, you know, this is a big crisis that we have here at the long end of the UK market. It's very geeky and esoteric but it's, but it can be a real problem because underlying is pension, our pension funds. So I just, you know, we've got a 30 year auction today that doesn't help of, of guilt. I just worry they haven't done enough and by the way to be fair, it's not just the UK, there is a big LDI market in the Eurozone, there likes a Dutch pension funds, etc. And that hasn't blown up in the same way. No, we haven't had the same move but I've been pro...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1731,2022-10-11 06:20:30
13506," There is a big LDI market in the Eurozone. There likes a Dutch pension funds, etc. And that hasn't blown up in the same day. No, we haven't had the same move. But I mean, probably, haven't seen a dry run of what's happened in the UK. I could imagine the Eurozone pension funds will be reassessing just how leveraged they are. This has to be about the speed of these moves, though. Right. Gilt yields, doesn't it, Alan? Because there is a sort of sunlit upland, perhaps, of where higher-gilt yields actually are good for pension funds to some degree. But you're just about the speed with which you get there. And the sort of damage that is caused on route. It's leverage. Yes. In theory, your mind pension, if we have DB schemes, I don't think any more. If you have a DB scheme, those payments are like bonds. And therefore, rising bond yields means the liabilities decrease. That's the theory. But if you do that in a leverage way or too much leverage, then you work for Merrill and Tchaikovsky, and that's actually going to say, sorry, this swap or repo has moved against you, please send the money. As soon as possible. And that's a problem. And is it up to the Bank of England coming now with two days in a row interventions here? Is it up to the Bank of England fix this in the ways that they're trying to do, provide this targeted support at a time of rising interest rates more broadly? Or is it further buty turns from the government that are going to fix this? Or is that horse bolted? So that's a good point. It's a bit of both. So the new government are learning very quickly going back to the old days. Wasn't it James Carville who worked for Clinton and said, I want to come back as a bond market, because it intimidates everyone. That's what's happening right now in the UK for quasi and the new administration. So there's that aspect, yet, a bit of credibility there. But we've got a very specific, unwind problem here at the longer end of the UK with the Bank of England. And he said, I can't understand why they bought so few guilt the last few days. Right. And now they're going to have to buy more. Is that true that they won't buy at any price? Because they're concerned about looking like they're helping the government too much. Come on. It's not helping the government. The UK debt is very long dated. That's the one good part about it. It's ensuring the health of our pension fund system. And even best case, we're getting pension funds selling assets at relatively distressed levels. And bad asset allocation if you like. So look, it's got to go beyond Friday, surely. OK. Interesting place to leave it. Alan, thank you so much. Really good to speak to you. Alan Higgins, Kutzenko, CIO with his thoughts on the UK. And what to the Bank of England needs to do still here? Coming up, the chips are down. US restrictions on China's access to semiconductor technology has wiped $240 billion off the global chipsexcer. We discuss that route next. This is Linkback. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, which is a tricycle empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back, and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual, I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft. So I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft. And do by machine what should be done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1732,2022-10-11 06:25:05
13507," I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. This is really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being revert. Welcome back to Greenberg Markets. Europe, we still have just under 14 minutes until the start of cash trading for this Tuesday morning. Our futures point a little bit lower. Now, we're whopping $240 billion has been wiped off the market value of the global semiconductor sector. Chip-related stocks in Asia have plunged after the U.S. government restricted China's access to semiconductor technology. Joining us now is Benberg's Ishika Mukaji in Singapore. Is she nice to speak to you? So walk us through this really dismal day then for Chip stocks in Asia. Hey Anna, yeah, it's been a really terrible day for Chip stocks across Japan, South Korea and Taiwan as the markets resume trading. They joined their China peers in the global route that we're seeing in Chip stocks and that's mostly on U.S. export curbs on China's access to semiconductor technology. The worry here is that even companies that are non-US that have plants in China could get affected by these curbs. It would require additional hurdles or more government sign-offs. And you saw TSMC which is the world's most valuable semiconductor company fall more than 8% today and draw a lot of money. So it's been quite a terrible day. This comes as these chip stocks not just contend with U.S. restrictions but also a hawkish Fed and falling consumer demand. Third quarter shipments for laptops and desktop computers were down 15% globally according to IDC data. So this is not a good time for chip companies. Yes, I want to ask you about that but yes to reflect on what you said there about other nations being caught up in this. You've mentioned the Taiwanese story there and TSMC not a target of this but still being caught up in it. Similarly, Korean operators and the Korean won't even reportedly under pressure as a result of this story. So back to the timing of this then is it very bad timing with chip stocks already then grappling with the host of things you've already pointed to. The hawkish Fed slowing demand things getting worse for a sector already under pressure. Yes, you could see TSMC is impact on the Taiwan Stock Index today which had its worst days in March 2020 and was leading losses in the region. In terms of the problems that are facing chip companies right now and advanced micro devices for example, missed its projections and for sales in the third quarter, Samsung also that came out with its preliminary quarterly results, disappointed investors. Some memory makers are cutting back output as much as 30%. So there are a lot of issues that are surrounding chip stocks right now and it doesn't seem like it's going to get any better in the second half of this year. Ishika, thank you so much. Ishika Mukaji joining us there in Singapore. Coming up on the program, Russia strikes on Ukraine on widely condemned as President Putin threatens to launch more missiles. We've seen things develop over the last couple of days with that explosion blamed on Ukraine by the Russians but not accepted by Ukraine. Although they have seen to be pleased by it that explosion on the bridge between Crimea and Russia then followed by attacks on various parts of Ukraine. The Russians say that they were going after infrastructure but the evidence on the ground points to much wider damage and further loss of life. We'll get the latest on how these attacks leave the broader conflict and where we head next. This is Moonberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1733,2022-10-11 06:29:03
13508," Can never forget that! Want to join some wonderful people, shall I tell? Yes you are. No need. How yet and... I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the non-successful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. I mean, you've really got to focus on your talent. In the past, it's always been given money. You know, show them that they have an upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to work. I think post-pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family, I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to a tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with our head, heart and hands. Not just head and hands, the heart has to be engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that their citizens and the community, their members and family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee. Be an employee and be a person to the community and the family. The stakes are higher. I'm the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside, from and about politics, power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative, like just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of cypheration fears, moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe. We still have half an hour until the start of cash equities trading here in Europe. Here are your top stories. Inflation angst, global bond slumpers, fears build over the impact of rising interest rates, Jamie Diamond and Nobel Prize winner Ben Bananke joined the chorus of caution. Gil Tron edge, parliament resumes today for the first time since Quante Quattains mini budget wreaked havoc on markets. The Bank of England steps up its bond market interventions once again this morning. Plus Joe Biden pledges more military support for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin threatens more attacks. Welcome back to the program everybody. While European equity markets, the future picture looks a little downbeat. The US future picture also looks a little bit downbeat. We have expectations of further weakness at the start of the European and the US trading session. This on the back of some losses of yesterday, the ongoing concerns around inflation and of course, and just how much tighter policy will get as we try to deal with that inflation is very much the talking point today. And we will get to a conversation about that right now as the world's top central bankers congregate at the IMF meeting in Washington DC this week. We're hearing increasing calls for coordinated interventions to weaken the US dollar. Our market senator Valerie tight elis here to talk us through her view on how much of this Valerie could bring to you. How much of this is greenback strength and how much of this is actually weakness elsewhere for understandable policy driven reasons. What's what's your analysis? Yes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1734,2022-10-11 06:33:33
13509," How much of this is greenback strength and how much of this is actually weakness elsewhere for understandable policy driven reasons what's what's your analysis? Yes, so we hear a time and time again calls for another plaza accord to To spur some weakness into this really strong dollar which as people like to say is a wrecking ball for the global economy But I want to point out a different dynamic that we really can't lose sight of as we as we focus on these effects dynamics and it's the terms of trade now These indexes are it's a basket of their imports minus their exports so as these As these lines have gone more negative recently that means it exports have gotten Cheaper and imports have gotten more expensive now now we know the main thing driving these is Energy imports these three lines. I've got the UK Japan and Eurozone those are all three energy dependent economies as we call them So we had a terms of trade shock They're their their exports are becoming cheaper their imports are getting very very expensive now This drives a currency dynamic in the background their effects will weaken because of that and the thing that's surprising about this is countries Like Germany like South Korea for example used to run these really plush I Aren't we had data out just overnight Japan posting its worst terms of trade ever and South Korea just last week the same thing second to worst terms of trade It's ever seen now these dynamics are Won't be reversed just because the Fed pivots or just because we sign a new plaza accord to turn the dollar around This will only shift when the energy crisis abates and the energy crisis is being driven by geopolitical factors We have opette cutting capacity we have Russia Russia squeezing gas supplies the rest of rest of Europe and and these are dynamics which which aren't going to change very quickly You know it was only a few months ago We were hearing that it's not just going to be this winter. That's a problem But it's going to be maybe the next 10 well this will continually drive currency weakness versus the US dollar Mm-hmm and in effect well will push you'll tire in these economies So just blaming the Fed and just looking at the dollar I think it's really only grappling one side of the story and it's honestly It's the energy crisis which can is going to have way more of a lasting effect to which we should be worried about right? Okay, I guess some of those governments if they were here to put that point of view across Valerie might say They're trying to tackle those energy crises, but yeah, absolutely not necessarily a case of this just being all about dollar appreciation But their currency is under pressure for understood reasons thanks so much Valerie tights L with her thoughts on the markets this morning And what has really been driving these currency moves?

13510," We're now joined by Rasmussen Global CEO, Fabrice Potier. Fabrice, very nice to have you with us. So to help us understand and assess the latest escalation in the conflict, we saw the attack on the bridge over the weekend, we saw the resulting attack on Ukraine by the Russians. How would you assess this escalation? Well, I think we are looking at two wars here. One is the one where the Ukrainians have a clear advantage, which is a conventional war on the battlefield. And it's about putting pressure on the Russian supplies, the Russian forces, actually taking them, blocking them to escape, like it is the case on the western side of the Nipol river around Kyrgyzstan. And there, I think clearly the Ukrainians are doing very well. Largest thanks to also the kind of weapons that have been supplied over the last few months. And then you have another kind of war, a darker one, and a more political one, and psychological, which is waged by Putin because he's losing the other one. And it's about basically using war tactics and terror tactics to create fear on civilian population in Ukraine. But importantly, and this is why the G7 reaction is very important, to create fear also in the western public opinion. And I think this is really his way of trying to pressure us and to bring us to submission both the Ukrainians and the West. And how do you think the West should respond to that, then, Feb. Because you talk about maybe some of the more psychological elements, but we are arguably also seeing attacks on western infrastructure, whether that's pipelines or whether that's some have talked about the German train system and whether that was sabotaged by unknown forces over the weekend and asking questions as to whether Russia might have been involved. So how should the West respond to that kind of attack from Russia? The first word you've described is exactly what I'm talking about, which is mostly a kind of fear tactic to kind of really make us doubt about the result. And therefore, to answer your question, the best answer is to double down on our resolve exactly what President Biden has done yesterday by announcing that the United States will be delivering the kind of air defense and missile defense systems. And that's what the United States has been asking for months, which will allow them to actually do really important defensive things, which is to protect their civilian population and protect critical infrastructure. Okay, and so that helps with protecting the infrastructure from the attacks it's coming under right now. Of course, President Putin has talked about using all means available to attack Russia if he feels that Russia is under attack if he feels it is threatened. And the use of tactical nuclear weapons has been discussed here, Feb. How concerned are you about that kind of development? What kind of likelihood do you attach to that? Well, first I think we should always be concerned when the world leader is is talking about nuclear weapons and using nuclear black belt to get his way where he's failing in conventional means. So this is something that should be treated very seriously. So, I don't think we should fall into the trap of talking about tactical versus non tactical nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapon is nuclear weapon. And the use of that weapon will fundamentally change the nature of the conflict in Ukraine and around Ukraine. And so this is my mind. So is my last point is that I think that we're putting also knows and has been told clearly by the West, including and especially the United States that the moment he dares breaking the nuclear taboo and use it. He will basically change fundamental nature of the conflict and bring it to a level where the consequences will be terrible, including obviously for him and Russia. So I think this is this game of red match shape is game of political escalation to again push push us in the corner out of fear and somehow negotiate with him. And to that we have to continue what we've been doing with the Ukrainians for the past few months. The US has kept its response. It's response to use of nuclear weapons kind of vague febriacy. Is that the right course of action at this point? I mean, I think you have to give you have to clearly answer the kind of answer you give does not have to be telegraphing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1736,2022-10-11 06:42:09
13511," action at this point. Yeah, I mean, I think you have to give, you have to clearly answer the kind of answer you give. There's not have to be telegraphing everything you will be willing to do. Should there be a nuclear use? So I think that was a kind of right answer, which is you are not giving all the options you are considering, but you are clearly saying that there will be options and there will be response. So I think the US line, which has been, for example, mentioned two weeks ago by the Jackson, Ivan, is any bottom one? Okay. So that's the US response or the US warning as to what would happen if nuclear weapons were employed. What about the role of China here, February, since perhaps other powers as well in Asia, in trying to persuade Russia to a particular course of action? I don't think China is in the posture of trying to persuade Russia, putting something, I think China is probably trying to minimize what it sees as a really disastrous situation and Vladimir Putin as Putin self into, maintains some level of political solidarity with Moscow, but clearly so far China has not crossed the line of supporting and aiding Vladimir Putin's war, including by providing advanced weapons system. So I think the Chinese have told the line from the start of the conflict, which is an important thing. And nuclear, obviously they are watching that with probably a lot of weariness, even that it puts a value, ugly precedent, which could obviously have repercussions in the Pacific. Fabrice, thank you so much. Thanks for joining us. Fabrice Puttier, the CEO of Rasmussen Global, joining us there to take stock of where we've got to in the war in Ukraine. Coming up on the programme, the German Chancellor Olaf Schultz will reverse a long-held position and support the issuance of joint European Union debt to ease the energy crisis. We'll explain the significance of that move and some of the nuance next. This is Lengberg. Tomorrow, Lengberg has the biggest names in business.

The coverage begins tomorrow, only on Lengberg, your global business authority. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about travelling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic.

13512," Great question. Great question. And the best question I get all night. Remember top experts, great questions. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty moving forward deliberately in a data dependent manner, we'll enable us to learn how economic activity, employment and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessment of the path of the policy rate. Federal Reserve is committed to returning inflation to its 2% average goal. To do so, I expect we will need to raise rates further and then to hold that stance for a while. Of course, the exact path forward for policy will depend on the evolution of the economy and risks to the outlook. I was Federal Reserve, Vice Chair, Leo Brainard and Chicago Fed President Charles Evans. Speaking about the rate outlook and what the central bank is planning to do, of course, let's get a blue-booth-first-wed news update. Top stories we're covering this morning. Here's Alice. Hi, Anna. The heads of the IMF and World Bank are warning of a rising risk of a global recession. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva says higher interest rates are adding to debt pressures on developing nations. She says about a third of the world's economy will enter recession this year or next. The risk of recession has gone up. The total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2026. Four trillion dollars. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. French drivers face more fuel shortages after Union's vow to continue strikes at the country's biggest refineries. The current Emanuel Macron's government is being urged to mediate after the dispute left almost a third of petrol stations with supply shortfalls. Reports have emerged of Iranian oil workers joining protests which have continued over the death of a 22-year-old woman last month in the custody of the so-called morality police. Unverified social media videos purportedly show dozens of labourers and uniformed workers marching. Blue will use 20,000 a day on air and on Bloomberg quick take power by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thanks very much, Anna Sankins here in London. Now, German Chancellor Olaf Schultz will reverse a steadfast German position and support the issuance of EU debt to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. A Bloomberg scoop shows that the pivot, however, comes with strings attached. For more, let's get to our European correspondent Maria today who is in Brussels. Germany then looks to be more open than it was to the idea of joint debt, but take us into some of the nuance, some of the detail. Yes, Anna. And it comes with the strings attached because we should make it very clear. This is not a repeat of the recovery fund that was put in place in 2020. Remember, that was a big instrument, a joint debt to deal with the pandemic. It was paid out and cashed out as grants and loans. And of course, it's a European institution that would issue this debt. Now, in this case, you're looking at credit. This would be loans. This is a European institution that tap the market, they get the cash, and then they pay it out to member states. But they have to pay it back. The real key thing, and this is really the point of this measure that is being explored is that for a lot of countries, it has become clear now that this winter crisis will need more resources. But if you do it as the EU27, the interest rates will be more advantageous than going in the market, where of course rates are going up and doing it domestically, very country like Italy. This is good news for you, but I should say we should make it clear it's not a rerun of the recovery fund. And also, this is a change of heart from the Germans, but Anna, you know very well for anything to get done in the European Union. You need the 27 to agree. And yesterday, when I spoke with the Dutch finance minister, she told me that for the time being, they didn't see a need to come up with new instruments. So there's always a difference between what you say in public and what you negotiate behind the scenes, but that's a stage where we act. And I know it's different, as you spell out from the recovery fund, but I also remember you were asking the Dutch prime minister to see if he was going to support the recovery fund. So they will also hold out on that until agreement was finally reached. Why now then, Maria? Because we've seen Germany take unilateral action and we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1738,2022-10-11 06:50:56
13513," To see if he was going to support the recovery fund. So they will also hold out on that until agreement was finally reached. Why now then, Maria? Because we've seen Germany take unilateral action and we saw that that was unpopular with some in Europe. Is that what has triggered this? Well, Anna, that's a very good point because we talk about this U-turn by Germany, but in many ways it's precipitated by Germans' own actions. If you remember, two weeks ago, they came out with this massive 200 billion euro package back and last week at the Eurogroup, you could really feel the tension behind the scenes. Some members of the Euro area were concerned that this was sending the wrong message that this was every country left to their own devices. They were also concerned about perhaps the lack of internal communication among EU members. So this precipitated to some extent a change of heart from Germany, but again, we should stress that this is still at a very early stage. This will have to be approved presumably by the EU 27 countries as a whole and to me, the big question is, what's the deadline for this? And will it be included in the energy package that, as you know, European leaders are set to debate on October 21 and October 20. So that is next week. A lot of things could change from now until a week's time. Okay, Maria, thanks very much for the update. Our European correspondent Maria Tadeo in Brussels coming up on the programme. We will look at your stocks to watch, including SC Micro. As European and US chipmakers are in focus for a second day following a route, the wiped out more than $240 billion from the sector's global market value. This has been very focused on Asia for, in terms of the overnight news flow, of course. Let's see how this was going to play out for Europe. This is going back. China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy-secure. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. China has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. On the David Rubensstein show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders to the future. We will be back with more interesting news. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe. We still have for seven or so minutes until the start of cash equity trading. The future is a little negative. Let's get to the individual stocks in focus for us today. Tom McKenzie joins us and we talked a lot about the damage done to Asian chip producers as a result of a rule change by the US, which I think is supposed to be targeted at China, but seems to be having broader global fallout. Second day whether the stock stocks are in focus, this was more than 100 page document that the US pushed through on Friday. Maybe it's a question of investors continuing to digest the implications. As you say, much broader than just those direct",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1739,2022-10-11 06:55:36
13514," more than 100 page document that the US pushed through on Friday. So maybe it's a question of investors continuing to digest the implications. As you say, much broader than just those direct sales to China, but also about the equipment makers. And of course, the biggest contractor there in terms of same predictors globally is TSMC and they took a hit at one point in the stock was down more than 8% of the biggest drop for a number of decades. Again, on the back of these concerns, we're focusing on the European chip makers, of course, S-D-Micro. You can also bring in ASML, the maker of these ultra-virate lithography machines. We looked at that, yes, that the infinite likely to be under pressure as well. As again, investors digest what is happening in terms of these restrictions from the US at a time as well of a build up of inventories of chips. So really a double blow there and we saw a market round of about $240 billion US dollars taken off this sector in terms of market cap already, Anna. And further pressure expected across these stocks this morning. OK, so another day where we keep that sector firmly in focus, what about Juvidan, the sort of sense and flavours manufacturer? Yeah, based on Switzerland, a miss when it comes to the third quarter, they posted sales that came in a little below the estimates. And the expectation from the analysis, you're going to get a bit of hit to the stock on the back of this, particularly disappointing with the sales in terms of its well-being unit, its health and well-being unit, it tastes and well-being unit, I should say, over in North America. That's been zeroed in on by some analysts as a point of concern. We could consume a demand taking a hit then for Juvidan and this stock may be under pressure again at the open. And on to the pharmaceutical sector, AstraZeneca. We were all looking forward, at least many of us, were to moving away from vaccines and to new towards nasal sprays when it comes to COVID-19, but they failed in their trials. They had some early success in China, they had a bit of success in India, but not with their latest trials, overseen by Oxford University. So they're going to have to go back to the drawing board on this, the UK-based drug company, of course, that came out and had some success with its COVID vaccine. In terms of the nasal spray, though, they say there's a lot more research that needs to be done. OK, I'm sure we'll find other things to look forward to, Tom. Although with the winter approach, you're here. Something more colorful. Tom McKenzie, thank you very much. Our European markets open, anchor, coming up is the European market open, of course, before we get there. Let's take a moment to have a look at where we are on the future's picture. It looks quite negative and US futures look negative as well. US futures down six cents of 1% on E-minis and NASDAQ futures right now. This is the picture through Asia and the Asian equity markets are down. Overall, by one point, well, just shy of two percent, in fact, if you look at the MSCI Asia Pacific. And again, it's that focus on tech stocks. We saw TSMC in particular under pressure down as much as eight percent at one point. And broadly speaking, we have seen quite a risk off session through Asia. And that looks as if it's something we will inherit here in Europe. The dollar is up by two cents of one percent on the dollar index this morning. And we see weakness in other currencies, as you see there, on the Australian dollar and the Chinese currency. The open is coming up next. This is Bloomberg. It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but you know, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry costs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1740,2022-10-11 06:59:36
13515," broadening their scope of intervention to start adding guilt that it index linked as well. And in terms of the language from the BIO, warning about what they describe as fire sale conditions, warning about the impacts on the financial markets, then file sale conditions are what they want to avoid and they're broadening that scope. We'll check in on guilt in just the next few seconds. The futures are pointing lower. You had four straight losses, state side futures in the US also pointing to further red across the equity space. The Spanish Ibex currently down 55 points, a loss of 7.5% of the cash on in France, a down 7.8% of the percent now as well. Here in the UK, the FTSE 100 off by 5.10, the jobs data again, at the same time as the BIOE is intervening in the guilt's market, it also has to position around a tighter labor market 3.5% in terms of unemployment. That is the lowest level on unemployment for about 50 years increasing the expectations, particularly amongst our team at Bloomberg Economics of a more aggressive BIOE on November the 3rd. Let's switch it over and see how things are playing out then across the assets. Future state side, as I said, pointing further losses down now at 1%. And by the way, the sell-off isn't just in guilt, is also in treasuries across the curve yields up. The pound at 1.10, that's a loss, a drop of 4.10s of a percent. Again, as the chancellor is going to face additional scrutiny over his mini budget, he's brought forward his plans to reduce or release those fiscal plans towards the end of October. The 10-year-over in the US 396, that's a move higher by eight, almost nine basis points, and Brent, $95 a barrel down, 9.10s of percent on growth concerns. We're switching it over quickly to look on guilt's, of course, they just opened it in the last few seconds. The fresh headlines, of course, being what is happening with that BIOE intervention. You can see yields are off just a little bit down, four basis points on the five-year, 458, the 10-year, 4.44, so currently down, three basis points on the year. So a little bit of movement there as the BIOE steps in with that additional support, we'll continue to watch this space, of course, because of the pressure from the guilt markets and how it translates, particularly, into the housing markets. Francie? Tom, if we take a little deeper into some of these sectors, actually none of them are in the green. So we have a couple of very specific companies that are still managing to hold up, but overall, the 19 groups are down. I'm looking at basic resources, engine insurance on the way down, the most between 1.7 and 1.3%, and then also for chip makers that are having an impact on technology here, because we're seeing a route that also continued in Asia time. Now, as the Fed's fight against inflation continues, the heads of the IMF and the World Bank are warning of a rising risk of a global recession. There's the risk in the real danger of a world recession next year. The advanced economies are slowing in Europe, the debt levels for the developing countries are getting more and more burdensome. The rise in interest rates puts added weight on it, and inflation is still a major problem for everyone, but especially for the poor. The risk of recession has gone up. The total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2020, $4 trillion. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. Okay, joining us now for more is Kristina Kino and Amalyo Koko. Head of European equity strategy at Barclays. Christine, let's start with you then on the recession risks. The concerns have been heard, they're voiced by the World Bank and the IMF. At a time when Goldman Sachs are saying we should not be pricing a Fed pivot. They remain short equities, at least in the short term. Yeah, Tom, I mean, I think this is the part now of this policy cycle where we're seeing opinions diverge over where the Fed and central banks in general can go next, because after a few rate increases over the summer, we are starting to see some of those filtered through to the economy and what we're seeing is really not great. Again, risks of recession very much at the forefront of investor's mind. That's starting to get borne out in the economic data as well. And so you would expect at this juncture to see that division between the camps that think no, the Fed has to keep going and really tackle this inflation issue versus some of the more cautious camps that say, actually, we are now starting to see signs of the economy buckling under in some ways, quite an unprecedented...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1741,2022-10-11 07:06:58
13516," The more cautious camps that say actually we are now starting to see signs of the economy buckling under in some ways quite an unprecedented a cycle of policy tightening across the globe. It's very interesting again, Tom, that you pointed out the camps that are in each group. One of them is of course Goldman saying that it's too early for a Fed pivot. And then on the other hand, we have Lail a brain art from the Fed itself. We do know that she is quite unknown dove, but she is acknowledging the impact now of the Fed's tightening cycle in the world economy and how that's going to feed back through to the US in a negative way. Hey, Manuel, how much more brutal will the markets be? And I know you've you know, changed your positioning into value defensive stocks. Is that still the strategy? It is. And I think what we've been seeing so far is a very orderly de-risking. There was no panic in the market. The panic was very much in rates in effects, but now spreading to the equity market. And we are seeing in the last couple of weeks more sign of de-risking, a setting by real money investors who have been waiting to see evidence of fundamental deterioration. So I think the complexity of this market is that there is no put from central banks. You know, we've been used to invest in the world where central banks were always coming to the rescue for the last 10, 15 years. And now this arise finish is gone. And we need to learn to invest without this put from central banks. So something has to give. Is our central banks come to the rescue? Also, why does the market has to get more than about a fairly disorderly set off from here? Okay, there may not be a put, but there's a backstop, at least the B.O.E. that's how they're describing it. Again, describing what they see as significant repricing of UK debt. The dysfunction in this market and the prospect of self reinforcing fire sale is what they want to avoid. Christine, a remarkable language for the Bank of England. Absolutely, Tom. And that in and of itself is actually quite worrying the fact that they are referring to what they're seeing in markets as a fire sale. I mean, that's partly probably why we're not necessarily seeing the intended, intended effect of the B.O.E. measures in the markets. But I do continue to sell off. And I think this most recent action was prompted by yesterday's sell off in index linked guilt specifically. This particular sector, of course, is still quite a large proportion of holdings by a lot of pension funds. And I think that the fact that we are seeing that selling off as well, clearly worrying the B.O.E. hence they decided to step in with more measures. It's going to be interesting to see, Tom, how far the B.O.E. is willing to go in terms of its support for bond markets. And whether this does factor into their longer term policy trajectory, particularly when it comes to the process of quantitative tightening or rolling those previous bond purchases off their balance sheet. Emmanuel, overall, so we'll talk about the Bank of England in just a couple of minutes. But overall, do you think there's a willingness for central banks to do more or does this just have to unwind itself? Well, I mean, there is no easy option for central banks. I mean, they keep telling us every single day, inflation is the main concerns they have. And they have no other solution and slowings the economy in order to get inflation under control. But obviously, the balance of risk now is shifting towards financial stability. And as we know, central banks have dual mandates to preserve financial stability and price stability. So what the Bank of England has done is telling us that there is a bit more nervousness from central bankers on financial stability. But at the end of the day, we got the data this morning, still a very, very tight labor market, still very high in inflation. So there is no free lunch. I mean, in obvious, there is no much central banks can do to support the markets. They can provide a backstop, as you said, but they cannot really stimulate the economy. So the market is entering an era of slower economic growth with all this ability from central banks to help on the growth zone. Yeah, and the million dollar question is actually here in the UK. The backstop doesn't seem to work. So what happens next? So, Bloomberg, Christina Kino, Emmanuel Co. stays with us. We'll talk a lot more about the UK time. Yeah, coming up, the British Chancellor is set to face Parliament against that backdrop then of the market volatility we're just discussing. And of course, intervention in the UK bond markets will have the details that is next. This is blue blood.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1742,2022-10-11 07:11:04

Welcome to the market to extrapolate what the beer is doing to the US. The Fed is telling us to do now how aggressive do they need to be with interest rates, but also how long do they need to keep the backstop. By the end of the week, the Fed will stop buying bonds. This is a market that is not funded. You would expect some weapons in the bond market. I don't think the beer can be on payments. What does that mean for attractiveness? You can do to meet market expectations. They need to balance risk on financial stability. And in the last 10 days, we already had some of the major announced earlier being removed. The government is starting to be more aware of the risk of financial stability. What's your take on Europe right now? We're hearing noises from Germany saying they're ready to help out for some of the joint issuance and things like that. Is that really a temporary measure or is Europe on a new path forward? Europe is always making big step when we have crisis. This kind of old project of fiscal integration started two years ago with COVID and the EU will be a big part of the recovery fund. Any sense of more integration to tackle this energy crisis would be probably welcome. But I think what the market wants to see is something that goes beyond the emergency package, something that goes beyond the kind of fire fighting. You want to see something which aims to grow the economy over time and to invest in a way that some of the issues that we are suffering from at the moment. Energy security defense will be resolved in a productive way. So what we want is investment in Europe to deal with stack-fascionary shock.

13518," with the defense will be resolved in a productive way. So what we want is investment in Europe to deal with this kind of stuck-fascionary shock. So fiscal spending is good if it is credible to extent. And if it is coming with productive gain of us, along run. On earnings, we're shifting into that this week, particularly, it was the end of the week with the banks out of the US. The consensus is for high single-digit EPS growth into 2023, margin expansion. Does that hold? I don't think it does. And as things, the Q3 numbers will mark an acceleration in the don't-grade cycle. So far, we've seen a bit of disconnect between what has been a fairly tricky weaker macro environment and still a very confident corporate sector. Harnings have been holding up fairly well this year. So my markets, the equity market, has been completed with unvalued rates. We've seen a massive valuation adjustment in the battle of rising rates. Now the focus is shifting on what this titling policy means for the real economy and for earnings. And we've seen a number of high-profile warnings in the last couple of weeks. So we know what to expect for Q3. As things the outlook will be, fatty cautious, I would be surprised if you get a lot of companies telling us everything is great. So I think we're going to see a bit of repressing of expectation into next year. And there is no way you're going to have pretty much double-digit EPS growth, margin expansion, in a recessionary environment. So what's the sector that you'd be selling off right now? Well, we are very cautious on some of the cyclicals, which are still on high multiples, like industrials. You know, we're underweight industrials. We see the inventory cycle is turning, basically. And that's going to hurt margin, pricing, and volumes. We are underweight on the weak balance sheet sectors, like real estate. What we like is a mix of value and defensive, as you said, Francine. So we like energy. We still believe we have an energy shock to deal with. Energy sector utilities we like. We like healthcare or something, which is defensive and dollar-erner. You have some of the cheap opportunities, now emerging in cyclicals, like autos or bank, you look very, very cheap. But again, we don't think this is going to prevail when you have so much risk on certain toned earnings from. So it sounds like you're looking at autos and banks, potentially. You're potentially lining up an entry point, but you need to say a catalyst. We are starting to see some opportunities. So maybe working on the short big things, that sense. At the time of threats, you want to start looking at opportunities and how you make money over the long run. I'm just saying that there is no catalyst so far to arbitrage those cheap evaluations. And to some extent, we have not yet seen the balance sheet or the earnings risk being reprized. So we are working on some of the shopping list, but we are not in a rush to step in. I was going to say it's like catching a falling knife. Indeed. So how do you catch it? Well, firstly, we are not trying to jump in. We are not catching it yet. I think we are thinking about how to catch it. But again, I think patients matter in those markets. And again, we had very, we had a flash crash two years ago. We don't think this one is going to be. And we don't see a V-shaped recovery. We don't see a tendency to step in. Because again, for the time being, central banks need to slow the economy. Once they want to help us again, once they want to turn stimulated, then you want to kind of step in and buy the market. Because at this stage, the fundamentals don't really matter. You just buy the put from central banks. We are not quite there yet. Emmanuel, thank you so much for joining us. Emmanuel Koder, head of European equity strategy at Berkeley. It's now coming up.

This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday.

13519," This video is to watch how to get industries grown long, and so let's try to achieve cash all of a sudden. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was fully before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs I think want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this David has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing. And it's completely emerged because of the pandemic.

Welcome back to open 23 minutes into your European trading day. You're seeing losses of 7.10% across the benchmark futures in the US. Also pointing to build on the losses four straight days now of losses in the US. It looks like you get a fifth straight day as well as markets readjust again to the concerns around higher rates. And what the inflation dynamics mean as we lead up to that Thursday print out of the US. The movement again in the GILTS market, though, is the B.O.E. intervenes and expands its intervention, friends. And you now have yields coming off quite significantly across the curve in the UK. So a 10 basis point move lower at the front end, for example, 428 on your two year. I mean, one of the smartest people that I speak to on GILTS is Van Rame. And he's saying, look at the very least to try and stabilize. They have to persist with, of course, some of the backstop for another two weeks. We get into the November 3rd, the meeting for the Bank of England. And then what happens in November 3rd? Do they hike by one full basis points? What's even for more engages? Certainly investors will keep a lot of pressure on some of these GILTS. Yeah, that need for stability, as you say. And really fascinated to think about how they're going to weigh up the OBR analysis and forecasts alongside that fiscal plan from quasi-quartan. Again, as you said, who's bringing it forward, currently, again, yields off across the curve down 10 basis points on the two year. They've expanded this intervention to include GILTS that it index linked. But at the same time, in the flip side of this, and we're discussing with the manual call, the Labour market here remains very tight. 3.5% unemployment, which means they are going to have to raise rates, but maybe not as aggressively in my name, of course, from Barclay saying 75 basis points in November 3rd, not 100, which is what the market price is going to be. Except if you have a very tight Labour market that means that inflation is actually going to increase, as people look for some of the jobs. I had to say no one would want the governor's job right now. For the longest time as anyone can recall, also the UK has run a definite, current account, certainly now they're paying the price for it. Now let's get straight to the Bloomberg business flash with our sad Guantialis. Hi, Francine. Bloomberg is landing.

13520," In Berger's land, the UK is pushing ahead with plans to set a cap on the revenues of renewable power producers. Government officials held talks yesterday with energy companies on a mechanism similar to the one proposed in the EU. The move would limit revenues and channel the funds to help struggling consumers. Rivian shares have tumbled after the EV makers said it would recall nearly all the cars it delivered after discovering a minus structural defect. The US company said while the issue was only found in seven vehicles, it's recalling about 13,000. Rivian only recently overcame production problems and part shortages. And London's most expensive home is up for sale again. Bloomberg has learned the chairman of in battle Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has put the night's bridge mansion back on the market.

Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app. In the News and Stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like Cartyler Shifts or Mortgage Lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and dishoeing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps will surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or App tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple Podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

The On the David Rubenstein Show, here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesday's on Bloomberg Television. Welcome back to the Open, everyone. 30 minutes into the European trading den here, are your top stories. Inflation angst fears build over the impact of rising interest rates, Jamie Dimon, a Nobel Prize winner, Ben Bernanke joined the course of caution. The B.O.E. steps up its bond market intervention this morning. Parliament resumes today for the first time since quasi-quarting's mini-budget, wreaked havoc on markets. Plus, Joe Biden pledges more military support for Ukraine as Biden reputans more attacks on Ukraine. Tom, look at the markets. I have to say there's nowhere to hide. Nothing's looking pretty today. Yeah, it's pretty grim once again. The geopolitics were front and center yesterday. The B.O.E. has intervened today and we're checking on the guilt markets shortly. Because there's been a little bit of relief. But how long that lasts, as you say, is the Chancellor's head to Parliament but grilled again on his fiscal plans that he's brought forward to the end of October alongside the OBR as well. It's interesting to hear, though, from Fed officials, the senior Fed official, LL Brainard, overnight in the U.S. of course, to face chair of the Fed Reserve. We have to monitor global risks as well and talking about the lag in terms of the rates that have been pushed through and the timeframe for when that starts to impact the economy. So possibly hinting at a slightly more cautious approach even as others suggest, like Goldman Sachs, that it's no time yet to price in a pivot from the Fed. The European Stocks 600 currently down 5.10s of A percent. So continuing the selling pressure here, the FTSE 100 off by 5.10s of A percent as well. Despite the fact that the labour market came in with a pretty solid number, in fact, the lowest unemployment rate, 3.5% for 50 years. But of course, that does make the job of the B O E that much more difficult and just raises the bet on a more aggressive bank of income, November the 3rd. The banks over in Germany off by 43 points. Switched to oversee how things are playing out across the sector. There was the handful, the last time I looked, that were in the green, including retail, real estate. And, yeah, those are the two really at the top of the list. Retail up 3.10s of A percent. Everything else in the red. Heavy selling across basic resources, chemicals and energy. So that is the sector look. And as well, we'll check in if we don't know now. We'll look at GILTS as well, because you do have some money flowing into GILTS again on the back of that intervention from the B O E. Some pretty interesting language in terms of their statement saying that they are pushing back against what they see as fire, sale dynamics within these bond markets. Let's get to the Bloomberg first word news now. With Alice at Kins Alice. Hi Tom, the heads of the IMF and World Bank are warning of a rising risk of a global recession. IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva says higher interest rates are adding to debt pressures on developing nations. She says about a third of the world economy will enter a session this year or next. The risk of recession has gone up. The total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2026. Four trillion dollars. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. French drivers face more fuel shortages after unions vow to continue strikes at the country's biggest refineries.

This is as long.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1747,2022-10-11 07:36:39
13522," Thank you. Now, Germany is coming around to backing the idea of joint EU debt issuance to help cushion the blow of the energy crisis. This is as long as the money is dispersed as loans. That's important, not grants, according to Bloomberg News, and that was a scoop. While details haven't been ironed out yet, the topic will likely come up in the discussions as EU leaders meet in Brussels next week. For more, we go to Maria today in Brussels. Maria, what exactly happened then? What do we know at this point in terms of the debate, how it unfolded in the shift? This important shift from the Germans. Well, Tom, this is a very active debate, and it has been for a week. Ever since the Eurogroup met last week on the Monday, Tuesday was obvious that something was cooking, that something is going on. Now, we should make it very clear this plan that is being considered, explored, debated. However, you want to call it, it's not a repeat of the 2020 recovery fund. That was huge. Remember, it was 750 billion euros. It was paid in grants and loans. In this case, we're not looking at grants. This would be loans. The difference here, and essentially, this is the bottom line of the issue that's being debated, is that members of the EU have come around with the reality that this winter crisis, they will need additional resources. The question is, what funding rate do you get at? If you're an individual country, you go to the market, you may not be as well pleased as you could be. If you do it as EU27, backed by EU institutions with a triple A rating. So, that is where the debate is at. And again, I should stress, this is very similar to a Brunner-Mail told us last week. It's very similar to an op-ed that was put out by Paulo Gentilani, Tierra Bratona, a number of European officials, put in this already out in the public debate for a day. So, this is a debate that is pending. It's ongoing and as you alluded to, it will probably carry out all the way to next week with European leaders finally gathered here in Brussels. So, Maria, change of heart in Germany, of course, important, not definitive. Will there be enough consensus overall? Yeah, and you make a very good point, Francine, because the German government itself has not really well-commented on this. We're signal that that's the way officially that they're heading into. But of course, as you know, politicians, they can say one thing in public and then be debate in something behind the scenes. What I would stress, however, even if you get Germany on board, this is the EU. And as you know, very well, Francine, you need unanimity for this. You need the 27 to agree to this. And yesterday, when I spoke to the Dutch Finance Minister, she was very clear to me that they, for themselves, do not really see the need for more tools. So, you say there's already enough money to do on the rounds, and it should be better employed instead of creating new instruments. Maria, thanks so much. Are European correspondents? Maria, today they're in Brussels. So, let's check a look. Well, let's check a look. Do you like that? Let's take a look at GILTS. I feel like I'm all over the place. A little bit like GILTS, because we have the third intervention from the Bank of England today. And yet, there's a lot of concern of how the Bank of England has misfired. Again, the UK has run a deficit in its current account for a long time. And so, if you look at the fiscal books, they have to balance it, or we won't rely on the kindness of strangers as much. So, there's a couple of things in terms of liquidity that we think regulators are probably looking at. But also, what does it take at this point for the Bank of England to be able to stabilize the GILTS? And I know I keep banging on about this, but I think the language from the Bank of England is pretty fascinating. They say, and I'm quoting, the dysfunction in this market and the prospect of self-reinforcing fire-sale dynamics pose a material risk to UK financial stability. That quoting directly from the B.O.E. statement, hence the intervention today, broadening that ban in terms of what they're adding, in terms of GILTS. And talking of GILTS, there has been some money moving into the GILTS on the back of this intervention. Yealed are lower by nine basis points on the two-year at 429, the 10-year, 441. That's a move lower by six basis points on the back of this intervention. We'll keep across these GILTS markets for you. Coming up, Russia strikes on Ukraine our widely condemned. As President Putin threatens to launch more missiles, we've got more context in that story next. The next steps, possibly, for the Russian President.

13523," Jingle Bell! China's appetite for energy is enormous. The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply, 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure, it has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. Welcome back to the Open 40 Minutes into European Training Day losses of 610th of a percent across the benchmark. The heaviest selling over in Italy, currently down by 1% here in the UK, the FTSE 100 off by 610th of a percent futures in the US, also lower by 610th of a percent after four days of losses on US equities. Eurodollar at 97 cents and the pound at 110. That is the shape of their play at 41 minutes into the training day frenzy. Our next guest, Tom, wants to create a world more sustainable world by using green hydrogen to heat our homes and fuel our cars. It is a pretty bold approach that uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. We will form a key part of the debate at COP27 next month in Egypt. We are delighted to be joined by Vittel Cohen, co-founder of an after-win of the prestigious earth shop prize. As always, thank you so much for coming on Bloomberg. There are still a lot of questions about hydrogen, how you make it, and no hydrogen is actually created equal. But what is change in terms of demand for electrolyzers given fossil fuel prices have sorted so much? Absolutely. Thank you so much for having us. I can say that the demand has only been booming because green hydrogen is an alternative to fossil fuels and we need a clean gas. Every kilowatt hour of gas consumption that we produce instead are using green hydrogen for reducing our energy prices. We can see as an electrolyzer producer the demand is growing. Absolutely. What about the competition from China, for example, where electrolyzer companies are coming up thick and fast and we know the ability for China to scale and we saw that play out across the solar space, for example. How do you compete with those players? Absolutely, it is a race. We believe that we have the sound strategy and the right technology to compete in this race and we believe that the AM electrolyzer is a standardized modular system that can be scaled up fast in terms of production. So we are not afraid. We are ready for this. What is your biggest concern when you compete with China? So if you look at the solar panel and there could be parallels, right? A lot of the solar panels are made in China.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1749,2022-10-11 07:44:29
13524," We're not afraid. We're ready for this. What's your biggest concern, though, when you compete with China? So if you look at the solar panel, there could be parallels, right? A lot of the solar panels are made in China. They're cheaper. I think 90% of them are made over there. How do you, in Europe, capitalize on your first mover advantage? No, definitely a great question. And I think this is a team effort, right? So this is not just an after against the world. I think this is really, as a European coalition to really move forward in this. And I think there are some learnings in terms of what have been learned from the solar industry. And here, for example, at an after what we do is that we make everything in our electrolyzer from Asia's Z. And so we understand the full process and know that nothing will hold us back and we can keep moving fast in terms of our production and our scale up. And talking about production, you have a factory in Germany. Have you started production at that factory? And if not, when will that happen? So we just received the keys to the R&D building actually last Friday. So now we're moving in. And we will start the production early of 2023. So construction is on time finishing the construction of the production hall, as we speak. How do you take on the huge industrial players? I mean, you have to be more nimble, or there are tricks to the trade. Yeah, the industrial ones are, they're a completely different market, right? They really need to, let's say, be attracted to a lower cost of green hydrogen. So everything that we do is cater towards scaling fast and reducing the costs. So I think actually the trick with them is to start conversations early, right? Because they will not transition so quickly. And so we need to start our local conversations now. And we're happy to already be in some projects, for example, where our electrolyzers are used for green ammonia. And they're scaling up in a very modular way, because they see that they can quickly plug in our systems and increase their green ammonia production with a modular electrolyzer. You talked about the costs. I'm interested to know, what is the lowest cost you can produce hydrogen at? From the factory in Germany, for example. Right. But the cost of green hydrogen depends on the cost of electricity, right? So there's not one single price point. And it really depends also on what the application is, whether it's industrial application or whether it is a commercial one. But we believe that with our megawatt scale electrolyzer, we will be cost competitive with gray hydrogen cost. By the way, we're all getting ready for COP27. I know there's a lot of concerns that actually either companies are scaling back where investors have less appetite for this as the world's problems that we talk about day and day out. It just seemed to be mounting more and more. Are you frustrated by the slow progression of green things in Europe? You know, I think COP is the only international platform that we have to have such conversations. So it's going to move at its pace. But yes, of course, I think that we need to do everything we can to move quickly and not defer action, especially not in terms of scaling up and deploying green hydrogen and green electricity in Europe. How do you look at the US as a market? They're pushed through the inflation reduction act. Of course, a big component is subsidies and spending on green technology. Arguably, there's going to be increased competition then from American electrolyzer companies. There's also in the market you might look to play in how do you think about that as a proposition? Absolutely. Things are asking. So the US is super attractive right now, right? Because they've got this tax production cut of $3 per kilogram. So we're actually already active in the US in terms of creating this green ammonia, for example, but also in terms of providing green energy for disaster relief solutions. So we are already active in this market and believe that it'll be a booming market, especially because they're going big, right? We were just at a fair actually a couple of weeks ago and there just we want to make green hydrogen. We'll figure out what it's for because we know that the demand for green hydrogen is there. And so we are going all in and we believe in it. Empowering ahead, no pun intended. Yes, my dear. Thank you so much for joining us. As always, Viteco and their co-founder of an appter. OK, we talked about the US and the inflation reduction act now to what is happening in terms of geopolitics. President Biden condemning what he calls the quote, utter brutality of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine. And that's as Vladimir Putin wants of more attacks. Several cities, including Kiev, the capital were hit by a barrage. Yesterday killing at least 11 people and wounding over 60. The strikes came after Putin blamed Ukraine for an attack on the bridge linking Crimea to Russia. Let's get to Bloomberg's executive editor then for international government, Ross Materson, who's been following all of this. Ross, would you categorize this? Are the experts, the analysts, categorizing this as a turning point in this conflict? Well, it's really more a telling point than a turning point, potentially, because it...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1750,2022-10-11 07:49:12
13525," All of this, Ros, would you categorise this, are the experts, the analysts categorising this as a turning point in this conflict? Well, it's really more a telling point than a turning point, potentially, because it does fit the pattern of what we've been seeing for some weeks now, which is that Vladimir Putin's forces are very much struggling on the ground. And as they get bogged down, and in fact, as they lose some of the territory that they had claimed and taken in the early months of the war, and certainly his initial goals of taking the whole of Ukraine quickly, obviously failed, that he's becoming more and more desiring to use infrastructure as a weapon going into winter in Europe. And we see that also more broadly with Europe, of course, with the energy crisis that is looming in many parts of Europe. But with Ukraine, particularly yesterday, went with the infrastructure that was hit by missiles across multiple cities, not only civilians, of course, hurt in that or killed, but also electricity taken out. So what he's doing is trying to cause problems through Ukrainians going into winter, perhaps, to wear them down as this war goes on, and very much nears the eight-month mark, and to say, well, I'm going to persist no matter what, even if my trips are getting nowhere on the ground. But what options does Vladimir Putin have left for us? Well, that is the question. What is the off-ramp if anything for Vladimir Putin? Or what can he do from here? I mean, obviously, there's a lot of discussion and really speculation about what might be, for one of the better words, the nuclear option, is that still something that he might consider if he continues to fail on the ground. Does he desire to do some kind of tactical nuclear attack on Ukraine? Does he test and you can rush in territories somewhere to send a message? Does he try and go that far? Or does he constrain himself at the moment to further missile attacks in and around key cities? We can see that Zaporetsia was hit again today. He's been striking that for several weeks, and that is where the nuclear power plant, of course, is located. And, Ros, we heard pretty strong conformation, as we'd expect from the Europeans, from the US as well, beyond the rhetoric, the combination, is there a sign that they're going to be stepping up? What has already been, of course, significant material support for Ukraine on the back of what we saw yesterday? Well, certainly we're saying that they're continuing financial support. At the moment, the Ukrainian government just needs money to keep functioning, to keep going with the war, but also the military support. There's been a lot of success sending in artillery ammunition and so on. But what the US and NATO allies of Bulkdart is sending NATO-standard weapons in, and that's really sort of fighter jets, modern tanks and so on, and really the air cover that Blonemis Lensky said that he needs to repel the Russian forces. And the concern there is that if you provide really high level artillery support that you'll be engaging Russia effectively directly by NATO, and you can see that they're going to continue to say that they won't do that. So even though we'll see further calls today in that group of seven conversation from Ukraine for those weapons, it's unlikely to come. OK, Bloomberg's executive editor for International Government, Rosematterson, walking us through the implications and the fallout from this barrage of attacks by Russia on Ukrainian cities. Thank you very much indeed. Coming up, a whopping $240 billion. $240 billion has been wiped off the market value of the global semi-conductor sector. Further pain this morning across that space.

Welcome back to the open. We are 52 minutes into the European trading day. This is a picture of a real European stock. We weigh the risk of inflation. What is happening here in the UK with GILTS is also sending warning signs across the board. I know not a lot of people think there is a crossover with how the B.O.E. is trying to deal with GILTS. What the Fed can do is add fuel to the fire of an ever more difficult market. Let's do more of a deep dive on these markets. How they have moved and adjusted in the first hour, almost the first hour of trading on Tuesday morning. Let's bring in the one and only Yann Patrick Barnett of Bloomberg. Always good to speak to you about what has been happening. You will take the IMF, the World Bank, shock horror, warning of recession. How much gloom is there in these markets at this point? Very good morning. I would say a lot of gloom. If you read through the top stories this morning, there is very little to get some confidence out there to build positive sentiment in equity markets. We have these macro warnings. We have the story from Ukraine where this terrible war signifies that it probably goes rather longer than shorter. There is no change inside. We have the chip route going on. We have the inflation number coming up. That is uncertainty looming. That is very little to build a bullish case for stocks at this moment from my point of view. Another few days for tech and chip stocks. What is the way forward? That is super difficult. Chips are like everywhere in our daily life. The decline in demand shows you that the global economy is cooling down. There is always a concern about going into a recession. It is also a big problem for Europe. We are lagging the growth and technology sector compared to the US. The little bit that we do have is to a large degree directly or indirectly in the chip sector. With that sector not doing well, it is also being a burden for another burden for the European stock market. Yang Patrick, the B.O.E. intervening again. Giltz yields a little bit. What do you make of this intervention? They are warning of fire-sale dynamics in these markets. Basically they have no other choice than to do this. We know about the pension fund problem that there are long-duration assets. They are in a massive trap here. The bank of England has to do something there. Central bank intervention is probably good in the short term. It creates a lot of problems in the long term. We are now in this trap for central banks. There are actions on what they can do to come down markets are very limited, given we have more than the bank.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1752,2022-10-11 07:57:30
13527," And I would say a little bit of a trap for central banks that their actions, what they can do to calm down markets are very limited given we have more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates. But, JP, if you're a central bank right now, how much do you, do you try and intervene to try and support, for example, some of the bonds, or do you just let it go, because it's part of a natural repracing? Well, if I'm a central bank, I would have a massive amount of ends to be sure, because you don't know if your methods will work in the long term. Of course, they can't do nothing, so they have to do something to try to calm markets down. And then the short term intervention in buying either bonds or supporting the currency is probably pretty much the only thing that they can do, but they're also very well aware that they can't do this indefinitely, and that when the market is wanting to go into one direction, they have to put up a lot of firepower to fight this. And this is a very dangerous path that has a high probability, I would say, that you get even more into the corner, and what do you do then? So, if I'm a central bank, I'm very concerned right now. And it is often short lived, isn't it? I don't know if it's the Yang-Pantric Barnett effect, but currently you're seeing yields edging, well, you're down, just by one basis point now on the front end, here in the UK. And in fact, the selling has resumed at the 30-year level just marginally. Yang-Pantric Barnett always fantastic. Thank you very much indeed. That is it for the European market open surveillance. Early edition is up next, futures pointing lower in the US. It's brilliant that. Coming around. Let's put things around. It's impossible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1 trillion of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual. You're always, always learning.

13528," This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopelittle potential rises. This is Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition with Francine Markwell. Good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition and Francine Lackwish. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Inflation angst fears builds over the impact of rising interest rates. Jamie Diamond and Noble Price winner Ben Brunanki join the chorus of caution. The B.O.E. steps up its bond market intervention. This morning parliament resumes today for the first time since Project Bartang's mini-budget wreaked havoc on markets. Plus, Joe Biden pledges more military support for Ukraine as Vladimir Putin threatens more attacks. So, first thing is first let's check on the markets. Stocks found definitely pressured by rising treasury yields and signs that company earnings will not be as good as expected. Do we've seen already a couple of disappointments when it comes to earnings or when it comes to chips and also a gauge of dollar which we'll get to in a second climb to the highest this month. The European shares overall are down. We have S&P futures also a bit of pressure but if you look at the European stocks they're also declining for a fifth straight session as bond yields jumping. Again, the persistently higher inflation is what people are concerned about as well as the impact of hawkish central bank policies and global growth. Then watch out for the yields the 30 year. Look at that 4666. The personal thing that people are worried about is of course the bank of England will have to do a lot more. This is a third time that it intervenes on the markets with now widening the scope of what it could buy but the question of timeline is extremely important as it's unlikely that the markets will like if they start QT later on this week and then the other big questions of course do they need to continue buying bonds into that November 3rd bank of England decision and how aggressive will they be then. So I don't know if we have a European map maybe we do maybe we don't. If we do it's a good time to show it and it's really a sea of red across the board with the FTSE done 7 tens of 8% FTSE made down 1.6%. So as we were saying global bonds selling off on fears that US inflation numbers will bolster the Fed to continue hiking. Now this as the Fed's fight continues the heads of the IMF and World Bank are also warning of a rising risk of a global recession. The risk in the real danger of a world recession next year the advanced economies are slowing in Europe the debt levels for the developing countries are getting more and more burdensome. The rise in interest rates puts added weight on it and inflation is still a major problem for everyone but especially for the poor. The risk of recession has gone up the total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2026 for trillion dollars. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. Well we're joined by George Rikup, Portfolio Manjuret 91 and Christina Quino from our market team so thank you both for joining us. Christine let's start off with you when you look at the anxiousness on the markets is again when will the central banks pivot and it doesn't look like they're ready to pivot yet at all. Absolutely friends. At least when it comes to the Fed in terms of its tightening policy we definitely see a lot of camps arguing out there. Goldman being one of them saying that it really is too early especially given the tightness in the labor market in the US and the fact that inflation is probably still going to be at sticky at these relatively high levels we'll probably get confirmation of that of course this week with the US CPI figures and yeah I think it really has been the priority of the Fed to tackle inflation although I would note that we do have Leo Brainard now starting to kind of sound out the potential impact right of a tighter Fed policy had up close through to the global economy in terms of weaker demand and then how that in turn impacts the US economy she is of course a known dove so not quite the consensus view it doesn't seem like at the Fed but something to keep an eye out for. Yes certainly to keep an eye on your overall how much can the central bank support markets right now and if they can't support them because they don't want to or just",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1754,2022-10-11 08:06:13
13529," But something to keep an eye out for. Yes, certainly to keep an eye on your overall. How much can the Central Bank support markets right now? And if they can't support them because they don't want to or just it has to play out itself, what should traders be doing? So I think we would agree. Our base case is absolutely that the Fed will stay the course. That means of choppy couple of months for markets. It also means our base case is a recessionary scenario. And what that means for us as active fundamental investors is that we have to find those companies that are more resilient, that have pricing power, and that can thrive or at least perform better through that very choppy. That's hard. When you look at earnings, probably everyone will be tested. Where do you find that value? No, that's exactly right. So we are going through all of our company investments, looking at our forecasts. We do see areas where companies are much more resilient. I think this is an unusual scenario where, certainly in Europe, you may have a high energy price recession. And that means that there are parts of the market, companies that are the solution providers for energy efficiency, perhaps other parts of the sustainability universe, companies that are providing increasingly cheaper, alternative power sources to more expensive energy. All of those companies might perform quite differently in that recession. When you look at some of the movements, not only in GILTS, but in bonds overall, I mean, I don't know. It's impossible to find a floor actually. Yeah, it really does seem like that, isn't it, Francine? I mean, the UK, of course, it's own very special case. Again, we have the Bank of England itself saying that it is afraid of the risk of a fire sale, its own birds in the UK bond market. And that's why it's stepping up. It's measures for a second-day in a row. But more broadly speaking, I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right? The yields keep going higher as a lot of these central banks continue to telegraph more rate hikes. You do, of course, have camps now coming out and saying, well, actually bonds are attractive. We've been talking about this PIMCO bill gross among them. But again, it's a question of timing this particular trade, right? I think it probably might make more sense if that trade comes through perhaps in six months when markets are expecting the Fed Fund's rate to hit its peak. At least it's based on current pricing. And then that might be really when that sort of bond bullish trade pays off. But at the moment, it really doesn't seem like it feels like a pay entry really for a lot of these bills. Yeah. And I guess the idea of the question is, why do markets not quite believe that central banks will be as aggressive as they say they will be? But I think it really depends on where you are. I think markets generally, as I said, in the US, if those of us who are reading the Fed commentary, we believe that they will stay the course. I think in Europe and in the UK, it's a lot more difficult. Investors want credibility and visibility. I don't think you have either of those things at the moment here in the UK in terms of fiscal and monetary policy. And it's going to take time to regain that credibility and visibility. Dierger, thanks so much. Dierger, Cooper, the report for the Madras. 91 stays with us and Christine Aquino from our market team. Thank you as well. Coming up the B.O.E. widens, it's bond buying. Lawmakers returned to Parliament later for the first time since quasi-quart tax. Many budget breaches have worked. What's coming up next is the boomer. When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this. It was a tricycle empire. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. You gotta think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1755,2022-10-11 08:10:34
13530," and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. Didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Peat fat, peat cold, kishnests, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still sticky. US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite away from the poll. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday. On Bloomberg. I worry they haven't done enough. Quite frankly, I mean, what we saw yesterday was an extraordinary move in guilt and ridiculous move in index linked guilt. And yeah, you've got a real spiral here. I worry that this is not enough. And I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. Well, Alan Higgins, Chief Investments, are at Cootson, the Bank of England's intervention in the guilt market. Now, the bill we expanded, it's bond buying after UK bond sold off again yesterday led by inflation linked notes. The Chancellor quasi-quartang, meanwhile, is had to present for Vice-Physical Plans on October 31. His second attempt follows a package of unfunded tax giveaways that sent markets into a tailspin last month. Now, joining us now is Dan Hansen, Bloomberg Economics Senior UK Economist, and great to speak to you. And you look at what the Bank of England has been trying to do. So this is the third time that they've intervened or winded the scope of what they can do. How much more will they do to stabilize guilt? Yeah, I'm a morning friend. I think that's a really interesting question because we've got this October 14th deadline Friday this week. And I think the bank's in a real bind because it keeps intervening and it's being very reactionary at the moment. And I think what markets are looking for is a little bit more certainty and a little bit more certainty beyond this October 14th deadline. I think, you know, if you're looking at it, it seems more likely than not. There's going to be at least some sort of commitment from the bank to say, look, we're going to be here if we get another flare-up. And I think that probably at the more extreme end is that they sort of back up and say, look, we're just going to stay in the market for longer. And as you mentioned, they're getting quality-quarting time to set out. It's just a plan between them. We're getting a lot to the 31st now. But, Dan, if you think they need to persist with the backstop, right? For another two weeks, maybe, you know, dovetailing into that November 3rd meeting, which is also the point that Ven Ramit is making on the blog today. Then why do they not do it now? I feel like it's trickle, trickle, trickle, or third time intervening and the markets are just testing that. Yeah, I think that's right. I think there is a really good question there about why they haven't decided to say, look, we're just going to stick this all the way out to the end of October. And I haven't got a good answer for why they aren't doing it, because it's very clear that the market is very jittery. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And I think they're just going to have to do something to bridge this gap. And the fundamentally is a part about bridging the gap. Ultimately, this whole question about credibility and this broader question is on the government and it's on fiscal policy. So the bank has a role in this, but ultimately, it's not going to be the answer. The answer lies with fiscal policy. So, Dan, when you look at how much the bank of England needs to raise rates by, you know, the market's probably pricing in 100 basis points. Does that seem too much or too little? So I think for them to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1756,2022-10-11 08:15:02
13531," Does that seem too much or too little? The big fiscal stimulus is essentially a free swing for them. What they'll be watching as well for this meeting on October 31st and how much he offsets the fiscal easing of the tax cut with spending cuts. What I think further out though is the market is getting ahead of itself. We've got market pricing at around 5.75 or 6% here in the UK for peak rate. I think that's too high. I think the bank is going to be very worried. Probably when it gets to about 4%, which I think is likely for 4.5% seems like a reasonable bet for me. Once you get to that level, the bank is going to be very worried about recessionary dynamics. Also about the impact of high rates on the housing market. We're already seeing the increase in mortgage rates and how less effect in people's income. So I think those two things are going to stop it out a little bit lower than markets are currently expecting. When you look at the fiscal spending and we heard from the IFS very respected institute saying they need to find 60 billion in funding, basically, in austerity. The government needs, so it's now a choice between whether they go ahead with their plans and where they can save. Is that the kind of figure you're also looking at? I know that the situation changes every day and we have some really great analysis at Bloomberg economics. You're right. It does change every day. Every time interest rates change, the target changes the amount of debt interest the government has to pay out. But I think the IFS is about in the right ballpark. About 60 billion pounds looks to put their own downward trajectory. It's the same downward trajectory. About 60 billion pounds looks right to us. I mean, the challenge that we're saying is finding that course we've had austerity over the 2010s in the UK. It strips so much out of departments and budgets that he's going to have to look across departments or budgets. He's going to have to look across benefits, but also potentially across investments spending as well to make the sums add up. And even then, it looks like a stretch. So you can't help but feel that there's going to be a question around tax as well. Yeah. Potentially not the tax cuts that were announced and reversals there in new terms, but potentially tax increases elsewhere because the scale of what needs to be found to make this add up is an all. Dan, thanks so much. Dan Hansen there, senior UK conmist at Bloomberg Economics. Now we're back with Durdray Cooper portfolio manager at 91 Durdray. I know we talked, you know, big picture about the UK guild market, but in general, what do you do with UK assets? Look, I think the I would absolutely agree with Dan that it's a very difficult situation here in the UK. But to your question, that doesn't list it in the UK who really are global businesses. Who potentially benefit actually from a weaker band. And we see some opportunity across our UK equity funds to invest in those companies that really attract evaluations. I don't know whether I know you also look very closely at sustainability and there was maybe, you know, 14 or 18 months ago, there was a belief that the UK, because of its change in stature, could become the kind of green bond capital, certainly in Europe, if not of the world. Is that now taking a back step because of some more date, you know, date that it crises that regulators are looking for? I think that's a really big risk. I think you're absolutely right. The UK was a leader, generally speaking, in building an economy to get to a net zero. The UK was fantastic in terms of an early move into offshore wind. Really is the market leader in terms of offshore wind. We talked earlier about how from a fiscal and monetary perspective, we need more credibility and more visibility. We need exactly the same on energy policy. You can see the government at the moment thinking about renegotiating contracts for renewable energy. There's no visibility for investors in those markets. And that's going to damage the UK's journey to net zero, which is important for climate. But also really important for economic growth. You know, we've seen what the US has done with the inflation reduction act. We've seen how that's going to set the US on a pathway to lower energy costs and to more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1757,2022-10-11 08:19:15
13532," We've seen what the US has done with the Inflation Reduction Act. We've seen how that's going to set the US on a pathway to lower energy costs and to more competitiveness. And we already see companies actually across our investment universe relocating manufacturing that was going to be in Europe back to the US because it's just a better place to be from a cost perspective. I dare to have to explain this so that the government is not focused too much on that zero because they're trying to focus on other things. Maybe a reluctance because we also heard Jacob Riesmog talking about fracking. So is there a reluctance to embrace when the previous government had done? Or is it just that investors are no longer there because they worry about other things? Investors are absolutely there. Investors are looking for places to put money to work that can be resilient through a recession and the government needs to understand us. Okay. Dear, Julie, thanks so much. Dear Kupfer, they're a portfolio manager at 91. Now coming up, German Chancellor, Olive Schultz will reverse a long-held position and support the issuance of joint European Union debt to easy energy prices will explain the significance of that move shortly. This is Bloomberg. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hawkishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. The inflation is still sticky. US economy is still on track.

This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday. Bloomberg. Bloomberg. Bloomberg. Bloomberg. COVID has changed everything. People are changing the way they work and the way they travel. Can you explain what you mean? I think the world is never going back to the way it was before the pandemic. And one of the changes I think, David, has been a change in how we work. Many people had a job at an office. They're not going to be required to come back to the office five days a week. And I think that I don't think CEOs per se are going to determine these policies. I think workers will. Because all of us CEOs want the best talent. And I think flexibility is going to be the second most important benefit after compensation. All of this, David, has culminated in the Airbnb not just being a company about traveling, but now a company about living. So this is whole new category of travel that's not classic two, three nights in a city. It's not long-term housing and it's completely emerged because of the pandemic. When US jobs numbers are released. When coming almost bang on Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. If you're looking for 263,000, you've won an instant expert analysis. Participation coming down to put it all together for us. This is a slight disappointment relative to hope. You can find anything if your hawkers are published in this work. It's going to keep the fit on track for a 75 basis point rule at the next meeting. This labor market is still pretty resilient. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg, your global business authority.

13533," Here to peer conversations, I uncover the untold stories of the world's most successful leaders. Watch Wednesdays on Bloomberg Television. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a data dependent manner, we'll enable us to learn how economic activity, employment and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessment of the path of the policy rate. Federal Reserve is committed to returning inflation to its 2% average goal. To do so, I expect we will need to raise rates further and then to hold that stance for a while. Of course, the exact path forward for policy will depend on the evolution of the economy and risk to the outlook. Well, the Federal Vice Chair, Leo Brainard and Chicago Federal President Charles Evans on the right at Look for Central Banks. Now, we've been talking a lot about guilds. Of course, this is after with the Bank of England announced for the third time. At the very least, a lot of market participants say the Bank of England may need to persist with the backstop for another two weeks. That's according to our Ven Ram. He has some great entry points also on the live blog. Remember, through the B O E meeting, how big a margin does the Bank of England need to raise by to make sure that the market gets the right figure on inflation, the right message on inflation? So we also have some of the undue leverage. So we have a great story looking at some of the things that led us to where we are today on guilds. You can see that 30 year for 639. Now, let's get straight to the Bloomberg. First word to use. Here's the end guarantee. Bloomberg has learned that Germany is open to the joint issuance of European Union debt to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. Chancellor Olaf Schultz signaled that the chains and position on the sidelines of a summit in Prague last week, as long as the funds are paid out as loans not grants. The move follows criticism that Germany's 200 billion euro energy aid could trigger imbalances in the block. Now the heads of the IMF and World Bank of Warning are the rising risk of a global recession. IMF managing director Kristalina Gorgieva says higher interest rates are adding to debt pressures on developing nations. She says about a third of the world's economy will inter recession this year or next. The risk of recession has gone up. The total amount that would be wiped out by the slowdown of the world economy is going to be between now and 2026. Four trillion dollars. This is the size of Germany GDP gone. Now friends drivers face more fuel shortages after unions vow to continue strikes at the country's biggest refineries. President Emmanuel Macron's government has been urged to mediate after the dispute less almost a third of petrol stations with supply shortfalls. And Japan has reopened its border today to vaccinated travelers from 68 countries ending almost three years of pandemic restrictions.

The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply. 35% more than the US annually. Its energy needs have more than tripled since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to fuel astonishing growth, but it's come at a cost. China is the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to net zero. The country's reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well-being of its citizens. China is not energy secure. It has a massive import bill for things like oil and gas. It has a long-standing pollution problem. And it is also prone to outages that severely hamper industry. All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation.

Nor that of NATO or the European Union. We need to stand firm with Ukraine, particularly and even more so in the face of such cruelty and such war violations.

13535," We need to stand firm with Ukraine, particularly and even more so on the face of such cruelty and such war violations. And we need to stand firm with Ukraine. Does it mean sanctions, stay put? Maybe they go in Kraschando? That support financially will also materialize not just on weapons, but the cash they say they need? Well, on all levels, politically, militarily, financially, the humanitarian support, there is one front. It's a European front and, of course, our NATO allies to make sure that the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people get what they need in order to withstand these atrocities. And of course, as we reported today, what they want is their defense systems and Russia also branded as a terrorist state. But going into the impact that this has to in Europe, because we can feel it pretty much every day in the cost of living, food, crisis, inflation, energy bills. When you look at this blackmail in the hands of Russia, how do you respond to this economically how can you alleviate some of the pressures if you can? Well, we do need to alleviate. We do need to also invest, of course, in support our own citizens, particularly because it can't be that the outcome of this war will be that our population is suffering, that they feel they might be a loss of support for this righteous effort to support peace and security and international law, standing by the people of Ukraine, so it can't be. So we need to make money available. We need to have the right support packages as we have been doing. Each country in their own way, but often in a coordinated manner, because our own populations also need to be able to get through winter and the response to blackmail can never be that we give in. And you mentioned the coordination, and that takes me perfectly to my next question. There has been over the past week a lot of debating Europe about national measures are great, but not everyone has the same physical capacity. It's not a secret that Germany created all of tension with this 200 billion euro package, and there has been now calls that perhaps has married new tools or a form of joint response. Will you look at it from the Dutch perspective? How do you look at this? Well, no fairness. We've also recently announced the very generous additional package in support of households and a small to medium term enterprises, and it's a temporary set of interventions, as is desirable by, for instance, the ECB or the IMF. If you support, if you help, do it tangible, do it targeted and make it time bound. And I also acknowledge that, of course, the pockets of every country are different. The physical space for every country is different. But many countries have undertaken similar measures sometimes earlier, and you can't compare them one-on-one. But we've been trying to do as ministers of finance, and of course also in the informal meeting and Prague, the prime ministers, to see what we can do together, where the means can be found, and how we can take a longer-term view, because this crisis will be with us for quite some time. And the market, however, they're looking at potentially something that may not be a recovery fund, but may see, well, a joint action or actions backed by the European Union's AAA reading. Is that something that you would contemplate? Well, from the Netherlands so far, we've said there's a lot of money available in the different funds that we've created for other crises. I mean, in the Reconnae Recovery Fund, we've probably used a recent one that also accelerates the energy transition. There are billions and billions of funds available that have yet to be allocated. Let's look at that first, and let's see what our joint course of action will be. And at the same time, we often, we always call for a national government action where that's feasible. At the same time, we need to look towards debt sustainability, not just of our own country, but of the eurozone as a whole. Let's get straight to your Bloomberg business flash now with Glea and Garence. Hi, Lea. Hi, Francine. We've learned the UK is pushing ahead with plans to set a cap on the revenues of renewable power producers. Government officials held talks yesterday with energy companies on a mechanism similar to the one proposed in the EU. The move would limit revenues and channels of the funds to help struggling consumers. Now, Rivian shares have tumbled after the EV makers said it would recall nearly all the cars it delivered after discovering a minor structural defect. The US company says, well, the issue was only found in seven vehicles. It's recalling about 13,000 Rivian only recently overcame production problems and parts shortages.

Bloomberg has learned the chairman of and battle Chinese real estate giant Evergrande has put the ninth bridge mansion back on the market. The 45 bedroom property overlooking Hyde Park was snapped up for 210 million pounds in April 2020 and that's your Bloomberg business flash in France. I would be dread to think of electricity and gas bills come the winter but I know I'm not who they're marketing to. Leanne coming up. Brushless strikes on Ukraine are widely condemned as President Putin threatens to launch more missiles. We have the full story on next. This is Woodburg. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. We take fat, peak hawkishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to sue progress on inflation? Fed just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. inflation is still sticky. US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed. I think we're quite always away from the fall. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday. Bloomberg. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1,000,000, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need.

Now, Facebook parent company Meta has made a number of acquisitions to bolster its offering in virtual and augmented reality. The chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said he wanted the company to popularize a metaverse, a more immersive version of the internet. However, my next guest believes that Meta's vision is misleading. In his new book, Virtual Society, there is the book. He argues that Mark Zuckerberg's company will not be the sole owner of the metaverse. Well, we're delighted to be joined by Herman and Rula, chief executive and co-founder of Inprobable. Last time we spoke, we were talking about the book and now it's out. So congratulations on that Herman. Overall, there was a lot of buzz on the metaverse. I wonder whether every day we talk about inflation, cost cutting, the cost of living crisis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1762,2022-10-11 08:40:55
13537," So congratulations on that Herman O'Viroll. There was a lot of buzz on the metaverse. I wonder whether every day we talk about inflation, cost cutting, you know, the cost of living crisis, and whether that's making a lot of the big companies less likely to spend millions of not billions in trying to work on the metaverse. I think for those working on the metaverse, yeah. But for those that are actually looking to create content within the world, it's the opposite. If you're a major sports league today, your attendance is going to be down in the context of people not being able to afford tickets or to travel. So the metaverse offers new opportunities for you to engage your audience at a much more cost-effective basis. But do you think it will be taken more years because of the cost of living crisis? I think it's already happening. You know, outside of Facebook, which gets all the attention, there are so many companies that are already making breakthroughs and everything from the economics of the metaverse through blockchain and Web3, through technology like ours, through a panel large scale. So I think it's happening with or without that investment at this stage. And I know in the book, you also argue that you look, the usual definitions of metaverse are, you know, confusing at best, unconvincing at worst. I mean, they are pretty vague. How do you describe the metaverse? And if you're like an advisor to Coca-Cola right now, then do you tell them to get in? I'd say the metaverse is simply this. It's a network of meaning that connects together different socially constructed realities. So it's really a way for something that happens in the world of sport or fashion to impact the real world or the impact of virtual space. It's a network of interconnected identities, objects, and interactions. So if you're a brand, then the metaverse is the ultimate way for you to engage with your audience because you can create embodied interactions with thousands of people can hang out with you, celebrities, the brand, and even engage in experiences that wouldn't normally be possible. So I would say it's about discovering a new scale, just like the origin of the internet kind of calls these brands to think differently about how they engage with people. I guess the only setback is that it could take a lot longer if you don't have someone like Google or Facebook fully behind it because of the infrastructure, right? It's a little bit like EVs. If you don't have the right infrastructure, then you're not going to reach the client as quickly and as most powerful as possible. I think that's a misconception. Earlier this year, we ran events with thousands of people hanging out in the metaverse, and it cost us less than $100 an hour to run these events with 15,000 people in them. So it doesn't take VR headsets and extremely expensive infrastructure to build vastly complex worlds. I think Facebook is looking in the wrong place. But this is what 0.1% of the population that have so far experienced it. And how big do you think it will become? Well, the game's industry is already more than 3 billion people. So if you look at the metaverse's VR, then yeah, of course it's an niche. But if you look at the metaverse as something you're going to access from your phone, from TV, from every possible device interacting with these interesting virtual worlds, we already have the infrastructure. We've already got game mentions. We've already got the networking technology. So I think it's a matter of time and not that long before we start to see experiences that darch people in their everyday lives. And I know we talked about this last time, first mover advantage. I don't know whether that's changed in terms of winners and losers. I think that this isn't going to be a market that is one by one centralized company. It's going to be one by a network. And I think that network is going to be rooted in blockchain and Web3 and in the idea of sharing value between businesses. That's a very new concept. And it's not something existing, behamoth, so well set up to take advantage of. So I don't know that it's going to look like the last disruption in terms of what guarantees victory. But do you see, I mean, I mentioned Coca-Cola. I could have mentioned a number of other big players. Do you see their commitment increasing to the metaverse or scaling back? Oh, absolutely increasing. I mean, it was recently announced that we're going to be profitable for the first time in my history. That's entirely based on companies making investments and building metaverses in virtual worlds with a two-year three at time horizon. You know, these are brands in fashion, in music, in film. And I see a clear gulf between those that are investing now and are going to have the advantage of having built and calibrated really effective experiences. And those that are going to be late comments and are going to be left behind. And you don't think, I mean, again, in our world, we talk about earnings and we talk about the concern that inflation will erode a lot of the margins for one of these big companies. You don't think that will have an impact on spending? Games tend to be recession proof because they're the cheapest form of entertainment. On a per-hour basis, games give you more activity for less dollars spent. You can do them from home. You can do them from anywhere in the world. You can interact without necessarily needing to travel. So in the last recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1763,2022-10-11 08:45:37
13538," give you more activity for less dollars spent. You can do them from home. You can do them from anywhere in the world. You can interact without necessarily needing to travel. So in the last recession, video games actually have been reasonably well. I personally think virtual experiences, especially if people start working from home as well, again, have become a much, much more effective use of capital. And I think a poor economy will only help it. Can Europe really rival China in some of the innovation in this space? Sure. I think, sorry, could you repeat the question then? So can Europe rival China? We know China is just doing quite a lot in this space. They do it cheaper, they have more data access and get things quicker. So as I argue a lot in the book, the value of the Metaverse comes from deep rich social experiences and self-expression. Those are pretty counter to the rules of building content in China. While China has a lot of advantages in terms of its tech companies and its investment, its desire for control over the experiences actually runs counter to building valuable experiences. Also, the content, the brands, the opportunities, the communities that are necessary to flourish for the Metaverse to flourish. I don't see them existing within that system. All right, Herman, so interesting. Thanks so much. And again, congratulations on the book, Herman Narula, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Improbable with the book Just Out. Now, let's also talk about geopolitics and foreign affairs. US President Biden has condemned what he calls the utter brutality of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine as Vladimir Putin warns of more taxable. Several cities include Kiev, where hit by a barrage yesterday, killing at least 11 people and wounding over 60. The strikes came after Putin blamed Ukraine for an attack on the bridge, linking Crimea to Russia. Let's get straight to Bloomberg's executive editor for International Government, Ross Matheson. So, Ross, is this actually a turning point in the war? Well, if anything, it's just another sign of the darker turn that this conflict is taking. If that's possible as a Russian President, Vladimir Putin's trips really struggle on the ground. Are there being backed out of parts of eastern Ukraine? They're struggling in southern Ukraine. And you can see that combined with the attack that happened on the weekend on that bridge to Crimea. A real prestige blow to Vladimir Putin and the pressure he's getting from hardliners at home. We can see the chorus growing on that. That suggests that he doesn't have a lot of options, that this is a moment where he's decided to dig in no matter what. He's decided that he's there. He needs to have some kind of outcome from this war that he can say that he gained something from it. And so, if anything, he's digging in. And that's heading us into a very difficult winter, obviously. And this move to target infrastructure by hitting multiple cities yesterday. The message was, we can still hit you no matter where you are in the far west of Ukraine, in the south of Ukraine. We have weapons and missiles that will find you. We're going to target civilians. We're going to target infrastructure. We're going to make life very difficult for people in Ukraine in the next couple of months. Thank you so much, Jor-Ros Matheson there, with the very latest, of course, on what's happening in Ukraine and Russia. She's an executive editor for government coverage. Now, coming up, how one city's policy is changing the makeup of its cars. We'll discuss today's big take on London's EV Boom. That's coming up next. And this is Bloomberg. When I started, I had no idea what it was going to turn into.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1764,2022-10-11 08:49:37
13539," When I started, I had no idea it was going to turn into this, just a trix new empire. I don't have any investor. All this is all money in. This is me going out in Hustlin, bringing that money back and just building it, building it, building it. Yeah, I think about a person that was homeless at one point. I didn't really have any money coming in. The fact that this person was relentless and just determined to succeed and not let rock bottom define him as an individual. I can take things and put them together and take them apart and make them better and put them back together. I respect the craft, so I don't want to minimize and disrespect the value of each step of the craft and do by machine what should be done by hand. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in, are we in some sort of sideflation fears? We're talking about that all day yesterday. Economics, finance, politics. This is Bloomberg surveillance, really addition of France and La Pellegrin in London. Now Germany is coming around to backing the idea of joint-a-U debt issuance to help caution the blow of the energy crisis. This is as long as money is dispersed as loans, not grants and that's according to a Bloomberg news scoop. Now, well, details have not been ironed out yet. The topic will likely come up in the discussions as you leaders meet in Brussels next week. Now for more, we're joined by Maria today in Brussels. So, Maria, exactly what exactly is being debated? And good morning. Yeah. Good morning to you, two friends. And you meet out what is a critical difference here. I think you explained it very well. This is about the loans. It's not the grants. So in other words, it's not a rerun of the recovery fund. This won't be a recovery fund 2.0 that was 750 billion years back in 2020. Remember the amount was split. Some was grants the other was loans. The idea here, however, is that you could see European institutions tap markets that is triple A-Ratin and then get the funding and distribute that to member states that are now crystal clear. They will need additional help to deal with the winter crisis. The core issue, and this is fundamentally the thinking behind this, is that if you tap the market as EU27, you'll get a better funding rate than you would if you're, let's say, a peripheral country going out to the markets by yourself. So that's where the debate is at, but I should note, however, this is something that would have to be presumably agreed by the EU27 unanimously. And it's clear that we're not there yet. We just played an interview with the Dutch Finance Minister, which she said very openly, she does not see the need for new tools to deal with this crisis. Maria, change, of course, of heart in Germany is very important, but not definitive. So will there be enough consensus? Yeah, and it's not definitive. And again, I should also note that the German government has not made this position official. This is a story that broke yesterday on the Bloomberg citing a number of sources, but officially, all of Schalz has not said this on the record. But the choreography now, friends, seen from now until next week, will be that today the energy ministers will meet at one point, the commission will come up with a plan of action that may or may not include this. That will be a key point. And then it's up to European leaders next week on October 20th and 21st to really figure out what type of response they're going to put up with this energy crisis and what type of what consensus they can build around some of the measures that are being floated pretty much every day. I should say in Brussels, this is a very active debate here. Yeah, I'm certainly isn't, of course, I mean a lot of traders.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1765,2022-10-11 08:53:52
13540," that are being floated pretty much every day I should say in Brussels. This is a very active debate here. Yeah, I'm certainly isn't of course. I mean a lot of traders were, you know, forwarding that Bloomberg scoop yesterday because it's definitely a game to change the potential European correspondent Maria Tadeo in Brussels for us. Now London's polluted air turned the city into an electric vehicle pioneer. Today's big day explains that in a bid to tackle the capital's traffic congestion, the city introduced some of the toughest restrictions on heavily polluting cars. Now the policies on this flipped a switch on the adoption of electric vehicles. Now let's bring in Bloomberg's Crachadel for more on the story. Greg, I'm really happy to speak to you about this because over the last three weeks, there's such bad news coming out of the UK. If I'm 100% on it, this is actually a feel good good news. So what are some of the conversations that you've been having about the impact that's had for EV? Yeah, for me, this really started a few months ago when Uber was eager to talk about why they were having such great progress in the fleet in the city of London, turning over. And a lot of companies want to tell a feel good story about how things are improving within their operations. But this one really stuck out to me because of the long and tumultuous history of Uber in London. There's been a lot of tension between the mayor's office and this company. But the company really spoke effusively about this idea that road pricing policies was a huge distinguishing factor and sort of a driving force in why electric vehicles were having so much more success on the platform. You don't necessarily have a big difference in terms of incentives. The charging infrastructure is coming along, but it isn't necessarily way ahead of other places. The reason why London has had such success in drivers going out and getting electric vehicles is it really costs a lot to drive in the city every day unless you're driving an EV now. So is it at prescription that other parts of the world and other metropolis is can I be right? Yeah, there's absolutely going to be an effort to replicate this elsewhere. Even in New York City, there's been a lot of talk about that and not necessarily a lot of follow through. But we've been sort of assured that this is going to be tried again in New York City. The idea that a company like Uber, where you wouldn't necessarily think that this policy would be in their business interests, the idea that they've come forward and talk about the fact that this has been such a big driving force and then being able to achieve their sustainability goals does give you some hope that maybe some other cities will try this out because they're seeing the results from the city of London and also perhaps getting some pressure from the private sector and companies like Uber. I was in Amsterdam yesterday and actually what was in the Tesla was a taxi. It's always a bit fiddly because you don't know how to open the door. Yes. You know, I feel like you're doing something for the environment. Yeah, you're actually, we're hearing about that. Now that there's a big push with Uber actually in the US with more Hertz cars or interesting. It's a real thing. Yes. It's not just blonde Francine. Craig, thank you so much. Craig Trudeau there. Of course, our European car, sorry. Now Bloomberg surveillance early edition continues in the next hour. Matt Miller, Kayley Lines in New York or Anna Edwards is here in London. I know they'll spend a lot of time talking about the markets, they'll also spend a lot of time looking and hearing about this B.O.E. intervention. We just heard from Neil Wilson, for example, great analysis on what it means for the Bank of England. Today, why do you think it's GILTS market intervention to counter what it says is the material risk to the UK financial stability? So the B.O.E. now, including indexland GILTS in the basket of assets, it purchased as part of the intervention in the wake of the Chancellor's mini-budget. But will they have to go step for a really critical question for today? This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1766,2022-10-11 08:58:21
13541," y you So the inflation environment has been changing a little bit. Inflation has been very low for 25 years. Now people think inflation is coming back. How are you going to deal with that? I think many of the tools that we've historically used to battle inflation no longer work in the same ways they used to. I think people oftentimes thought of housing as a way or especially retail. And real estate is a way to hedge against inflation. Less and less possible the way we've invested in it. I think commodity similarly have been thought of as a way to hedge against inflation. Their challenges over the long-term equities have been a hedge against inflation. We will continue to do what we have done in the past, which is build a diversified portfolio, where there are many different opportunities that have the possibility of hedging against inflation. Because different types of inflation have to be hedged in different ways. So if it's a very quick increase in inflation as opposed to a slow rise of inflation, is it temporary? Is it a long and persistent type of inflation? So for us, I never model myself an economist that can predict where inflation is going. And so what I need to do is build a diversified portfolio where there are different options that can fight the different types of inflation and to pay close attention to it. And fundamentally, it's done through the equity markets. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, where you're always, always learning. I'm the world of politics to the world of business. That's great question. Remember top experts, great questions. Oh, it has now endorsed notion that there is going to be some pain involved. This is an environment where the phone market vigilantes are back. You probably don't want to be the one validating market expectations of the recession. You probably don't want to add to the general bleakness in the system. I think there's there's worse to come for the market, unfortunately. The biggest concern, the dollar, is what is requiring other central banks to do, in terms of tightening when their own economies are looking to head into potentially severe recessions. And then a financial accident. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition, with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller, and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York, and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong are top stories today. More intervention, the Bank of England, as inflation linked bonds to its purchases to stabilize the market and avoid what it calls fire sale dynamics. broader guilt yields have been dropping after yesterday's climb.

13542," Dynamics, broader guilt yields have been dropping after yesterday's climb. A $240 billion wipeout, chipmaker Storks slumped in Asia, hurt by continued fallout from the fresh US curves on China's access to technology. And a Bloomberg scooped Germany's Chancellor Olaf Schultz and makes a shift. He's now supporting joint EU debt issuers with conditions to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. Welcome to Bloomberg's Availants Early Edition. I'm Anna Edwards and London with Matt Miller and Kayleigh Lines in New York and Kayleigh, another day, another intervention from the Bank of England and risk of an issue to the foreseen here in Europe. Yeah, and that was definitely the case in Asia overnight. And a lot of it driven from that semiconductor store you were just mentioning Anna, a lot of pain for the chip stocks out there. And as you had markets like Taiwan, South Korea and Japan opening up after holidays on Monday, they were catching up to some of those real losses we have seen over the last day or so. And that was on this bench, Mark Stocking next down about 4.4 percent of the war stays since March of 2020 now at its lowest level since November of that year. And of course, a lot of that had to do with Taiwan's semiconductor down a record, 8.3 percent overnight really speaks to the chip pain that is out there. And that is filtering through to foreign exchange as well, both the Taiwanese dollar in Asia, as well as the South Korean one, as you have the likes of Samsung lacking on the day too, are under pressure. And that's what the Korean one actually at $14.35 to the dollar that is relatively weak, not quite at the weakest levels we have seen so far this year, but still we're getting close back up to that point. And of course, in the bond market, we have seen a lot of selling pressure in global bonds around the world. And that definitely was true in the Asia Pacific region, including in Australia, where that 10-year yield rose 17 basis points to 4.03 percent. All right, well, we're seeing big yields here as well in the US. First off, futures are down another 8-10s of 1 percent. So it looks like we could come back under 3,600 this morning. And then we're seeing the 10-year yield up at almost 4 percent. It's at 394.09 right now, but pushing up against that level to 2-year yield at its highest level since 2007 at more than 431 right now. TimeX crude trading TI at 8874, a barrel. So it's come off a little bit on concerns that demand will drop in a recession. And Bitcoin is down 7-10s of a percent, but still hanging around the same trading band where we've seen it. 19108 can anything knock Bitcoin off of this out of this range? It doesn't seem like anything has over the last few weeks at least. And what do you see in Europe? Yeah, we'll get to another Bitcoin conversation. A crypto-wide-acrypto conversation later in the program, won't you Matt? In Europe, I see red, plenty of red, negativity across European equity markets, the London market, weighed down by its emphasis on energy stocks and basic resources. And with that in mind, I'll show you what I've picked out to talk about here on the European space right now. There is a concern around growth today and as a result, basic resource stocks down by 2.5 percent. It's the same concern around growth weighing on Brent crude. 9383, despite the fact we saw OPEC of course decided to cut back on production. That was last week's story today, the growth concerns seem to be dominating at least today. Now here is where a lot of the interest is, a lot of the action is and I mean broadly in the UK guilt market. What we have seen today is the Bank of England widening what it's going to do this week in terms of buying up guilt assets, adding inflation link guilt. We'll get more detail on this from Danny Berger in just a moment. But I just wanted to flag what's going on with the crucial 30-year guilt yield because we talked about this yesterday being just above 4.5. We then saw all across the UK curve. We saw those guilt yields rise yesterday. Today the action from the Bank of England did seem to be enough to bring the guilt yields down in the very short term but not now at the 30-year. That's where we've seen the 30-year behave a little bit differently and just trying to move in the other direction. Credit Suisse also in focus today up by 1.7 percent. Goldman Sachs analysts then trying to put a figure, a number on the amount of capital that this business needs to raise. We wait to October 27th to get the full restructuring and reorganization of the business. But in the meantime, Goldman Sachs saying they need 8 billion Swiss francs, that's around 8 billion US dollars. Yeah, and we're hearing other analysts as well say they need that much or even more, right? Nine billion has been called at another shop. So watch closely Credit Suisse shares today. Let's get more though on the B.O.E. as it expanded its emergency measures to tackle chaos in the bond market. We're on the out the scope with linkers now added.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1768,2022-10-11 09:07:10
13543," B.O.E. as it expanded its emergency measures to tackle chaos in the bond market, broadened out the scope with linkers now added. Alan Higg and CIO at Coots spoke earlier on Bloomberg. I worry they haven't done enough. Quite frankly, I mean what we saw yesterday was an extraordinary move in GILTS and ridiculous move in index link GILTS. And yeah, you've got a real spiral here. I worry that this is not enough and I think they're going to have to come up with their version of whatever it takes. Bloomberg, Danny Burger joins us now for more so maker break for the Bank of England says Alan Higgins. Yeah, I mean it's just a bank of England here whose purpose, sole purpose at this moment at least is making sure this is not a dysfunctional market. It is monetary policy for the sake of stability. And here's the ridiculous move as Alan Higgins put it for our radio listening audience. It's the daily moved in those linkers, those 10 year UK inflation linked bonds. Moving 64 basis points yesterday, a record move. That is not something that can be explained by fundamentals. This is a market that is extremely tense considering the Bank of England didn't have linkers in its purchase program previously. So the market is testing it and of course those infamous now infamous LDIs, they hold a lot of these linkers. So the leveraging continues. And throughout the Bank of England statement and the notes attached to this statement, it keeps saying stability over and over again, they wrote dysfunction in this market. And the prospect of self-reinforcing fire sale dynamics pose a material risk to UK financial stability. But this brings it back around to Alan Higgins point. Is it enough? Look, the bond market is calm today in the UK, but it is noteworthy that we are seeing the long end of the curve. Some of those gains are starting to peter out. We're not even down one basis point. Yes, belly of the curve is seeing some bids. So the fundamental problem remains, Kaylee. It is a market concerned whether these pensions have delivered enough, considering they didn't take the BOE up on many of their purchases. And a market that is testing the central bank, considering these moves are really against what their aim is to bring inflation down. Dare we say vigilantes Bloomberg, Stanie Burger, thank you so much. Now let's turn to the chip space. A whopping $240 billion has been wiped off the market value of the global semiconductor sector. Chipper-related stocks in Asia have plunged after the Biden administration imposed curves on China's access to semiconductor technology. Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie is joining us now with more. Tom, this is absolutely brutal. And of course, it's not just a matter of the Biden administration's moves, the earnings picture and demand picture for these companies is also not looking good. It's looking bleak, isn't it, Kaylee? You touched on some of the key points at the top of the show. Of course, some of these markets, as you say, waking up after a national holiday is, and so you see that route as they digest the news from the US. Of course, there's more than 100 page document that came out of Washington on Friday. So you saw that impact on the likes of TSMC over in Taiwan. You saw that impact on Samsung TSMC ending the session down. I'm more than 8% across the industry, 240 billion. And then you mentioned this as well. The ripple across to the currencies because the importance of the chip making industry and that sector to the economies of Taiwan and Korea in particular. There was a read across also to the chip makers and the producers of some of these ultra-viral, ultra-violet lithography machines, particularly ASML here in Europe. That is lower. The last on my check. SD Micro over in France and in Finland, Germany also taking a hit. Morningstar, the analyst there saying, look, there are going to be more uncertainties for this sector. To your point, it's not just the restrictions put in place by the Biden administrations. It's also the fact that there is now very weak demand for consumer electronics. So that's a further drag. China's response is also something we're watching for. All right, Tom. Thanks very much for that. Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie. They're talking to us about what's going on in China with chip stocks. Really, it's a global issue. President Biden on another issue has condemned what he calls the utter brutality of Russian missile strikes across Ukraine as Vladimir Putin mourns of more attacks. In a call with Ukrainian President, the Vladimir Zelensky, Biden says the U.S. would continue providing Ukraine the support it needs, including advanced air defense systems. Meanwhile, on the energy front, Germany is coming back around to the idea of backing joint EU debt issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1769,2022-10-11 09:11:19
13544," systems. Meanwhile, on the energy front, Germany is coming back around to the idea of backing joint EU debt issuance to help cushion the blow of the energy crisis. This is as long as the money is dispersed to other countries as loans, not as grants or giveaways according to a Bloomberg news scoop. All details have not been ironed out just yet. The topic will likely come up at the discussions as EU leaders meet in Brussels next week. Let's get to our European correspondent Maria today. Oh, in Brussels for more. So Maria, what are we talking about here? More EU shared debt. Yeah, but Matt, this is critical to get the new ones here. And in fact, it has been in the public debate now for a week. Last week on the Monday, Tuesday, when the Eurogroup was meeting in Luxembourg and I covered that meeting to me, it became obvious that something behind the scenes was cooking. And what you have here is potentially now an opening that would see joint debt, but this is not a replay of the recovery fund 2.0. This is not going to be the same thing. Remember at the time, this was the pandemic and this was a huge mega fund that was funded by the EU. It had grants and loans. The idea here is that facing this energy crisis has become obvious that member states of the EU will need additional funding and additional resources and the key is at what rate now some countries are suggesting it's better to do it as EU27. You will get a better rate in the market, especially if you compare it to per-year-old countries. I mean, find it difficult to do that by themselves. Now, what the Germans are suggesting is that this is something they could explore, but I would note also one thing. If Germany opens up, you get political momentum going into this, but you also need to factor this is a decision that will have to agree or be agreed unanimously by the EU27 as it always gets done. And yesterday when I spoke to the Dutch Finance Minister, she frankly wasn't so keen. So this is still a story that is to be plead. Okay, so different to the fund that we saw put in place during COVID, a bit more similar to the SHALL program that predated it than Maria. So a change of heart, some evidence of a change of heart in Germany, that does seem important, but is there enough consensus around that? Yes, Anna, it's not the recovery fund. It's the sure. I was trying to avoid the tiny casualties, but you beat it to me and yes, that's exactly what it is. This was a program that preceded the recovery fund, which was in many ways eclipsed by the magnitude of this fund. But, you know, in terms of the choreography, going forward to answer your question, I think things will have to move in the next two weeks. The commission has been given a deadline to come up with a plan to deal with the escalating cost of the energy crisis. Energy ministers are meeting today. At one point, this plan will have to be presented to the different nations of the EU. And then we're expecting, remember, this is what we heard from the French President last week, come October 20th and 21st. This is decision time. There has got to be something on the table that they're able to make a joint decision. So really, this is two weeks right predict there's going to be a lot of back and forth between Brussels, Paris, Berlin and the different capitals. All right, the clock is ticking and we trust that you'll be there for us reporting on every single move. Limburg's Maria today out in Brussels. Thank you so much. Now, let's get back to the equity markets and take a look at some stocks moving in pre-market trading here in the U.S. I want to begin with Las Vegas Sands, which saw a pretty sizable down day yesterday, down about 7.5 percent after data showed that golden week in China in terms of tourism was pretty disappointing. And that doesn't have great implications for the gambling enclave, enclave Macau, where Las Vegas Sands gets more than 60 percent of its revenue. So after the big declines of yesterday, we are seeing those losses continuing this morning down about 3.4 percent before the bell. Now, we also are seeing a lot of commodities moving south to including oil and that is weighing on energy names in early hours, the likes of ExxonMobil down about 1.8 percent. And then finally, to bring it back to the semiconductor story we were just discussing with Tom McKenzie, of course, the pain not limited to Asia was felt here in the U.S. over the last several days. In video, the big large cap US shipmaker down 11 percent in the last two sessions and those losses continuing this morning down about 1.5 percent before the bell. Kaylee, we will get back to the conversation around bond markets shortly. We'll talk to Nicola Mai, Pimco Portfolio Manager and software and credit analysts, a great guest to talk to.

13545," credit and less a great guess to talk to. A day after we saw the biggest ever surge higher in inflation linked guilt yield. The Bank of England is stepping into the market today across the regular guilt curve. We see a bit of calm but maybe not quite at the long end. We'll get the views of Nicola Mai shortly. Anthony Trenchev also joins us next. So co-founder, we'll talk about the state of crypto as we head deeper into a winter perhaps. Plus how London's polluted air turned the city into an electric vehicle pioneer. Read more in today's big take story on BlueBerg.com or on the BlueBerg terminal. This is BlueBerg. When you think space you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Commander ground for your copy. Copy. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live and work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. Can ESA help humanity take its next giant leap? You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a BlueBerg. I've seen the BlueBerg. They have been in and seen it. Lots of BlueBergs. I've seen the BlueBerg. I've seen the BlueBerg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a BlueBerg. Welcome back to BlueBerg's Surveillance. The early edition I'm Matt Miller with Kayleigh Lions here in New York and Edwards with us at a London. We are seeing liquidity worsened pretty much everywhere, but it's very bad in the UK, which those of you watching on TV can see here in blue and in Italy, which you can see in yellow. Those of you listening on Radio just take my word for it or when you get to your BlueBerg terminal type G hashtag BTV 4289 to see this chart. Now, Cassandra Galuchko joins us right now. BlueBerg equities editor to talk about what this lack of bond market liquidity is going to mean for the equity market. So far it's not been good news, Cassandra. That's right. It's been another dramatic day in UK markets with a bank of England coming out with another support measure and being willing to buy up those inflation linked guilds. Again, right now they've managed to stabilize the market after this major sell off on Monday. But again, the deadline for the expiration of their bond buying program is this Friday. So we might see more volatility around that. And although I'm focusing on the bond market right now, of course there's repercussions for the broader financial markets in the UK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1771,2022-10-11 09:19:42
13546," is this Friday so we might see more volatility around that. And although I'm focusing on the bond market right now, of course there's repercussions for the broader financial markets in the UK and equities also. Of course the FUTU 100 does benefit from the weaker pounds, but the FUTU 250, the mid cap, the more domestically focused index remains under pressure. Okay, and because then you're good morning, so that's the bond market, it's the really cross-insert equities. I'm looking at a headline here that says earnings are looking bad, but what's coming could be even worse. Sounds gloomy, explain. Oh my God, yes, so strategies are quite spooked about the upcoming earnings season. They say that the third quarter earnings no longer matter because it's all about the guidance for the companies. So they're going to be looking out for those warnings. We've got many problems in place. We've got surging inflation, labor costs, supply constraints, that margin pressures, all of these things are going to come and play and say the earnings season kicks off this Friday with JP Morgan, Citibank, and we will see how things go. This could put more pressure on the equity market, which is already struggling quite a bit. With the S&P 500, we'll hit possibly another November 2020 low this week. Well, before we can get to JP Morgan on Friday, though, because then we have to get through inflation data on Thursday, which is going to be crucial in terms of how this market is thinking about federal reserve policy. What could it mean for the policy pivot narrative that Goldman Sachs says it's too early for? Absolutely, yes, and Goldman and other strategies are warning that this whole pivot narrative that did drive a recovery in the summer. And also, in the early days of October, is going to be flawed. And inflation is likely to come in high again, possibly higher than expectations, even, because we have seen oil prices come up recently because of the opaque deal that did drive up the oil prices. So inflation is going to stay sticky for now. And in general, with the labor market remaining very robust, we saw from data on Friday, the Fed is unlikely to pivot. And I think Powell has been very clear in his message that they're going to stay on their hawkish path. OK, because then you thank you very much, Bimba.

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Kayleigh Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world here is the first word. More allegations in the Elon Musk Twitter battle. Bloomberg has learned that just before the billionaire revived his proposal to buy the social media company, he accused Twitter of ordering a whistleblower to destroy evidence. According to court filings, Pierre Erichsatko said he burned 10 hundred notebooks and deleted 100 computer files at the request of managers as part of $7.8 million dollar severance package. Japan has reopened its border today to vaccinate the travelers from 68 countries, ending almost three years of pandemic restrictions. With a weekend and relatively low inflation, hopes are high for a rebound in visitor numbers as airlines ramp up international flights. Meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party's flagship newspaper endorsed the country's COVID-0 policy for a second day in a row, dousing hopes that President Xi Jinping will relax controls soon after a key political meeting later this week. The report calls the policy, quote, sustainable and says the country must stick to the strategy because it's key to stabilizing the economy and protecting lives. And the heads of the IMF and World Bank are warning of rising risk of a global recession. IMF managing director Kristalina Gorgiava says higher interest rates are adding to debt pressures on developing nations. She says about a third of the world economy will enter recession this year or next. And it speaks to the policy dilemma for both monetary and fiscal policy makers, Matt, in that inflation is the problem everyone was first focused on. The policies you use to fight inflation are going to mean a hit to growth. Yeah, absolutely. And I mean, the idea is they should have been using these policies earlier than they wouldn't have had to use such heavy blunt tools to fight inflation. But now it's too late. And the only thing they can do is cause a recession in order to end inflation. Yes, and we heard Jamie Dimon adding his voice to those gloomy calls and Ben Bonanke, both voices cautioning about what we need to watch out for as the global economy slows down. I spoke to Alan Higgins. We heard a little bit from him earlier on in the program. I spoke to him in earlier programming here in Europe from Kutzenko. And he was saying yes, he's concerned about these global forecasts of doom. But also that markets have been well aware of this for some time. And that perhaps the market narrative is a little bit ahead of that. We're still looking for that pivot. Say it quietly. I know we're not supposed to say that word too loud these days. Right. Nicola Mai joins us shortly. Pimco, portfolio manager and sovereign credit. Analysts.

13548," Intro Today, what are the biggest challenges for general dynamics and what are the biggest opportunities? So I think in any business, the challenges are solving complex problems that come to you. You know, the problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and nevelsome. So your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element, I think of the value that we add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? You know, the why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. And making creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible and we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. I get all night. Remember, top experts, great questions. This is Bloomberg's surveillance, early edition. Here's what you need to know. More intervention, the B.O.E. ad inflation linked bonds to its purchases to stabilize the market and avoid what it calls fire sale dynamics, broader guilt yields drop after yesterday's climb. A $240 billion wipeout, chip makers stocks slumped in Asia hurt by continued fallouts from the fresh US curves on China's access to technology. And a Bloomberg scoop, Germany's chancellor Olaf Schultz makes a shift. He's now appointing joint EU debt issuers with conditions to cushion the blow of the energy crisis. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayley Lines in New York, continue to try to find solutions to the European energy crisis their map. But here and now in the markets, a lot of risk aversion, gloom and doom being talked about quite a lot. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we see continued drops even after the fall in the cash trade yesterday. The continued drop in the cash trade yesterday and now futures are off 8-10s of 1% this morning. So down below 3600 and we came down pretty close to that in the cash trade yesterday. The 10-year yield rises right now at 394.49. I believe it's gone all the way to 399. Yeah. Yes, thank you, Kayley. I'm 24%. Chuck, Chuck, taking the 4% level, but we haven't really gone through that. So we're on 4% watch, I guess. The 2-year yield is the highest since 2000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1774,2022-10-11 09:32:59
13549," 24% Chattig in the 4% level but we haven't really gone through that so we're on 4% Watch I guess the two-year yield is the highest since 2007 up to 431 in the three or at 435 right now. Now I'm ex-crewed coming down on those recession concerns. Jamie Dimon said yesterday on CMBC expect a recession in six to nine months. Of course a lot of people think we already had a recession depending on how you define it nonetheless 88 71 is the level there the China concerns have to play into this as well because of the restrictions Biden put on their technology sector they said that their recovery will be slowed and then Bitcoin you know it hasn't moved out of this 20,000 range 19,000 81 for a while I didn't want to put it in here anymore because it wasn't changing now I think it's interesting that it isn't I mean we just don't see Bitcoin breaking out of this trading range Kayleigh. Yeah it's interesting and we've heard from a couple of voices that that may be due to the fact that you are seeing more institutions in the space rather than just retail investors and those institutional investors may act as somewhat of a stabilizing force that is a conversation we will continue in just a moment here on early edition and of course you and I will have more on that on Bloomberg crypto later today as for what is happening right now in pre-market trading this morning you're seeing energy under pressure with oil prices down as Matt was talking about the likes of marathon oil oxen and oil petroleum each down in the ballpark of about semi-conductors a number of factors here one being the Biden administration curves on US technology to Chinese chipmakers so that could rattle supply chains and and potentially damage the revenue operations of US chip makers who do business in China but then also you have to consider the earnings picture with a lot of warnings out of these companies about slowing demand so that is putting continued pressure on the space and video down 11% in the last two days already down another one and a half percent this morning and advanced micro devices all slow down by about 1.3% before the bell in a Kaley here in Europe we see continued pressure on European stocks broadly many sectors in negative territory today down by 1.1% basic resource stocks energy stocks all of those feeling the pressure as we see weaker commodity prices growth concerns very much to the four here in Europe today and this is what's going on with the yields on the 30-year guilt here in the UK and what and actually this stands in contrast what we're seeing at other tenors of the curve here in the UK so we heard yesterday from the Bank of England they were confirming their ending their bond buying program on the the middle of this month but then they added another program that will run till early November today they had to that didn't suit the markets quite enough we saw guilt yields moving higher yesterday today they came forward with another program we heard about this from Danny Berger a little bit earlier on this is inflation link guilt added into their existing programs and now buying those as well trying to stabilize those stopping the search higher in yields we're seeing there and so what that did is it did actually suit the markets a little bit and we've seen that the yields have been coming down across much of the UK curve but not at the 30-year where we are seeing some selling of 30-year guilt and the yield going up as you can see credit suites up by 1.2% and this is of course in the run up to the 27th of October when we get the full restructuring announcement from credit suites Goldman Sachs though trying to put a number on the amount of capital this business needs to raise they say eight billion Swiss francs the US dollars almost the same and so they're putting on a number on it but maybe some people had a bigger number and might the stock is higher all right we'll continue to watch that story for sure among the most read on the Bloomberg terminal I want to go go though back to the bond market right now let's talk to Nicola my Pymco portfolio manager and sovereign credit analyst and those sovereign credits are getting more and more expensive or I guess yielding more depending on your view Nicola how do you see the rising yield environment yeah I mean I think the rising yields first of all is a very good opportunity for bond investors that haven't seen these levels of yields in 1520 years I mean after minimum record lows for bond yields we now have bonds that actually are interesting in terms of what's priced in the market I think I think the higher yields reflect the central bank credibility and their commitment to fighting inflation and I think the kind of yields we're seeing now like maybe four and a half percent peak rate for the Fed 575 for the Bank of England 3% for the ECB tend to be close to what we think are enough to actually bring inflation",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1775,2022-10-11 09:37:25
13550," percent peak rate for the Fed, 575 for the Bank of England, 3 percent for the ECB, tend to be close to what we think are enough to actually bring inflation back down to target. Nicola, can I home in on the UK with you here? We're just getting some interesting newslines coming through which I'll add into the conversation. The pensions and lifetime savings association in the UK, and we know that a lot of what the Bank of England is doing is focused around the pension industry. That particular organisation is saying that some pension funds want the Bank of England to extend its bond buying. We know that the initial programme is due to come to an end on Friday, on the 14th of October. Just as we see those comments come through from the PLSA, I note that guilt yields have suddenly turned. I know now on the rise everywhere across the curve apart from the three-year. What are you expecting to see then from the Bank of England? I guess the Bank of England with its guilt purchase programme which started on the 28th of September and was actually expanded today to include the linkers, it shows the central bank commitment, as you say, to stabilise the pension fund sector and LDI investors specifically. Now, it's very possible that the programme which, as you say, is due to end on Friday will be extended and I think that the Bank of England will be ready to do that. I think it's important to remember that this is a financial stability operation. It's really a liquidity operation, which is independent of its monetary policy. So I think while continuing to provide liquidity, it will be important for the central bank to reassert its commitment to bringing inflation back to target. And that is with its policy rate adjustments and not with these measures. Okay. So you say this is financial stability liquidity operation, it's not monetary policy, but monetary policy is looking like it needs to keep moving in the opposite direction. We got UK unemployment data today that showed the lowest level of unemployment in this country since 1974 and that was a lower level of unemployment than had been expected, a tighter labour market than had been expected, Nicola. Is there a worry for you about what the Bank of England is doing in this part of the market versus the tightening course it needs to be on elsewhere? Not necessarily. I think that if they help with liquidity in the long end of the curve, that's fine and needed in a way as long as, as you say, as long as they actually show commitment to bringing inflation down. I mean, you're right that the labour market report will show the very tight labour market. Now vacancies are coming down and employment looks to be slowing, but at the same time, labour force participation remains very low, which means that there has been a destruction of labour supply, which means that there is too much heat in the labour market. So I think as long as the Bank of England continues to raise the policy rate, as we expect they will do, these liquidity operations can come alongside it. Nicola, to widen the lens back out, you mentioned the opportunity you now see in the bond market that the case is getting stronger for investing in bonds. Could you get more specific as to where and where you might still be avoiding? Yeah, so generally speaking, I would say that, I mean, right now we're not, we're not taking super strong positions on on duration, meaning on interest rate risk, because there's still some uncertainty as to when and where inflation will peak. But generally speaking, we are, we are thinking that the levels we're seeing and what I'm talking about, treasure yields as well as gilt yields as well as bund yields, you know, the levels we're seeing are getting more and more interesting. And as we get more and more evidence that inflation is brought under control, I think there's going to be very good opportunities for investors. I also think there are opportunities in the in the spreads in the corporate spread space in the in the credit space, let's put it that way. We would really focus on high quality right now because we are expecting a recession. In Europe, it's almost guaranteed, it's very very likely, but it's also more likely than not in the US. So we would tend to favor high quality credits over lower quality credits. We like structured products which tend to have protection and decent yields. We also tend to like high-quality financials where we see good opportunities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1776,2022-10-11 09:41:33
13551," which tend to have protection and decent yields. We also tend to like high quality financials where we see good opportunities. We also like some names in the emerging market space but you want to be very selective there while the Fed is still hiking interest rates. Okay, Nicola, thanks so much. Thanks for joining us. Nicola, my of PIMCO, talking to us about guilt markets, treasuries and beyond. When we come back, we'll get back to the crypto conversation. Anthony Trenchev joins us next so's co-founder. What have the stresses and strains in the crypto space of late Dante his business? How is his business right now? We'll talk about that next. This is going back. If you do any kind of business in this country, there's a pretty good chance that you're going to see that business registered in Delaware. Why? Because that's where you do it. And our point was Wyoming can be that venue for blockchains and enterprise for crypto. It's not the Wyoming way to sit around and wait for change. We want that independence, we want that freedom, we want that individuality. And that's a common theme that brings together bipartisan support for this in Wyoming. We want to make sure that people understand, especially in Wyoming, but as the United States as a whole, this trend is coming. It's not going to stop. This is more of a small town that's growing into, but I would call the cryptocurrency version of Silicon Valley. It's the philosophy of that rugged individualism, the independence, and the ability to really get things done for yourself and control your own destiny. You get that from a blockchain, and you don't get that without it. MUSIC Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. The macro backdrop is really affecting us, just as it's affecting every other asset cost, just as we've seen in your graph there. What does that look like going forward? How does this win? How cold does this win to get? Well, I think it's highly dependent on the macro situation, the Fed policy makers in Europe, policy makers in the UK. Now, idiosyncratic cryptos, we've seen plenty, you've reported on plenty over the last few months. We think the leverage is out of this system now, for the most part, we don't see any massive shoes to drop. Tim Grant, their head of Imiya at Galaxy Digital Speaking with us yesterday, joining us now for more on the crypto space, Anthony Trenchev, co-founder of Crypto Lender, next, so very nice to speak to you, Anthony. And we want to get into a conversation about your business specifically, about regulatory thoughts. But I want to ask you first about what Tim was just talking about there, about what's driving the crypto prices at the moment. He was saying he was facing up to the winter and saying it's been tough macro backdrop, but he thinks that a lot of the leverage is out of the system and he doesn't see another shoe to drop. We've seen quite stable Bitcoin prices recently. What's your view? Yeah, no, I completely concur with that view. The macro backdrop is what ultimately drives the market right now. Unfortunately, there has been some correlation direct between overall equities and crypto. Leverage is definitely out of the system. That's why we haven't seen any sort of drop bill.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1777,2022-10-11 09:45:50
13552," between overall equities and crypto. Leverage is definitely out of the system. That's why we haven't seen any sort of drop below the lower range of around $19,000 and we need some new impulses to get us through the higher barrier of around 25, which is the higher amount. Okay. Anthony, let me ask you about some of the things that have been going on from a regulatory perspective. Several states alleging that last month, alleging last month's story that Nexo offered its interest bearing crypto products to customers without first registering them as securities. Also suggesting there was misrepresentation as a license and regulated company. I mean, how are you responding to those kind of criticisms? We pride ourselves in our four-hour transparency and this is the approach we have always had with regulators. We are cooperating, providing the necessary and requested data in a timely manner. I was quite surprised that they decided to go public about something that has been ongoing for over a year now. We have been talking to Federer and state regulators figuring out what if anything we have done wrong in the past, but more importantly, how the path forward looks like. And that is what's got me terribly excited because it's one thing. It's clear it is that they want the earned interest product in the U.S. In compliance with the regulatory framework, which is now shaping up nicely and clearly. And this is the good news, is crypto and earned interest product in the United States is here to stay and will be brought into its two-point-all version. How long do you think this fight with regulators, though, is going to be drawn out, Anthony, both here in the U.S. and do you expect other regulators, other jurisdictions, to have the same issues? Matt, you know I would love to talk about that, but you also know that I cannot talk about that, and as soon as I can, I will be on the first light to New York to have a sit down with you and discuss it in person. The invitation is always there. It's a standing invitation, Anthony. Let me ask about the yield, then. You know, when I first talked to you, now I don't know how many years ago, I was astounded by the yields that you were offering, and it's been a huge draw for your products. Those yields are now a lot lower, and we see a lot of other plain vanilla yielding instruments much higher. The 10-year, as Kayleigh was saying earlier, went over 4%. What are you seeing in terms of the relationship or the demand that investors have for your products now as plain vanilla bonds yield so much more? Yeah, well, we have to consider that these yields are on fiat currencies only, so our offering for interest on digital assets remains very attractive, and we are one of the very few players that provide it, so no change on that if anything, new players are coming in. What are the levels you're offering right now, Anthony? Can you quote some? We are offering up to 12%, depending on the structure of your portfolio and your loyalty tiers, but 12% is something you can get on fiat currencies up to 8 on Bitcoin and Ethereum. So still higher than what most banks would have, even with the push of the Federal Reserve and the Central Banks, and institutions are coming in. Right now it is not a retail driven market. It's more institutional driven market, and they play against it. That's why you don't see the slump below 1917,000, because old institutions are coming on to buy it up. All right, so maybe blame the institutions for making the space a little more boring, or maybe that makes it more interesting. Anthony, and I began the conversation talking about the difficulties many crypto companies have faced. A lot of leverage. We've seen a lot of projects just collapsing entirely. You have pushed back on speculation about any kind of difficulty financially that Nexo is having. Can you give us more insight into your runway? And if regulatory issues here in the US inhibit your ability to offer some products here, what would that mean? Sure, we are in great shape, and this means that we have a very strong balance sheet. This means that we are the only crypto lender to have a real time audit on our reserves to show that our assets exceed liabilities at all times. And what we talked about earlier, everybody that was going to go bust, has gone bust, and we came out of this unscattered, not only that, but we are in a position to help Rothech, with Schmachen jury on the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1778,2022-10-11 09:50:27

We're doing and hopefully completing soon the due diligence and finding a solution And so we are in a position to help consolidate the space I think that speaks volumes in and on itself about how the business was Developed managed to this day and this is the ultimate test the reality of running a business real time Well, and just on the subject of deals you are doing nexo but a minority stake in the US federal bank some national bank last month Why do that deal? What does that do for nexo? Well, we are future proofing nexo this means that right now there is a bit of a turf war between regulators This is going to be under the SEC is it the CFTC? Where does the OCC fitting to that? So it is a little bit messy. It's getting clearer But you know there have been some conversations about what goes where so this is nexo's approach We work on several different Front so regardless of the outcome we can bring our products and services To the US client in a compliant matter so you know having a stake in a federally charted US bank helps a long way and we can use some of their licensure Infrastructure to provide our services Anthony, thanks so much for joining us.

For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful long-lasting and affordable But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid we also need to be able to store energy and release it later To cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity And it's imperative that we figure out the solution here How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change Today's CFOs are reshaping the seasweet positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer like Mary As Lenielberg one of the most important things is looking around the corner Adrian",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1779,2022-10-11 09:54:27

We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store and Lucas Iramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are known. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg surveillance early edition. I'm Kaylee Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now let's take a quick look at what is coming up for the rest of the day. Ukraine will halt exports of electricity from today after Russian strikes hit power facilities. Facebook parent meta also will be holding a conference on augmented and virtual reality. We'll have an interview here on Bloomberg television with Cleveland fed president Loretta Mester at 6.30 p.m. New York time. And the IMF releases its latest world economic outlook as the lender and the world bank called annual meetings in Washington and Anna, we know they have much to discuss. Yeah, absolutely much to discuss. As central bankers congregate at the IMF conference this week, we hear increasing calls for coordinated interventions. So we can the US dollar. Those calls, of course, from outside the United States in the main. Now, Bloomberg's Valerie Tytel is here to take us through why in her view blaming the dollar for its strength and blaming it on the fed. Maybe it misses the point Valerie. Thanks Anna. Now, I want to draw attention to some very large structural shifts that are happening in a few of the world's massive economies. I've got the terms of trade here for the UK Japan and the euro zone. Now, as the energy crisis has escalated, the terms of trade has deteriorated for these economies. That's mostly because they're importing a prohibitively expensive energy. Now, you cannot deny that running these deficits, having this deterioration in the terms of trade, inherently weakens your currency. And in effect, by running these deficits to bring the capital back into a country, you need higher yields. So you need to entice these people to, or entice investors to fund your deficits via a weaker currency and higher yields. Now, the UK and the euro zone specifically are attacking the energy crisis via huge fiscal spending. What does that do that keeps internal demand really high, that keeps your demand for this expensive energy really high? And it will exacerbate these deficits. Now, you can't just put the dollar strength all on the US because you have to realize that the actions by the UK, the actions by the euro zone, especially Germany with their big fiscal spending packages, are pushing this narrative and pushing their currencies weaker. Yeah. Okay. And so that's sort of fundamental reason as to why we see weakness in other currencies, as well as the sort of the move into the safe haven of the dollar map, which is something we've seen as a very regular phenomenon during times of stress. Yeah, exactly. I think Valerie made some really good points and especially the German fiscal spending package has caused concern across Europe, right? They're spending 200 billion euros. Other countries either can't come up with that or can't borrow it as cheaply or aren't willing to do it. And that's why they're starting to talk about shared borrowing now, shared debt. Yeah, absolutely. Thanks to Valerie's title for bringing us that chart. That is it for early edition. More surveillance still ahead. They know that we'll bring you a focus on some of those IMF voices that we're hearing from this week. They'll also speak to Mohammed there again who writes for Bloomberg opinion of course and advises Ali Ashtas. This is Blinkback.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1780,2022-10-11 09:58:57
13555," __ Look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists, because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue, that's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Today on Bloomberg. The hard landing is very likely because the labor market has gotten too tight. This is an environment where the ball market vigilance is a back. You're seeing spread statewide and stays sticky. The Fed is with the jobs report is really indicating that they'll probably continue on hiking and a more aggressive fashion. I think there's a way to come for the market unfortunately. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City for our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg surveillance. I'm Jonathan Farrow together this morning with Greg Peters of PGM. Lisa Abram is coming up a little bit later with some special guests including Apollo's Jim Zalta, looking forward to that. Future's right now down about 1% on ESMP 500. Greg, perfect timing because we've got a lot to talk about in this bond market. The Bank of England busy the last couple of days. What do you make of what we've seen this morning? Well, I see the Bank of England continuing to have their back against the wall. They have no choice in the manner. They're trying to deal with this political situation that's reverberating across the system. LDI is the new acronym Dijor. And so I just think they're stuck and you're setting up for a showdown. I think that's the story. You're setting up for a showdown as you basically have the program ending QT beginning and the budget being due on the same day. What does you say? Right after a date. We've got a date for the showdown. Haven't we? I'll tell you before teeth is the first date. Greg's going to be with us through the hour on a lot of this. Greg, this is what they said in this statement. The bank plans to end these operations and cease all guilt purchases on Friday the 14th of October. Do you expect to wake up Monday morning and see this continue? You know, anytime you draw a line in the sand, that's generally a bad idea.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1781,2022-10-11 10:03:25
13556," the Voktaupa. Do you expect to wake up Monday morning and see this continue? You know, anytime you draw a line in the sand, that's generally a bad idea, right? It's the marginal line I think they're drawing and so I really worry about that as the markets will test them and I think most investors believe that this is a program that has to continue whether they state otherwise or not. Some tension in this bond market, equity futures as I say down about one four percentage point I'll wait for the price action for you briefly the treasury market, the cash treasury market reopening in America with yield tire, equity's down yielded up. How many times have we talked about that? Equities down one percent and it was a little something like this on a 10 year treasury on a 10 year right now on my screen, yield tire by seven basis points up to about 395 11 on a US 10 year in the effects market Euro Dollar unchanged at 96 99. Call it 97, crude down by about 2.6% 88 dollars and about 74 cents. Greg, I've got to pick up on the move in Euro Dollar. We're not going anywhere this morning but there's two points attention in the global bond market once the guilt market the other's Italy yesterday briefly through 250 Italy over Germany and we put out this story about possibly a mutualization of debt the effort to offset some of the pain on the energy front. Can you tell me how much tension you're seeing plant in the European bond market? Not a tremendous amount as of yet. I mean that is the tension point that that story that was kind of about yesterday the Germans tried to you know dismiss that at the same time through some cold water on that Jonathan I'm sorry to say but ultimately it just shows that with higher rates fiscal issues the ECB has the same challenges as the BOE and they have to keep together they have to keep funding liquid across all the different jurisdictions across Europe. You know the acronym in the UK we can talk about the acronym in Europe TPI transmission protection instrument not activated right now do you expect that to be activated pretty soon? I think once again you draw a line in the sand the markets will test it and so I think as we enter the cold winter months I think that pressure will likely ramp up and you'll see you'll you'll see that get activated one way shape reform details matter and so we're all wondering what that means Jonathan and so once again the markets will test it as they always do. George Concovers joining us now the head of US macro strategy MU FG George I'd love your thoughts on the UK first of all I think one conversation we've all had over the last few weeks is how unique these problems are to the UK the potential for spillover from the UK to the global bond market. Can you walk us through George those two particular standpoints? Thank you Morning John yes definitely the bond vigilantes have shown up first in the UK market but with it they kind of dragged up all global rates I think that's the big issue here that we've had years for you know this QE policy globally set and anchored rates globally you know US markets benefited from the back end of it and now you know we're clearly going to see what happens to UK I think you know for the US if it has a similar problem too but we've had two attempts in the last you know three four months of trying to call the pivot the pivot team has zero and the and the roaring bears are two right now I think that the bears are going to win at least for the last couple of weeks. George in Japan this morning we put out the headline about 40 minutes ago the 10-year bond in Japan hasn't traded for three days for the first time since 1999 George can you even call some of these bond markets markets. Like definitely need to open up and get more liquidity that's for sure and I do think that you know that's just going to another example of just how you know when you get so involved into trying in your markets it's hard to kind of pull yourself out. Hey George it's Greg good to see you. How do you see the correlations playing out or their near term so one of the challenges that we have in the bond market is that it's a bond market of one so you know before this all kind of started you'd have you know allocations in one market versus the other today it seemed like one how do you see that playing out or the near term and do you see that breaking. I think at some point it does break but I think the fed is leaving the charge but although I think you know we've seen a global rise in short rates at some point there's going to be a kind of a splitting off between the central banks around the world and the fed probably keeps going forward and you know the BUE and the ECB is going to have to kind of zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1782,2022-10-11 10:07:45
13557," rates at some point there's going to be a kind of a splitting off between the central banks around the world and the Fed probably keeps going forward and you know the BoE and the ECB is going to have to kind of run out of fuel and they can't really keep going further. So I think the correlations will probably shift further to the back end, you know, the 10-year sector plus where you have real risk of big bear steepings over the course of the, you know, the fourth quarter. And then how do you see the ECB being challenged over the winter? Johnston and I were talking about it right before you got on. Do you see that being a real part of the risk factor heading into the winter? Well, look, if there's any central bank that can actually turn, maybe not dovish but could probably pivot sooner is the ECB because they're going to have the challenge between, you know, really thinking about growth versus inflation and that fight. And considering that, you know, growth is really going to decelerate. It has been decelerating in Europe. I think the ECB would be the one to kind of take a pause first. Doesn't mean that they're done tightening, but it could be like a two-stage tightening cycle where they have to get through the winter and then pick up the pieces in the spring. We've all got to talk about trade-offs then. Vice Chair Brainerd came out yesterday with a long speech. I read for us so you don't have to, George. I'm sure you did anyway. This is what Brainerd had to say. Greg, I'd love you thoughts on this as well. In this environment, a sharp decrease in risk sentiment or other risk event that may be difficult to anticipate could be amplified, especially given fragile liquidity and core financial markets. In some countries, she went on to say the realization of these risks could pose challenging trade-offs but policy. What are the policy trade-offs if you're doing this right now? Is this a decision between getting inflation down and maintaining financial stability? Is it one or the other can you do both at the same time, Greg? I think it's really hard to do both. And I think what the market has missed throughout the course of this year is that the Fed and Central Blanks globally are fighting inflation. This is very different than what we've seen over the past many decades. And I think financial stability has also been kind of thrown in for code of the Fed put another type of thing. So like functioning markets is what matters to central bankers. Not that prices are lower necessarily, right? And so I think this is just another kind of spin on traders and investors hoping to get bailed out by Central Banks. Reminds me of 2018 then. What was the difference between now and 2018? Because last time they backed off and said it was about functioning markets, the markets weren't functioning. What's the difference between now and what happened in late 2018? I don't know. That's a good question. I mean, Seoul Blur 2018 sounds like three lifetimes ago. Three decades ago. But I think 2020 is a better example actually, March of 2020. The reason why the Fed stepped in initially was because the markets were completely broken. So you could not trade US Treasuries. And we're not quite there yet. So liquidity isn't pinned in the treasury market absolutely. We just talked about JGB's. So not trading for two straight days. That seems to be common practice there now. So I think central banks are focused on function, not pricing. George, do we have a market function in Gisheu that this Fed needs to respond to anytime soon? Look, in the US markets, they're still functioning, but liquidity is kind of dear and incising of trades or probably keeping scale down. We're also heading into the end of the year. And after such a tough year that we've had and you would expect people to pair down risk anyway, and balance sheets are scarce. So I think we are at the toughest spot in the year. So if the liquidity risks were to get worse here, I think yes, that couldn't it wouldn't matter. But at the end of the day, which markets is the Fed really care about? It's really the bottom market. It's the foundation of everything, the repo markets and the Fed has a lot of tools to put in place since both the COVID crisis and financial crisis. So I think they did probably let the first lines of defense hold and see how that would work before they would actually pivot anytime soon. One last question for you both on this and George, first of you, is the 10-year of buy again every time we get close to 4%. We got to that level then back to way. We're kind of getting close to that level again up seven basis points today and back to 395. Look, I mean, I think we're at this tough spot. I mean, I'm a more concerned about equities than I am about bonds at this point. I think that bonds could benefit from one last like the quality type move. I don't think it, you know, it kind of prevents the Fed. But if we have a, you know, another kind of equity move down 5, 10% and then in the coming weeks, and bonds will rally on that. And then the question is like, does the Fed blink? I don't think they will. Hey, George. Thank you, sir. As always, George, George Concovers there of MUFG. Greg, your thoughts on that? A buy leaning a little bit into the 10-year, into the 30-year space? Well, so I think we're closer to the end in the beginning, the state diavis. Yeah. And so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1783,2022-10-11 10:12:17
13558," Well, so I think we're closer to the end in the beginning, the state diavis. Yeah. And so about 4% and where real rates are does present value. Will you be able to time it absolutely not? I think you need to see the crushing of the front end. I think you need to see rhetoric change, all these types of things, but you are getting close to it. And so I see a lot more value, let's say in the US Treasury market than I do in some of the credit markets. And more needs like this morning with the screens we've got in front of us right now, your Bloomberg, my Bloomberg, what are you doing on a morning like this morning, Greg? Well, so early, Jonathan, I'm still watching it, but no, I mean, you have to take a longer term view in this market. I think trading this market is incredibly difficult. So yeah, you modulate here and there, but you have to have a North Star view. And our North Star view is that there is value, but we're not getting kind of chopped up and just brought in. So I think you have to be disciplined. You can't just kind of wash the screens as it just makes you mad. 39531, watching the screens and getting mad this morning, you're tired by seven basis points. Greg Peele is a PGM sticking with us through the hour. In the next hour, we'll catch up with Gargichowdry of Black Rock. We'll also be catching up with Muhammad Alierean, who will be with us through the seven o'clock hour to break down some of these issues. And just a moment, we're here from Maria today over in Brussels on the potential of the possibility for maybe a joint deficit effort in Europe and potentially a lot more cold water to come from the Germans from New York City this morning. Good morning. Equity futures are lower by about one four percentage point. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Group of seven leaders are scheduled to date, a hold a call during which Russia strikes on civilian targets are set to top the agenda. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said the fresh assault was a retaliation for explosions on a multi-billion dollar bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for that incident. We traded near the highest level in more than three months. As Russian president Vladimir Putin threatened more missile strikes across Ukraine, the escalation has sparked more fears that harbours and transport in the country will be cut even further. The agreement over the Black Sea export corridor comes up for renewal next month. The heads of the IMF and World Bank are warning of rising risk of global recession. IMF managing director Kristalina Giorgiva says higher interest rates are adding to debt pressures on developing nations. She says about a third of the world economy will enter recession this year or next. And Bloomberg has learned the UK is pushing ahead with plans to set a cap on the revenues of renewable power producers. The government officials held talks with energy companies on a mechanism similar to the one proposed in the EU. The move would limit revenues and channel the funds to help struggling consumers. And more allegations in the Elon Musk and Twitter battle. Bloomberg has learned that just before the billionaire revived his proposal to buy the social media company, he accused Twitter of ordering a whistleblower to destroy evidence. According to court filings, leaders at GoZed he burned 10 handwritten notebooks and deleted 100 computer files at the request of managers as part of a $7.8 million severance package.

13559," What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to cool down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. Carbon innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at curves or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. It could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas doesler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. Take fat, peak hole, fish nest, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a fad that will blame the protein thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation in focus Thursday on Bloomberg. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg, lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean or what does it mean? It means they have are Bloomberg. There's the risk in the real danger of a world recession next year. The advanced economies are slowing in Europe, the debt levels for the developing countries are getting more and more burdensome. The rise in interest rates puts added weight on it and inflation is still a major problem for everyone but especially for the poor. David Malpass there, the World Bank president alongside the IMF managing director, Kristine Nukkegawe in the last 24 hours. Alongside me through this act, great Peter Sopeechen, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Greg, when the IMF and the World Bank start saying get, do you start to get the itch to lean the other way? Yeah, well history definitely tells you that that's the case. It's very concurrent forecasting I think but it just speaks to just how much negativity. This is a recession that's been talked about for the past nine months and the data aren't quite there yet. I think we have another six months before things start to play out potentially. This has been what we call a slow moving train wreck and the IMF and World Bank just getting on board is just testament to that.

So let me move in train wreck over in Italy as well. 10 years in Italy this morning up another 12 basis points back to 474 big round trip in the last 24 hours. Our story in the last day or so that Germany is going to back join EU debt for loans to ease the energy crisis. Got a little bit of pushback from the German government in the last day or so. The last 12 hours. Marietta joins us now. Bloomberg Europe correspondent Adam Russell's Maria. What me through the German response to our story suggesting that they're ready to back jointly you debt for loans to ease the energy situation. Well Jonathan you have one source that doesn't go on the record and says the German government is not aware of this plan. But I think you need to take a step back and see how the German government operates at this stage. This is a three party coalition. Of course, a Bloomberg story mentioned that is all of Shalts to German Chancellor who had well, a change of heart after he met with European leaders last week. What I can tell you is that for a week something has been cooking in the behind the scenes across Europe. There was a lot of pushback to the initial 200 billion euro stimulus plan the Germany put out. In the Euro group you could hear a number of countries very openly saying we will need some type of joint response. Otherwise this is going to be itch nation to their own devices. And therefore there's going to be a problem when it comes to the fiscal capacity. And then when the German Chancellor met with European leaders last week, well he heard the same message. There was also a lot of criticism. The Germany did not coordinate well. The Germany did not have a lot of communication. What I would say though is that we're a stage where this is an open debate where there's an actual behind the scenes tension in terms of how to respond to the energy crisis and do it jointly. This is not going to go away. And if you ask me the choreography from now on will be listened to energy ministers today, wait for the European Commission to put something on paper. And then this time next week European leaders will have to decide on something. Whether this is joint debt, whether it's a price cap, I think that remains to be seen. But there is a debate. Well let's talk about the approach to that debate. Is it over loans or grants? Now this way have to make very clear because we've never talked about a recovery fund. If you go back in time and again you have to allow me 30 seconds, a very technical talk here. But if you go back to 2020, this was the recovery fund. It was the wild moment for the European Union. They went jointly triple a rated debt to the market and then distributed that in grants and loans. What we're talking about here is a plan that came before the recovery fund that was known as the shore. But everyone forgot about it because it was eclipsed by the big fund. Now the idea here is that as the EU, you go to the market, triple a rated, you lock better funding costs. And then you get that two member states, but they will have to pay it back. The only difference is that if you're in Italy, you probably want to do it at that rate and not have to do it independently on the market because you're not going to be able to lock such an advantageous rate. That is where the debate is at. Nobody's talking about a recovery fund. 2.0, we have to be very precise about this. Maria, I want to put a catch up with you. Maria, today I'm at a Brussels on the lightest effort. Greatest that can it done for you. Is that enough to put a lid on things over in Italy if this gets finalized? It helps, absolutely helps. It definitely delays a major fear that the markets have where the ECP will lose control and the ability of these peripheral countries to fund themselves at a time where they need the funding. So I think this absolutely helps. And the closer you get Europe together as a fiscal union, the better off we are. How do you compare what's happening now to say 10 years ago when the epicenter, the catalyst for the crisis was on the periphery. And now arguably the epicenter of this is in Germany. Great, that's quite a change. It is a change. And I think it matters and we can kind of think cynically about it, of course. But what it is a process that I think pulls the core to the periphery and so the other way around. And maybe just perhaps Germany seeing the value of having a more fiscal union and aligned European Union. Does that present opportunity in Europe in a way that perhaps there wasn't an opportunity before we got the whatever it takes a moment with Draghi? I think so. I think so. I mean, if you go back, Europe was trading as a single marketplace that obviously blew apart.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1786,2022-10-11 10:25:17
13561," I went with Draghi. I think so. I think so. If you go back, Europe was trading as a single marketplace. That obviously blew apart. And it continues to be quite fractured. But I think it takes less pressure off, just called Italy, and puts more pressure on Germany. And all I'll see, well, that's not such a bad thing. So it's 475, a good thing on a 10-year for you and a team. Is that something you'd buy? For Germany? For Italy. For Italy right now. Once again, I think it's too early, right? The challenge that I think investors have is the extreme volatility. And so we're focused on GILTS, of course, right? Sure. When it swung 100 basis points in a day. But it's happening all over. And so it's hard to really put a stake in the ground. So the vol is so extreme, I think it keeps capital out. So you need to dampen the vol, which is what I think these programs do, and Central Bank try to do, and then investors start to enter the fight. I've been so surprised by how ambitious the ECB has been in the last couple of months. We're having another conversation about a 75 basis point. High, congrats. If I go back to the conversations we'd have in the pandemic, I think if you'd asked me, I was pretty open about it at the time. I was seriously sitting there thinking we could go another full cycle without a rate hike from the ECB. I wasn't alone. Other people were saying the same thing. And here we are talking about 75 again at the end of this month. Do you think that's doable without causing some real issues? I think it is. And I think the ECB has been allowed to get out of the trap. So look at what's going on in Japan. So the BOJ is stuck. And they're stuck as far as the eye can see. And I think that has clear implications. So I think the ECB is using this as an opportunity to normalize rates. As I think history will shine a very unfragrable light on negative rates. And I think they're trying to get as much room as they can. When things do slow, they can cut again. Are we leaving behind this era? There are some people who believe we're just going to return to it in a couple of years time. Do you think we are firmly leaving behind this era? I think so. I think so. I think we're moving out of this central bank dominant phase. Like I said, I think history is going to look back on that and go, God, that's a really bad idea. You're destroying servers, you're destroying insurance companies. Look at the fallout on the LDI side, right? That's just an artifact of the change in policy and how difficult they had it over the past number of years. Let's hope we can get to a better destination. It's certainly painful making the transition right now. Andrew Holland-Hauser City is going to be joining us shortly.

W best possible to consumers a month through four months for distributed contribute based on I think the most important point in that speech was average inflation. It's not 2% it's average and so I think that gives you more room and so I don't think they're going to be completely dumb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1788,2022-10-11 10:35:15
13563," Most important point in that speech was average inflation. It's not 2% it's average. And so I think that gives you more room. And so I don't think they're going to be completely dogmatic to get to 2%. It has to be 2% ish. So maybe a two handle. But the average thing is what really I picked up on. They've done a lot in six months. And Vice Chair Brian did in a speech yesterday reflected on some of that. The three-entry basis points are tightening at six months. And she went through a list of things. The two year through 4% for the first time since 2007. The 10 year near the highest levels at a decade mortgage rates have doubled this year. They reflected on what's happened with the dollar. The Fed's broad dollar index appreciated 11%. They believe it's a lot of tightening in the pipeline. Greg, I just wanted to the risk that they've already overdone it. Do you think the risk of risk they've already overdone it? I think so. I mean, the Fed believes that it's a financially driven economy. So there's a much more immediate impact on rate hikes and what they've experienced in the past. And so time will tell whether that's true or not. But they've done a lot already. You're starting to see fractures in the mortgage market and the housing market. And so my suspicion is that they want to get another 100 in, let's call it, just for good measure. And then they'll reset and see where things shake out. City thinks there's 75 of that coming up the next mating Andrew Haldon host of City Joint Just Right Now, the Chief US Economist. And you let's start there. Why another 75 for you in the next month? So I think it really goes back to what you were just discussing that the Fed has two issues here. One is an economic fundamentals issue. And there that's right, there's been a lot of progress in terms of tightening financial conditions, probably further to go. A lot of that's already priced in. But then they also separately have a communication issue. And I think that's what they're managing. And that's what you see in some of those comments from Evans and from Brainard, where yes, of course, this interest rates get higher and you get into a range that may be more restrictive. You start thinking about should you slow down? Should you pause? The issue is from a communications perspective, how do you explain to markets in the public that you still have resolve in fighting inflation if you're slowing down rate hikes or you're pausing rate hikes? And it ultimately goes back to the data as the data going to give the Fed flexibility to do that. Well, we see CPI slowing down, we see a job market that's loosening. So I think that's what they're really watching now. Are we seeing any of those things or the two things that you mentioned? I think you can argue in labor markets. We maybe saw the first sign of some loosening and you heard Vice Chair Brainard talk about this yesterday, where we had job openings come off meaningfully. So we had a ratio of about two job openings to every one unemployed individual. Historically normal ratio would be maybe one, 1.1. That came down now to 1.7 openings to every one unemployed individual. So it's moving in the right direction for the Fed if they want to see some of that excess demand coming off. However, the level 1.7 openings to every one unemployed individual, I mean, just intuitively, that's a lot of excess demand for labor that's still out there. And Andrew, we have a big release this week, CPI. Is there a level that you think shakes markets confidence one way or the other? So consensus I think is 8.1 annualized. Is there one number or do we need several numbers of a certain trend to really kind of move Fed rhetoric? Yeah, hi, Greg. I think it really is going to come down to where does that core monthly inflation number come in? That's what we saw last month where it was a stronger core reading and Brainard talked about this yesterday. Core goods in particular stayed strong. There's a pretty broad consensus that core goods prices should be coming off until recently, at least we had commodity prices that were moving lower, used car prices that looked like they should move lower. We've seen that in the wholesale prices. So we're really watching that core goods component in the release to see if that slows down. Right now we look at that core CPI inflation month on month. We have that at city at 0.5% month on month, consensus around 0.4% month on month. If you saw that slowed down to a 0.2 or even a 0.3, that would be a signal to markets that maybe you're getting some easing and price pressure. I think though the risks are actually still to the upside that maybe we'll see that 0.4, even 0.5, like we're projecting. Andrew picks up on that quote as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1789,2022-10-11 10:38:19
13564," I'm easing in price pressure. I think though the risks are actually still to the upside that you maybe we'll see that 0.4 even 0.5 like we're projecting. Andrew, I picked up on that quote as well from Vice Chair Brainer. She said there was ample room for margin reconpression to help reduce goods inflation as demand calls, supply constraints, ease and inventories increase. Andrew, tell me the part of inflation is actually going to be stickier and then Greg and I can have a conversation about what that means for corporate profits. So I would take this back to the labour market. I think like I was saying, there are reasons to think that core goods inflation might slow down a bit. If I look at services, labour intensive services and then I go back to that job market where we have 1.7 job openings for every one unemployed individual. We have wage growth according to the Atlanta Fed wage tracker that's still running upwards of 6.7% year on year. Average hourly earnings a little bit slower but still well above levels that would be consistent with 2% inflation. That's where I really worry about persistent inflationary pressure. You'll have some pressure in rents also in shelter prices. That's basically lagged effects from price increases that we've seen in the past but in the past but really non shelter services and the tight labour market is where I would be most concerned about persistent inflationary pressure. Greg, we often talk about the S&P 500 and whether the Federal Reserve has a price target. I wonder if they've got an EPS target because right now you've got the Vice Chair, Tannigas, that there's ample room for margin reconpression. Isn't that basically the Fed telling you the earnings in corporate America are going to come down? Yes, but she's not wrong either because you're looking at record profit margins. Right? Well above anything we've seen on a long-term trend basis and so there is ample room. Right? And so our expectation is profit margins to come down. I've been saying that for over a decade now. But from labour costs increases, just input costs generally under rise and revenues slay to come down. And keep in mind Jonathan that corporates have put on all this low cost debt. That's a good news bad news story. The good news is when the operating leverage is working in your favor, you have ample profits and when that reverses it goes the other way. So I think there's more of a downside deceleration or acceleration to the downside than anticipated. Andrew, just final question from me to you. This 75 basis point hike in November. Is that the last one of the cycle? It may be. It may be and that's where it comes back to. Does the Fed get that flexibility from the data? I think if you see margin compression, like you were just talking about, if you see goods inflation that's slowing, if we see a job market that looks like it's showing some signs of loosening, that would give the Fed the at least the signs that it needs to see to start that process of slowing down. If you don't see those things and I think that's the risk, we could get another 75 basis point. So it's a quick meeting. I'm sure the market will price a pivot somewhere in between at some point in our future. Andrew, thank you. Andrew Holenhorst over at City looking for 75 from the Fed next month. That decision will come a week before the midterms. I am H down in DC. Join us right now. Amory, talk to us about a month ahead. Well, we just had some insight last night, Jonathan, about the Senate race in Ohio. This is Senator Portman's seat and very much this is Ohio. That's turned red over the past two elections, the voting for Donald Trump twice. But if you look at what 538 is saying, they're saying that this race is actually getting very, very close. And you had this debate with JD Vance and then Congressman Tim Ryan. And Jonathan, the top issues we've seen across the polls really came out in this debate. You had Congressman Ryan talking Vance and extremist. A portion was one of those issues. At the same time, you saw the congressmen actually say distancing himself from the White House, saying that President Biden shouldn't run again, said that the vice president was wrong about saying that the southern border was secure. So you see these issues coming up again in a very hotly contested race. That's Ohio. And you're going to see more of these debates to give you an insight of what's going on within the country. I would also like to point to what's going on in Nevada because there's an issue that is affecting the White House right now. And that's obviously the concern of rising oil prices and what that means for gas prices. And what you see is that potentially Republicans can flip Nevada.

The city of strategist, Amazou O'Maricus, line from New York City this morning. Here's the state of play. I'm sure the equity market bulls would love the bond market just to stay closed, but that's not how this works. It was up again by six basis points, the 394, 49, you know, we get the equity market is going. The yields up, stocks down, equities down by eight, tens of 1%, crude down a little bit, down by 2.4% to 88, 94. The theme of the last couple of weeks down the commodity market, we've got a bounce, a rally once again, Conor Hatch joins us now, the head of research at ED and F-Mant. Let's start there. I think a lot of people wanted to park this story as something that happened a year ago, and it's going to start to fade a little bit more. It's back on the agenda. Why? Why did it start fading? I think that was because the mood of the sentiment, basically moved away from, in face new fears, which is very pro commodities, to recessionary fears, which are anti commodities. And so I think you started to see a wholesale risk off. The dollar was strong, nobody would invest in commodities. And then last week or so, we started to see partly a retraction in the dollar, but importantly, we started seeing escalation in the Ukrainian war. And I think what that has done is brought back to attention, the fact that this part of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1792,2022-10-11 10:51:03
13567," a retraction in the dollar, but importantly, we saw this in escalation in the Ukrainian war. And I think what that has done is brought back to attention the fact that this powerhouse, which is a Ukraine and Russia, they are such a big supplier of food and energy commodities that anything can go wrong overnight. And I think they just realized that actually stocks are not that comfortable across the commodity space. And if you see further supply disruptions from this region, suddenly the supply demand balances can go out right. And this is when things become a little bit scary again. Econor, is this sentiment or something more real? Is there something that you saw take place over the weekend that will actually disrupt supply? Well, the way the missiles were targeted, it did seem to be that Russia was targeting some of the energy, energy facilities of Ukraine. I think that is a strategic issue and I think it's worrying because obviously if you Ukrainian people then have to flee the country and move to Europe in order to seek energy, they'll be correct. Essentially, energy refugees will be saw in Europe the last year or so. We've been seeing a huge influx of Ukrainian refugees which have pushed up demand for food. Now we might see the same thing for energy at a time when European energy is really there's just not enough to go around. So I think that is a key issue and I think we just know that Europe is so vulnerable right now to any kind of supply disruption out of Russia and Ukraine is just another one of the top now. Econor, based on what you're seeing right now and I'd love to wrap things up with the following question. Do you see a material risk that these kind of price moves might be sticky than some people think even in a desalurating economy? Yes, unfortunately yes because although we do have a recession, we fear as a head and that in itself can lead to demand destruction not just for energy but also for certain foods, particularly food in the price and elastic ones. I think ultimately commodities are staples you can't do without them and I think certainly the supply side risks are just too intense right now, particularly as we go into the winter period. I think it's just entrenched in everything whether it's food production or manufacturing or transportation, everything is underlying by how's high the energy price are going to go. So I think inevitably that means it's sticky. You're not going to see prices normalize back to where we were over a year ago. I think that is not going to happen and certainly as long as the supply side risks are elevated as they seem to be now, I think that is definitely a deficit. Thank you, always going to catch up, kind of have a ID and F-man on the latest in the commodity markets and fun of thoughts now with great pages of PG and great first of all thanks for being with us for an hour. Thanks for having me. CPI Thursday, how sticky is this story going to be? We've talked about peak Fed and we've had to park that once again, talked about peak inflation, had to park that about five different times in the last 12 months or so. Are we going to make the same mistake again? I think inflation is incredibly difficult to forecast to say the obvious. And so I wouldn't be surprised by another misreading, but I think ultimately what we're seeing month after month is a broadening out and the stickiness that we didn't anticipate. And I also think it's important to look at it globally. So this is not just a US issue, this is a global issue and there's different reasons that's driving it. So I believe that inflation is a little more stickier than what's being forecasted. The forward market is still really quite enthusiastic around inflation coming down. And I think the story, Jonathan, over the next six to nine months is the stickiness of that inflation reading. Even if it does come off the peak, is it really going to be a straight line down to 2% so? So we could have full 5% inflation and a recession. That would be a really bad outcome if you're a central banker and that's the risk on the table. And so if that's the case, I think central bankers have to lean on it even harder, right? If you throw the economy into a recession and inflation remains high, you fail on both fronts. So to me, that means you don't pause, you actually lean harder into it. How does the bond market try in that world? Poorly. I mean, the worst case scenario for the bond market is that inflation often ends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1793,2022-10-11 10:55:32
13568," As you actually lean harder into it, how does the bond market try to pull out? Poorly. I mean, the worst case scenario for the bond market is stagflation, off financial assets, right? And that's what we're witnessing this year. And so if that's still pervasive into next year, then I think you'll have much of the same story next year as you do this year. We've gone through a range of markets this morning together on your screen on mind. And you've talked a lot about whether opportunities might be, but each and every time you've said not yet, it needs to be patient here. What are you waiting for? What specifically are you waiting for? What are the preconditions that you and the team get around the table and think about? And we're just not there yet. What are you waiting for? Yeah, I mean, look, I am much more enthusiastic around the opportunity set today than I was six months ago, nine months ago, right? If you go back to when the tenure was at 50 basis points, where was the opportunity going forward? Right? It was well, sure, obviously, but, but, you know, we're definitely seeing a lot of value created. We're seeing lots of disruption. And so we are excited about micro parts of the market. So if you look at what's happening with the LDI situation, there's lots of interesting securities for sale at distressed types of prices. Those are the things we're focused on. These broad macro calls just are really difficult. Normally, they're even more difficult today. So we're seeing lots of value idiosyncratically. You know, we are bond pickers at the end of the day, but I think making a massive call on rates and overall kind of beta market is really difficult. You're not going to force you to make a massive call on rates right now. If I buy the 10 year here, am I happy I did in 12 months? Maybe not 12, but 18 to two years. Absolutely. Great paydust of PGM.

Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September.

13569," By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage Manager and iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about Stage Manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. How to Defeat the iPhone 16?

This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio. Alongside, Mohamed Allerin, for the next hour, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Equity futures dad, 710, of 1%. Mohamed, this is special. The vigilantes are back in the bond market and the central banks are got some problems, haven't they? They have. Not only are they needing to balance growth and inflation, but there's financial stability on top. It's a three-dimensional challenge that is actually very tricky. Do you think they're going to have to tolerate higher inflation? This will be a thing we talk about through the next 60 minutes, but is that ultimately where this is heading? Ultimately, ultimately, ultimately. Three ultimately, yes, that's where it's heading, but on the way there, they're going to stick to that 2%. You talked about that better destination a few times over the last couple of weeks. What is that destination? First, we exit artificial finance, which has created a lot of damage. And which we are going to spend a lot of time trying to overcome. That's really important. We need genuine finance as opposed to artificial finance. And secondly, we're going to focus more than ever on economic growth and economic growth that's sustainable. That's a better place to be than where we've been. We'll discuss this with Kankachadri if BlackRock, imminently. Going into that conversation, equity futures look like this on ESMP, with down 6.10% of 1%. This positive correlation between bonds and stocks is not going anywhere. Equity's down treasuries down yield tire by 5% to 5%. The 3.92, 86 on a 10 year, equity's lower by 6.10% of 1%. Eurodollar, Euro show an a bit of strength here at 97.19%, positive 2.10% of 1% and crude a little bit of weakness at $88.96. We're missing Bramow today. She's over at the Greenwich Economic Forum and Lisa joined us right now, morning, Lisa. Hey, John. And I will just say I couldn't have hand all the bearishness. So I just decided to take a cruise down the Long Island Sound and contemplate this new regime change and perhaps also the Mets, which I'm not going to be in studio to speak with the Muhammadal area and sob together about what's going on. We are going to be having some incredible conversations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1795,2022-10-11 11:04:11
13570," to play this new regime change and perhaps also the Mets, which I'm not going to be in studio to speak with the Muhammadal area and sobbed together about what's going on. We are going to be having some incredible conversations today. You know, we have policymakers meeting in Washington, D.C. to talk about how they are featuring higher inflation, how they're combating that in the face of slowing growth. Here it's what do you do as an investor? Who is the marginal buyer? We're going to be speaking with Jim Zeltor of Apollo. We're also going to be speaking with Lawrence Gullub of Gullub Capital, Ned Lamont, the Connecticut governor coming up here. And then later on the day, Ray Dallio, of course, of Bridgewater, the co-achief investment officer, Kathy Wood of Arkham Best and Kip Davir of Aries Capital. This question of, at what point is this a buy? At what point are we looking at something that actually offers value? If you're a bond vigilante, are you there yet? Are you happy with what you're seeing? And John, it kind of answers the question of, okay, what's the trigger point where we start to realize this new reality? And people start to say, yay, we're getting yield again. Potentially, maybe. Lisa, thank you. Awesome. And let the record show that Lisa brought up in the Mets, Mohammed, and I didn't. I know, but I'm glad she's not here because I do think we would solve together. You can miss a rate. Oh, totally. We would make each other cry even more. You support the jets, though. She supports the giants. I can live with that. You can live with that. I can live with that. I can live with that. I can live with that. I can live with that. For both teams. For both teams, the giants too. The giants too. The giants too. That came back in a very dry, very dry, very scratchy question. It's the rogers, is that right? Yes. So, let's now look forward to it. Around the table with Mohammed and I, through the next 10 minutes or so, Gargit Chowtry of BlackRock. Gargit, thank you for coming in. Let's talk about market functioning. Have we got a market functioning problem? Good morning to both of you. It's great to be here. So, market functioning problem in the US. We haven't really seen it, especially when we compare it to what's happening in the UK. I will say, you know, given my seat and looking at ETFs and looking at ISHIS trading, we have seen a huge amount of volume in ETF trading. You know, there are days when we get up to about 43% of the equity market trading in ETF. And I think there is something to take away from that and that means that people are looking for liquidity and going where they can find it. So, is there a challenge yet? No. Can there be, especially as we go into your end with the quantitative tightening in process, there could, for sure. And I think the Fed has to be very cognizant of that. Where are you anticipating pockets of stress at the moment? So, at the moment, I would say that, you know, for almost all of the year, you know, the B have thought about interest rates moving up. And only now are we getting to some levels, especially in the longer end of the curve. So, 10, 15, 20, 30s, which may be looking a little bit more interesting to people. So, to the extent that a lot of investors come back into the interest rate market, a lot of investors come back into the long end of the curve. And then we see bond outflows. Then we see foreign investors, Japanese investors sort of flee away from the market because of hedging costs. I think there could be some stress there. I don't actually expect there to be any massive stresses in the front end of the market or even in the credit market because I think the balance sheets of most of these companies look very good. So, staying up in quality makes a lot of sense. And I would also say that, you know, we started talking about liquidity going into your end. I'd be very cautious about how the market trades keep a strong eye on the repo markets. But are we looking in the right places? So, when I hear you say we're not seeing stress in the ETF space. We're not seeing, we're not going to see stress because fundamentals are basically sound for most companies. I agree on both. But that's not where stress originates. Stress sensor originates in the periphery. It then contaminates technicals, technicals then cascades through the market. And next thing you know, even markets with strong fundamentals are disrupted. So, if you look at the periphery, don't you start seeing serious stress developing there? Yeah. And I think that's why when I started this conversation, I was like in the US, you know, it's obviously we're in a much better place. I think when we go out to Europe and we are looking at periphery in Europe, I think that could suddenly be the case. I think there's a lot of doubts about how they're going to come out of this energy crisis and how they're going to do, especially with interest rates climbing higher. So, yes, some stress could occur there. And also say that unfortunately, we're often not able to pinpoint the stress exactly, right? But it isn't going to be the housing market stress that we had in the crisis just because it happened the last...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1796,2022-10-11 11:08:51
13571," Finally, we're often not able to pinpoint the stress exactly, right? This isn't going to be the housing market stress that we had in the crisis just because it happened the last time. I think there will be new areas of stress in the market. I think, you know, one of the things that we'll be looking at is market functioning and how bonds and equities trade between now and the end of the year. And we'll be looking at what it costs to finance things. I think that's what will give us some indication. So the top question I get asked and I want to pass it to you is when we have an inflation concern, when we have a growth concern, and now we have a market potentially, a market function concern, where should we hide? Where do we go? How do you get risk mitigation until portfolio? What do we tell people? Yeah, it's a good question. And it's been a hard year for market participants for investors with bonds not really giving us that ballast. I think the good news or a little bit of a good news is that at least the front end of the curve, the closer and closer we get to that 4.5% in the US markets can potentially be a place to hide. I do think the closer we get with, you know, US to be a Treasury is getting you 4.5% with front end IG, getting you over 5%. I think those are creating some pockets of opportunities. I'll also say that within the equity markets, there are areas that you're supposed to gravitate towards. We've talked about this even since our media in July, where energy markets and energy equities, not so much energy as a commodity, but energy equities given the balance sheet of the companies, given the cash flow, given the earnings that we're going to see. I think is another area that could potentially do well, could be that inflationary hedge for you. And I would also say that infrastructure probably, when we think about inflation hedge infrastructure, given the backdrop of potential policy support that's coming its way, could be another, but broadly would I buy long duration today, not quite yet. But I think the front end of fixed income markets, high quality fixed income markets, are beginning to look attractive. And the last one, and this is my favorite, I've spent my life looking at inflation-linked bonds, but the very front end, and again, looking at two years and shorter, that has cheapened up significantly. Some pressure from UK. I'd say that wouldn't make a little bit of sense. You've got some competition from the Bank of England now, because they could be buying linkers too. Mahavad, you brought something up that I think is really important for many people. It's been super frustrating, massively frustrating. The positive correlation between equities and bonds, is it price that changes that story, that we get to a moment in the treasury market where it just kicks in the other way, or does something about the environment need to change? So John, first we've had that private correlation for a while, but it worked for us. So when both prices were going up, should in here anybody complaining, right? Why? They were both coming up because they were pushed by predictable and massive injection of liquidity. The financial conditions have changed. The liquidity regime has changed. So it's not surprising to me that the positive correlation, the unusually historic positive correlation has persisted. Yes, look, at some point I agree with Gargie, the front end is starting to look attractive, again. But be careful of technicals. You know, a lot of people underestimate what technicals look like. And when you go to a regime where people are forced to do things, then that changes the market in a significant manner. Are we in that regime right now? We're going close. Gargie, are we? It'll, I'm not sure yet. I think we learn more between now and the end of the year, and I think the central bank has a big role to play in that. Do you think this Fed's going to back away anytime soon? Not this year, but I think next year. Yes, I think once they start seeing a couple of prints on CPI, which we haven't even talked about yet, once they see a couple of prints that are away from the 0.5s and 0.6 closer to the 0.3s, and healthcare inflation starts coming down. Perhaps rental inflation starts coming down. I think they can start talking about the two-sided nature. We heard that from Laila Breinard yesterday. I think they can start talking about monetary policy works with a lag. So, let's see. See, in a couple of days, final worth, then, inflation Thursday. 6.5 on core, 8.1 on headline, look for services strength and good weakness. And I would specifically look for services ex of shelter to see how that's accelerating or decelerating. Can I just tell you, 6.5 on core relative to 6.3, which was the last read, where does core peak adhere to?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1797,2022-10-11 11:13:02
13572," X of shelter to see how that's accelerating or decelerating. Can I just say 6.5 on core relative to 6.3, which was the last read? Where does core peak? I think around, I mean, it's always hard to say that, but I think around here, just around here. So maybe we see another month, I think more importantly, we should look at the month over month prints because there's so many funky dynamics, as you know, with the 2021, the 20 prints, but I would say that monthly changes probably allow for this to be kind of the peak. Gargoye, Chartery, with BlackRock. Gargoye, thank you. The title of your latest piece, the romance with the Fed pivot breaks investors' hearts. It's going to break a lot of hearts again, isn't it? That was last week. Let's hope something else sort of we establish another romance. My hamage sticking with us through the next 60 minutes or so will catch up with Michael Arogg, Chief Market Strategist at Jones Trading.

Keeping you up to date with News from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Group of seven leaders are scheduled to hold a call today during which Russia strikes on civilian targets are set to top the agenda. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said the fresh assault was a retaliation for explosions on a multi-billion dollar bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for that incident. We traded near the highest level in more than three months. As Russian president Vladimir Putin threatened more missile strikes across Ukraine. The escalation has sparked more fears that harvests and transport in the country will be cut even further. The agreement over the Black Sea export corridor comes up for renewal next month. Singapore Airlines says pregnant cabin crew workers can keep their jobs.

Responding to a straight Times article on Monday, Singapore Air said pregnant cabin employees may choose to work on ground crews and can resume flying duties after maternity leave. Credit Suisse faces a short fall of as much as $8 billion in 2024. That's according to Goldman Sachs. It's a further illustration of the troubles facing the Swiss lender.

The problems that come to me and my senior leadership team for resolving tend to be highly complex and neilsome. Your ability to solve those complex problems is an important element.

13573," add to the company. And then I think opportunities, you always want to make sure that you've got a creative enough mind and open enough mind to be able to see around square corners. What am I missing? The why questions are really powerful. Why are we not doing this? So why are we doing this? I ask those questions a lot. And in the answers, you can sometimes tease out some real opportunities, some hidden things. But thinking creatively about opportunities and problems is really important. And what about the industry generally? I think they have big challenges now as the defense budget probably comes down a bit. So I think that we are all responsible. And we have an obligation to find the latest and best technologies that we can for our customers and deliver them in the most cost effective manner we can. And I think that that's a challenge and an opportunity for all of the big defense companies. Today's CFOs are reshaping the C-suite, positioning companies to meet the next generation of challenges, breaking out of traditional roles to become chief future officer, like Mary-Aus Linio Berg. One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store. And Lucas Eramela at Mondalees. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. The markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European polls with Guy Johnson in London and Alex Steele in New York. Real-time numbers, real-time analysis. We days. Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. We take fat, peak hawkishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still sticky. US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the polls. This is a Fed that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday.

Life from New York City this morning. Good morning. Alongside Mohammed, our area for the next hour. Looking forward to our coverage. We'll catch up with the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister a little bit later. This hour as well. Futures right now. Shaping up as follows on the S&P 500. We are lower, negative by 6 tenths of 1%. Just about off the lows and guess what? Treasury yields just about off the highs. He yields up by four basis points on a 10 year 392 25. The guilt market, Mohammed in the UK all over the place. File this under things you never want to say as a central banker. This line here, dysfunction in this market and the prospect of self reinforcing fire sale dynamics, pose a material risk to UK financial stability. They've expanded their support this morning. They still have this line and no. As previously announced, the bank plans to end these operations and cease all guilt purchases on Friday the 14th of October. That is a couple of days away. Is that doable? It is doable, but doable in a very challenged environment. What they're trying to do is pass on the liquidity provision to the private market supported by the Bank of England. That's what they're trying to do. John, I think there are two major takeaways here because they go beyond what's happening in the Bank of England. One is the difficulty of balancing growth inflation and financial stability. It is not just the Bank of England issue. You'll see it in the Eurozone, you'll see it in the US. The second issue, which is just as important, is tipping points. Once the bond vigilantes are unleashed, they tend to find tipping points. So central banks and governments have to be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1799,2022-10-11 11:21:39
13574," Once the bond vigilantes are unleashed, they tend to find tipping points. and governments have to be very aware that we are getting closer Again, and tell me which one you think we have to accept? We need the central banks to focus on inflation, we need governments to do more to promote economic growth, and then we need the regulators because the risk of financial stability is in the non-banks. It's not in the banks, it's in the non-banks. We need the financial regulators to step up to a challenge that they haven't done. WISC doesn't disappear, it moves and migrates and it has migrated to the non-banks. Is that an impossible trinity? It's a difficult trinity, it's not an impossible trinity, it's a difficult trinity. And the later you leave it, which is why the Fed being so late is problematic, the later you leave it, the harder it gets. The reason I ask these questions, and I've asked this a Rick Reader last week, I'd love your insight on this too. Think about what we've just blown up, and I don't think we have enough time to reflect on this. Every given morning we talk about the latest news, the latest data point. We've just blown up a decade of QE, negative rates, zero rates forever. We were sitting here thinking maybe we go through another full cycle with ECB doing the same thing. And I'm trying to understand whether we fully realize the consequences of them. We touched on it with Garkey Chowdry and Garkey talks about the resilience of balance sheets. And I hear that a lot about public markets, about credit, corporate balance sheets. I hear that a lot about household balance sheets, not 2008 again. And you correctly brought up where the risks might lie and it's on the periphery. Can you give me a little bit more on that? So first, for the last year you and I have been talking about that sequence that we didn't want to see happen. It starts with interest rate risks. It's all about central banks changing the liquidity regime. Then it migrates to credit risk. We worry about recession. And then if we're not careful, it migrates to liquidity risk. And we've been talking about be careful of that sequence because when we get to liquidity risk, all three are playing at the same time. And what we've seen happen because central banks have been so late, is that that sequence has played out. And we are now dealing with interest rates and credit risk. And we're worried about liquidity risk. That's a really difficult environment. And we have to appreciate that navigating through this is going to be incredibly bumpy. Marcus Ability is the phrase at a moment. Market functioning. And market functioning too. Vladimir Putin of Russia talking about market stability right now. OPEC plus decisions aimed at ensuring market stability goes on to say that OPEC plus decisions were not aimed at anyone else. Amarie joined us now, Dan in Washington. And it makes you take on those lines. Well, we've heard this before from the leaders of OPEC countries. But obviously, even if they're not aimed, as President Putin says towards anyone else, they clearly benefit the producers. Especially the likes of Russia, which at the moment is really being hampered on how much they can export. But obviously needs a much higher price. Jonathan, I would say for Putin to make these comments were relatively bland for him on the energy front, you have to look at who he's sitting next to. Right now, he's having a meeting with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the leader of the UAE. And it's quite uncomfortable for some of these leaders who are trying to act as a mediary and individuals who want to strike a peace deal with this war that's happening with Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This is something Putin can say alongside MBZ to say that this OPEC decision was really about markets to billy and not about politics, which many are viewing it as. And, Amarie, as you've been widely reporting, this has both domestic implications for the U.S. But it also has implications for U.S. foreign policy. So how do you think the Biden administration responds to what it's seeing? It's incredibly challenging for the administration right now on two fronts. One, you have, of course, the geopolitics and the politics and the optics of the president making this historic trip to the kingdom. And then just three months later and weeks before the midterms, the kingdom not coming to its help in terms of oil supply when clearly they need to leave keep a lid on gasoline prices. What John and the nice spoke about in the last hours, the fact that you look at the national average is below $4 a gallon, but you look at places like Nevada where the Democrats are really trying to keep a hold of that Senate seat. And right now the polls are not showing that may not be possible. You have a gallon of gasoline.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1800,2022-10-11 11:25:50
13575," you What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. And all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs.

13576," It ups on the brakes, something goes through the windshield. The cost of financing has gone up, and it will create tension in the system. Mohammed, you've been talking about this for a long, long time. What's coming through the windshield? So the economy is starting to go through the windshield. The financial system is starting to go through the windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. It is the most front-loaded, interest rate cycle that we have seen in a very long time, and it didn't need to be this. This is the tragedy of it, John. It didn't need to be this way. This is a self-inflicted wound by central banks. You're incredibly frustrated with this Fed, and the damage is about to do to this economy. I am not just to this economy, but to the rest of the world. And this, they've been warned over and over and over again, but somehow they held on to this transitory for way too long. Mistake number one and mistake number two, when they retired that word from the vocabulary they didn't act. They didn't act in any meaningful way. 300 basis points now in six months. Vice-Champ Rinerd yesterday went through a long list of things, just to convey how much financial conditions have tightened at two years through 4% for the first time since so 7, 10 year near decade highs on a 10-year-yield, mortgage rates have doubled this year. She talked about the strength of the dollar so far this year as well. Long and variable lags. Can you walk me through long and variable lags? It feels like to me over the last several years we talked about a Fed at a market that just prises in everything all at once. Click on the fingers just like that. Do you push back against that? I do, and I push back also about being overly data dependent because when you're overly data dependent, you don't look beyond the next corner, and then you get surprised by what you meet. I would suggest to everybody to read Leiboranot speech. That was actually a very balanced speech and a very thought-provoking speech. And probably the best thing that's come out of the Fed for a while in terms of where we are and what to think about going forward. She reflected on policy trade-offs in that speech. I was reading it again last night. She was after she delivered it. What do you think the trade-offs are now for this Fed? So it is back to the trilemma that we talked about earlier. It is inflation, growth, and financial stability, and they somehow have to find a way through this. And the spillover, potentially, from the rest of the world is something to consider too. They're going to hear about a lot at the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. We're going to talk about it right now with Jane Foley, the head of FX Strategy at Raba Bank. Jane, let's start with the Bank of England's additional support earlier today. What did you make of that? Well, it does seem a little bit desperate, doesn't it? It does raise the question about what happens at the end of the week if the Bank of England goes ahead and withdraws this support. So we know why the Bank of England have been doing this clearly. There's been fairly chaotic moves in the GILTS market. And again, yesterday, particularly in the index link to market, which is why they had to incorporate that into their special measures. But of course, this is just addressing the symptoms, not the cause and the cause remains that the market is very concerned about what this government is doing on fiscal policy and on spending. And of course, we had those reports today for the Institute of Physical Studies saying, the government may have to make cuts of huge cuts, you know, 60 billion or so in spending in order to balance the books. That is going to be extremely painful. And although the Chancellor's brought forward his statement until Halloween about how he's going to balance these books, it's not clear that we can really be convinced that he can really send a reassuring message on that date. Jenny, won't ask you to guess what will or won't happen on Friday. Have it gets removed or have it gets extended? Can we do a bit of scenario analysis, though? Can you tell me about what you think this market would look like in response to a bank giving that does not extend that GILTS market operation? I think it's going to look pretty horrible if they do not. Like I say, because the fundamental problem remains unaddressed and that's about fiscal spending. So if they don't extend this, if they go ahead and say, yeah, we're going to start up quantitative tightening at the end of the month again. It's going to look like a terrible mess. And I think that's something which will again be reflected in the price of the pound as well. If they extend, well, I think there's a lot of pressure for them to do that. You get to the extent where it might be questioning their credibility. But the bank have been very careful in whose bonds they are buying, they're buying smaller amounts, because they really are trying to pinpoint that the pension funds are under stress, not buying assets back from everybody. So that's protecting their credibility to some degree. But really, I think the ball has got to be in the government's court and the government do need to realize that. Jane, if I may ask you to go from the UK to global.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1802,2022-10-11 11:37:43
13577," I think the ball has got to be in the government's court and the government do need to realise that. Jane, if I may ask you to go from the UK to global, lots of people will be convening on Washington DC for the annual meetings of the IMF in the World Bank. There's a view out there that the dollar strength is a US problem. It is up to the US to do something about it. The US should perhaps intervene of some sort. Is it really that? Well, I think the problem is bigger. I mean, you mentioned before, the global economy going through the windscreen. And I would go even further and say for some economies, they're not only through the windscreen, but they're under the wheels as well on the back of dollar strength. It's clearly providing a huge amount of pain. But the problem is, is that the Fed have got to domestically focused mandate. They're not mandated as things are to look at the wider economy. And I think we've talked about this on Blumberg before, about the dollar almost being in this feedback loop, whereas the worse it becomes for the global economy, the more likely people are just to buy the US dollar, which of course makes it worse again, for some countries in the global economy. So that there does need to be some sort of outlet for this. And I think that's only going to happen when the Fed decides that, yeah, you know what it's done enough to push that inflation gene back in the box, or something gives. But right now, I think it is this terrible pressure on the global economy. And the Fed right now appears to just be really quite resistant to that. So what do you say to people who say it's already given the XY peak at 115, we're down to 112, we're going to be going even lower. This is a problem from yesterday. Dollar strength is behind us. Do you really think dollar peak is behind us? No, no, not necessarily. And I would say, you know, dollar strength is only peaked. You know, when you can answer the question, well, what else are you going to buy? You know, when you want to buy risky assets, when you want to move into emerging markets, when the fundamentals are there for you to take on that risk, that's when dollar, the dollar will appear. And I don't think we are there yet. I think, you know, there's so much bad news coming from the global economy that I don't think there is an appetite to sell dollars and buy those risky currencies just yet. Dollar cash, Mohammed. It's been the only place to be all year, hasn't it? It has. Do you see that improving anytime soon? So I agree with Jane. Jane's absolutely right, but you have to recognize that there's a growing number of people who believe that peak everything is behind us. Peak dollars, behind us, peak yields, behind us. And we've heard it all over again. I don't agree, but that the view is out there. You're going to these IMF meetings a little bit later this week. Do you think we could even come up with a kind of coordination that is required to do something about this even if we wanted to? No, this is not April 2009. Multilateral governance is really challenged. I think we're going to talk about the problems that's going to be socialization that this is a global issue. It's not a UK issue. It's not a USH. It's global. I love the way Jane said that it's not just that people have gone through the windscreen, but certain developing countries are under the wheels, which is absolutely right. And that's going to be expressed very loudly. The problem, as she points out, is it's difficult to do something about. There's one central bank that's sitting this whole thing out, Jane. It's the bank of Japan. I'd love a final word on that. The JGB 10 year didn't trade today for a third straight session for the first time since 1999. We don't even have a market there anymore. And I think we should stop calling it one. Jane, I want to understand from your perspective what this BOJ looks like after Corrota. You know, I would say that right now, the bank of Japan understood that when the Ministry of Finance a few weeks ago, what did that intervention? They understood it was just buying time. The Dullian has been trending higher still since the intervention. They know that that's going to be the case because of the interest rate differentials. But they know as soon as the Ministry of Finance starts talking about verbal intervention, again, they will then be forced to do something about it at some point. So they're waiting, they're watching. But I think Dullian is still biased to go higher as long as the bank of Japan is on its policy course, which of course is one of wanting to nurture inflation. So different from the rest of the G10. Jane Foley of Raba Bank, Katalund and Jane, thank you. Thank you very much. What do you make of that? There's two ways of looking at this. I was perhaps a little bit mean earlier this year and I said the BOJ is like the off-street with the head and the sand, pretending nothing is going on around it when everyone else is high-con interest rates. There is another way of looking at this. It's much kinder. There it is at the BOJ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1803,2022-10-11 11:41:55
13578," A little bit mean earlier this year and I said the BOJ is like the off-street with the head and the sand pretending nothing is going on around it when everyone asks is high-con interest rates. There is another way of looking at this. It's much kinder. It's that the BOJ sees this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reset inflation expectations in Japan. Which one is it? I think it's more the format than the latter. I think they are in a cognitive trap than they're not able to get out of. You know, it is meaningful when you say the government bond market hasn't traded in three days. It's ridiculous. I mean, how unthinkable is that statement? The government bond market. Sure. Which is at the centre of all other markets. Well, you've talked about that transition then. How hard is it to transition away from what we've witnessed in the last couple of decades? Two-way markets. Two-some people coming in a market and trying to price risk again. I go back to the image of a very bumpy journey to a better destination. You've got to navigate both the journey and the destination. Well, let's talk about a bump and I think it's a massive pot hole. What happens if you're a curve control gets abandoned in Japan? Right now, a 10-year-old 25-basis point. Is that a problem for them or a problem for us, the rest of the world? I miss many problems for them. I mean, think because the rest of the world has reprised, it is the outlayer and think of a ball on the water and suddenly you release it, it will overshoot. It's going to go like a rocket. We mentioned the IMF meetings a few times. How gloomy do you think these are going to be? They're going to be gloomy. Because there's also geopolitical risk on top of that. There's the whole challenge on climate. We mustn't forget that. So this is going to be a reminder a little bit of October 2008 when people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. And yet still we're not forecasting recessions at the Fed. Not forecasting a recession at the ECB. You call it aspirational? Do you call it aspirational? We had someone write in on Twitter that said, you want it to say it was delusional, but you're checked yourself. Is it delusional or aspiration? Must be someone that I know. Mahauda-Lerion is sticking with us. We'll continue this conversation on Europe in just a moment.

13580," It was off session high, still higher though, on the day by four basis points, 392.45 on a 10 year Euro dollar, 97.23. How about I can't get used to that? 97.23 on Euro dollar, we're positive about two tenths of 1% lucky this morning, not just because we have Mohammed Al-Aryan around the table with us, but also because we joined by Nadia Calvina, the Deputy Prime Minister of Spain. Madam Vice President, fantastic to have you with us in the building. Thanks for having me. Let's start here. The prospect of joint debt to do something about the energy crisis in Europe. Is that something you think we can find agreement on at the European level? Well, when we were hit by the pandemic, Europe reacted in a very decisive manner, on the basis of unity and solidarity, I think that now this time around that we are faced with global challenges, again, a war at the doorstep of Europe, we should react with the same principles, you know, whether that entails additional debt issuance or not, we will see. But in any case, we should act, you know, together in a decisive manner to tackle these challenges. Based on preliminary discussions with say the Germans, have they conveyed to you that that's something they would support? We were with, actually, we had the bilateral summit between Spain and Germany this last week, and we had an exchange with the ministers also with the Chancellor's Shulz. He was one of the persons that was behind the issues of joint debt to address and to tackle the challenges from the pandemic. We didn't go into the details, but I am quite sure that Germany is aware of the need to react in a manner which makes us stronger and allows us to face the current challenges in the best possible manner for our populations too. You're excellent. See, there is a market consensus developing that this is going to be a very difficult winter for Europe. A winter that may see Europe fall into recession. What's not clear is the length and depth of this potential recession. Do we have any indicators of what happens if indeed Europe falls into recession this winter? I think what will happen will depend on what we do. That is something I think we have learned in the last three years. So I am not really deterministic in the sense of this is what's going to happen. We need to now take the right decisions to avoid this situation arising. We're meeting this work in the World Bank and IMF annual meetings. This is a very challenging, delicate point in time. Global economy is slowing down. Inflation is increasing in some Western economies. But I hope that we are able to make the right decisions to avoid these scenarios to arise in practice. And what do we say to people who say the initial conditions are such that there's almost no policy flexibility? The ECB has to address inflation. Fiscal space is limited and if you go too far, the bond vigilantes may come in. Just look at what has happened to the UK and the reality is that even if governments wish to move the amount of measures available to them is much more limited than in the past. It is indeed tricky. It's not easy to articulate economic policy these days. I think that one basic principle is a good coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. From the perspective of Spain, just to give you an example, we're very strongly committed to pursuing the path of deficit and debt reduction. I think that is going along and helping monetary policy implementation in the EU. I do hope that we find the right balance between fighting inflation and not endangering growth because if we want to pursue also fiscal responsibility, growth and job creation is a necessary function for it to be sustainable. Let's talk about the growth forecast from both the Bank of Spain and from the Spanish government. The Bank of Spain understands that for 2023 is at 1.4%. Your government is at 2.1%. Do you think that articulates that a Spanish people just how much pain this economy is about to go through? One thing that has been thrown at this Federal Reserve is that their forecasts have been unrealistic, that they have been too aspirational. Is that realistic or aspirational? No, it's realistic. Absolutely. We had very strong growth in 2021, around 5.5%. We are having very strong growth in 2022, around 4.4%. That's a quite prudent forecast. What we anticipate is a slowdown of growth in 2023. Obviously, the European economy is very much affected by what happens in Germany. It would be unrealistic, not to think that there will be a slowdown. All institutions, national, public, private, international, they foresee the Spanish economy continue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1806,2022-10-11 11:54:42
13581," It would be unrealistic, you know, not to think that there will be a slowdown. But all institutions, national, public, private, international, they foresee the Spanish economy to continue to grow in 2023. And there are some elements that make it particularly resilient and strong at this point in time. Whether it's the Fed's aggressive interest rates, hiking cycle, or the strength of the dollar, there's a perception that a lot of people are going to be going to Washington and talking to the American authorities and saying what you do here has major repercussions, not just for Europe, but beyond that, especially in the development world. And you, as you must have a global perspective. Do you think that's even a realistic conversation to have in Washington DC these days? I do think they are well aware of the impact of their decisions throughout the world, you know, just like putting actions in Ukraine are having a worldwide impact, which is not only having to do with security, defense, not only having to do with inflation, also food security is a key issue that we will certainly be talking about in the course of these weeks. I do think that the U.S. authorities are well aware of the impact of their decisions on emerging economies and on inflation throughout the world and growth throughout the world, of course. Do you think they should step back from this tiny cycle? Well, you know, I would never dare to say anything to a monetary policy authority. I hope that they will get it right, you know, both in the U.S. and in Europe. I mean, the sources of inflation are very different on both sides of the Atlantic. It's a demand driven, as well as supply driven inflation in the case of the U.S. It is really a supply side shock. You were talking about it just a moment ago. It's energy prices going up is the underlying cause of inflation in the EU. That would call for a differentiated monetary policy, but as you were rightly saying, interest rates are very, very sensitive and very important in this regard. And so that is driving the relationship between monetary policy in different parts of the world. I really hope they get it right. How gloomy is this going to be in a couple of days down in Washington? How depressing is this meeting going to be? Well, I think that we are quite used to tackling and dealing with crisis since you were referring to 2007, 2008. Yeah. I was already around at the time dealing with financial regulation. I think ever since we haven't really left a very complex scenario where multiple interrelationships are hitting each other and having an effect. So I think that it's good. We have the G20. It's good that we're meeting this week. And I hope we do have a good outcome in terms of articulation of a good economic policy at this point in time. Let's do that again soon. Diplomatic, as I would expect. Thank you. Nadiakal Vina, the Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, Vice President, thank you. Mohammed, fantastic to have you with us for an hour. It's a difficult moment. You know what Rick Reeder said on Friday? They haven't seen a market like this in his lifetime. Have you? Not this difficult. This is tough, right? This is very tough. It seems like every week is exhausting. But it's even tougher for policymakers. I couldn't agree more, particularly the ones sitting alongside us going through the rest of this year. Again, Nadiak, thank you. Nice president, thank you very much. Mohammed, thank you, sir. What a privilege. We're going to do this again. I hope so. Do you like this 7am slot? Would you prefer 8 o'clock? 9? I mean, your hands. I'm going to have a good time. From New York City this morning, good morning, futures lower by 1%. We'll catch up with Bramow with the next hour.

13582," So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received but that I've lived my whole life around is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor. A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. For a young person who now booking in a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always keen to make the money you want. The President has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. I don't think they will bring QT to an end early. The market is coming to terms with the idea that rates are going to go higher and they're going to stay there for longer as well. In a world of broadly bearish outlook for risk assets across the board, relative shelter is in the front end of the investment mid-carp. The next thing to really worry about is the CPI. This is Bloomberg's surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York sitting this morning, good morning, good morning for our audience worldwide. Fly solo through the next couple of hours. I'm Jonathan Farrow TK. We'll be down in DC for the IMF meetings later on this week. We'll catch up with Lisa in just a moment. Coming up later this week, not just the IMF meeting, CPI on Thursday and bank earnings coming up on Friday with JP Morgan kicking things off for you. In the market right now, this morning, we are lower by about 4.10 of 1% on ESMP 500. Yields are higher by 3 basis points, 3.9143 on a 10 year.

The Euro show in just a little bit of strength. And after a monster rally last week in the commodity market, WTI, $89.43, we're down there by 1.9%. I'm pleased to say, not flying completely solo because Lisa joined us now from the Greenwich Economic Forum. And Lisa in the next hour, a ton of fantastic guests coming right up. We do and I would never abandon you, honestly, as much as it is gorgeous here and I'm traveling down the Long Island Sound and trying to investigate the mood for alternative investors globally. I'm also thinking about you in your fabulous conversations with the Muhammadalarian in the prior hour coming up. We have a series of incredible guests, including Ned Lamont, the governor of Connecticut at a time of such flux. I mean, I really can't emphasize enough in terms of both taxes and terms of heading into a more tumultuous economic time. And also given the fact that there have been so many people who have come here, post-pandemic, Jim Zeltor, a polyglobal co-president. How do you invest as someone who focuses on private markets when suddenly public markets look pretty good? And Lawrence Gala, but of Gala Capital, also focused in this area. This is really a day. You've talked about this a lot, John, of bond vigilantes. So where does the marginal buyer come from? And where do they focus? Of course, we're also going to be hearing from Ray Dalio today of Bridgewater. He's going to be speaking with our own David Weston. We're also going to be hearing from Kathy Wood, of Arc Invest. And then we're also going to be hearing from Kip Devere of Aries Capital. So so many conversations, John, as we deal with the policy changes that we're going to be hearing about from Washington DC with Tom Down There. Here, it's about who is going to step up and what kind of yield they're going to be looking for. And Lisa, one thing we used to say when you get into a crisis, markets can start panicking when policy makers start to panic. We just talked about the IMF meetings in the last couple of hours. What's going to take place later this week? We had the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister reflect on the gloom that she might have to come up against. Mohamed talked about maybe the idea that this reminds him of, say, 2008, not because he thinks 2008 and what happened then is going to transpire now, but ultimately because it feels like that kind of moment feels big, important. Lisa, I've been missing your thoughts on that all morning. What's your take on that conversation? Well, have we heard that from policy makers in the United States? Have we heard that from the Fed? The concern here is in 2008, we did not see inflation like this. We did not see that kind of focus. So what's going to take for them to pull back from some of the rate hiking? And what we've heard from Layl Brainerd, what we've heard from pretty much everyone, Charlie Evans, really is this other discussion around getting rates up high and then leaving them there for a longer period of time. This is not the crisis kind of move that you're looking for. If you're an investor, this is going to inflict pain. So, you know, they're not necessarily panicking, maybe in the United Kingdom, they are. But elsewhere, they're not, which is the reason why those bond vigilantes can come out with evidences. Lisa, thank you. Looking forward to the conversations. Later this year. Lisa Bramford's there from the Granite Economic Forum. Bob Michael of JP Morgan asset management speaking to our colleagues here at Bloomberg. This is what he had to say. When the central bank steps on the brakes, something goes through the windshield, the cost of financing has gone up and it will create tension in the system. I read that quote out in the last hour. Mohammed responded to it. Take a listen to what Mohammed had to say. The economy is starting to go through windshield. The financial system is starting to go through windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. It is the most front-loaded, interesting cycle that we have seen in a very long time and it didn't need to be this. This is the tragedy of it, John. It didn't need to be this way. This is a self-inflicted wound by central banks. The brilliant Mohammed Al-Aryan in the previous hour, which I now by the brilliant Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jones Trading. Michael, let's start there. How bad is this going to be? I tend to agree with Mohammed, from his perspective, he gave the Fed. If they acted earlier, they could have stopped earlier and instead inflation got out of control and now they need to really get it under control, which is going to be a process and I think that's the issue the market's having right now. We're in this disability vacuum that people don't know what to do and we're not going to have a typical V bottom that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1809,2022-10-11 12:07:59
13584," process and I think that's the issue the market's having right now is we're in this disability vacuum that people don't know what to do and we're not going to have a typical V-bottom that markets have come to expect so it's just this uncertainty just keeps weighing on investors. Michael, is there a pocket of the market as you look cross asset across a range of securities where we haven't appropriately adequately discounted some of the economic pain that might be in our future? Oh, I think the equity market is that spot. I think Jamie Dymne was spot on saying that we could easily get out another 20%. If you go down 10%, you're looking at the the S&P 500 trailing PE will just be at the historic average at that point and there's a very strong case to be made with all the stimulus financial monetary stimulus in 2021 last year's earnings were some type of P. So we have to start discounting weaker earnings going forward in the future just because the interest rate environment. So I would say it's fair to say we could have that other next 20% down and then we still have to evaluate where are we and what's the business going to look like in an interest rate environment with a fed funds rate above 4%. Let's just sit on rates a little bit long. You mentioned that Jamie Dymne conversation with Juliana over at CNBC. This is what he said on rates, Michael, that caught my eye. Rates going up another 100 basis points is a lot more painful than the first 100 basis points because people aren't used to it. Michael did that resonate with you. What is it about the next 100 basis points that's harder than the previous 300? Well, it's funny. If you look at the consumer credit data we received on Friday, you'll see that consumers are barring at a tremendous pace this year. So consumer credit's up the monthly borrow is up 50% versus last year and that's about 100% against pre-pandemic years. So you're talking about people haven't adjusted to the higher interest rate. They're using their credit cards. They're using borrowing to kind of fill the holes right now. But as this process plays out and we're dealing with these higher interest rates, they're going to start retrenching as we head into year end and as we head into 2023. And then it's funny that circles back to the, you know, the comments that Mohammed was making that it's going to be slamming the brakes on. It's just taking a little time. They have their credit cards. They have their bar and providing that little bit of a lifeline between now and then. Michael, the longer variable lags of monetary policy, how much tightening is already in the pipeline that we've yet to fully realize the consequences of? Michael, I asked this question delicately and perhaps provocatively, but you can push back by all means. Do you think a recession is all but guaranteed based on what they've already done? I don't think it's all about guaranteed based on what they've done. I do fear, you know, I'm a person who would prefer to see the Fed be a little tighter, a little more hawkish, you know, traditionally. I do think the slaves forecast they gave is very aggressive. It's more aggressive than I would be. I think the pause level should be somewhere around 4% of the Fed funds rate. So we're not there yet. And again, but if they go to, if they raise the point of where their target is, I think that's going to bring a recession on. And that gives me a lot of concern going forward. Michael, can you get bullish about the prospect of a pause from this Fed? I can get bullish about the prospect of a pause, but we're still not anything near-attract evaluations for the environment we're in. I mean, when you think about all these developments, what's going on? Like these China chip sanctions and it's a different environment than that we experienced for the past decade. For the past two decades, we've had this low inflation environment due to globalization and China being the manufacturing center for the world, giving exporting low inflation. Obviously, that's shifting today. So we're heading into a new higher, not high inflation reason, but higher inflation regime. So we need to have positive real interest, positive real Fed funds rate, which we haven't had since the global financial crisis. And that's just a tougher growth environment, but that's where the Fed needs to head. And I think that's where we are heading. And I think that changes the investment outlook for everybody. It's going to be a much different environment going forward than we've seen for the past 10 or 12 years. People just don't use to this at all. Michael Bank of America came out with their outlook for earnings. And there was a quote from them that I pulled from Savita and the team, consensus feedback from clients.

13585," Census feedback from clients. Third quarter might hold up, but who cares? Guidance is going to be terrible. We expect a slight 1% miss in 3Q, but big downside risk starting in 4Q. Michael, did you agree with that assessment? I do. I think what's happened here is there's been this visibility back you. So analysts haven't had good guidance to go off of as far as projecting where trends in business are. I think we're going to see that with this earning season. But the problem is, as I, you know, where we start out, this is a process that's going to take time to play out, and that's what's wearing on markets. So we still won't have great visibility about 2023, because again, this interest rate environment, it's a generational height thing we're seeing. And, you know, as Mohammed said, we're slamming the brakes on. So the environment's going to look very different 2023 as far as a business environment. So you still can't have high confidence in the earnings estimates, still can't have high confidence in numbers, and that just demands a higher risk premium for investors to want to take, you know, to take a position in a star. Michael, final question, you sound like a man-hider than cash. Is there anywhere else to weather the storm? You know what? I think the most attractive out there right now is the two-year treasure note. I think that's incorporated all the Fed hikes that we should need in there. It's, I think it's very much priced in. They're yielding, you know, 4.25, 4.3%. I think that's a good place to be. If the Fed does have to, you know, pause earlier, I think they'll respond well. So that's the asset I like. There are, I do like the financial sector. I like the banks, but again, I think there should be much better opportunities in the equiliscute in 2023. We're here from the banks on Friday. Michael enjoyed it. It's got to catch up, buddy. Michael, I rocked there. I've judged trading. Thank you, sir. Fuegius Recavverin, just a little bit. We're down about a quarter of 1% on the S&P.

Group of seven leaders are scheduled to hold a call today during which Russia strikes on civilian targets are set to top the agenda. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has said the fresh assault was a retaliation for explosions on a multi-billion dollar bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for that incident. Afghanistan's Taliban-led government is working to build closer trade ties with Russia, as it looks to import fuel and wheat before winter sets in, according to a top official. Now, Afghanistan's Minister of Commerce and Industry says a Moscow offer of food grains and fuel at a discounted rate made the deal appealing. Ties between Moscow and Afghanistan have grown following the U.S. exit last year. Quetta Credit Suisse faces a shortfall of as much as $8 billion in 2024, according to Goldman Sachs. It's a further illustration of the trouble facing the Swiss lender, analysts estimate a whole of at least four billion Swiss francs and say an equity raise would be prudent given the need to restructure the investment banking operations at a time of minimal capital generation.

13586," conhecer shop What do Formula 1 cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickled down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. F1 cars from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust. That could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas guzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

You have to do a lot to catch up. If you do a lot to catch up, you may not notice that you've done more than that to actually sufficient.

13587," Can catch up with Lisa. Hey, Lisa. Hey, John, we're live from Connecticut from British Connecticut sitting in front of the Long Island Sound and here with us, VF Ned Lamont, the Democratic governor of from Connecticut, who has been in office in 2019. Thank you so much for joining us. And there are a lot of people who live here. It was really easy for them to come to this conference. Many of them who lived in New York City prior to the pandemic. Many people who have come, including businesses, how do you as the governor plan to keep them considering the pull the lure of low tax dates? I think we have one of the great education systems in the country. So a lot of people want to come here for their families to start things up. Stanford Greenwich has become a real financial center, FinTech center, you know, cryptocurrency financial services. Obviously we've got the insurance capital of the world. So there's a great ecosystem in base for finance. And I think a lot of we've had a lot of finance companies come up to Connecticut over the last few years. And we've noticed that right with all of them moving their headquarters to both Connecticut and also to Florida because it's a low tax state. You're running against Bob Saffnowski and they're about 30 days left in this election cycle. He's been espousing lowering taxes. You've previously raised taxes. How do you sort of speak to this issue given that you talk about the education system? You talk about some of the services that cost money? Well, to be exact, we inherited a $2 billion budget deficits as far as the eye can see. And we balanced that by holding the line on spending. It was the first governor in 30 years, not to raise income taxes. And this last year, we put in place the biggest middle class tax cut there is. But making life a little more affordable in this inflationary time. But bigger, you're right. I've gotten place a rainy day fun. I'm going to hear from the finance people here today, whether I'm airing on the side of caution. I hope I am, but I'm going to be ready. You said that you're going to be listening to Ray Dahlio talk about how the world's about to implode. And then you're going to sit there and hide under your chair as you try to prepare your budget. How do you plan to really withstand whatever is to come given the negativity out there and given that it is hard to borrow right now with rates where they are? Well, two things. I've got a 15% of our budget set aside in cash. We call it the rainy day fun. So if capital gains start slipping, which it already has, you know, we'll be ready. I don't have to raise taxes. I don't have to cut education, you know, funding going forward. I budgeted very conservative for this fiscal year. I think we could see sort of the storm clouds out there. I assumed we were going to have less revenues this year already. So I think we're ready for what may be coming. I go back to the election cycle because this is the midterm election cycle. I'm sure you are more aware of than anybody else. In Bopsipinowski, your opponent does keep talking about the importance of keeping some of the businesses here to keep the revenues. How do you balance lowering taxes to be competitive with states that have really drawn a lot of Wall Street businesses with you to the money to actually make the state livable? Look, we had a couple of Fortune 500 companies move into the state. We had dozens of other companies, but least more importantly, a lot of our local companies are growing and expanding big time. We had more new business startups than ever before. You know, I've often said I don't want more taxes, but I don't mind more tax payers. Our economic pie is growing and that's why we have a surplus. So your tone has shifted a little bit in the election cycle with more focus on just get out and vote. Why is there the emphasis on getting people to vote? Do you think that there is something that will keep Democrats home? I think anger sometimes motivates people. I'm more optimistic. I believe in the state. I've got to make people believe we're turning things around. We're making progress every day. And I don't want people to be complacent. I want you to have a stake in this election. So yeah, vote. All right. So going forward, how concerned are you about some of the businesses that have been leaving given the low tax issue and given the fact that some of the revenues are going to be strained for possibly years if what Radalio says comes to pass? I think a lot of the companies that are coming to Connecticut and staying in Connecticut, A, respect tax stability. They know that for the first time in years we have not raised taxes. That makes a big deal. But it's bigger than that. Again, they love the best education system in the country. They love the fact that we provide job training so they'll get the people they need and the skills they need. Do you feel like there's a shift right now? And we talk about this all the time on Bloomberg surveillance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1813,2022-10-11 12:25:09
13588," They love the fact that we provide job training, so they'll get the people they need and the skills they need. on Bloomberg surveillance about how there is constraint on the fiscal response to crises at this moment. Because when you're dealing with inflation, you're dealing with a situation where you cannot borrow money in the same kind of way. How are you preparing for that with the lack of ability to plug gaps with simply selling bonds? Hey, look, there's a big macroeconomic world out there and we're a small piece of it. We get buffeted by international and national things. All I can do is prepare. And I've prepared by making sure we have a lot of dry patterns. I suggested it before. Billions of dollars set aside. I can't go out and borrow my way out of this. Maybe that's a little game they play in wash and you can't do that at the state level. And when you look out today and you hear all of these executives of major alternative investment firms, many of which, including Apollo, we're going to be speaking with Apollo coming up, have moved recently to Connecticut. What are you listening to? What have you heard from them that you find most compelling to sort of shape your narrative going forward? I think they like being here. They don't necessarily have to be in New York City or Boston, depending on, you know, five days a week. Maybe it's one or two days a week. Otherwise, I think they like the lifestyle here. They like the ecosystem. They like the fact we have a very well trained smart, educated workforce. It helps them grow and expand right here. Do you have more tax hikes planned for anyone? I know that there were tax hikes overall. Perhaps not for the middle class, but overall there were some tax hikes that you did with your first budget. Do you plan on doing that again? Or was that a one time thing? No, we didn't we didn't do that. As I said, I was the first guy not to raise the income tax on anybody. And we're not doing that. People want tax stability. They want to say, what's the state not only look like now, but what's it going to look like in five years so they can plan according to that? I come out of the business world. I need to know what the world's going to look like in a few years so I can put together my projections and make them happen. Why are you a Yankees fan? They like to win. And blow blow after the message. Sorry, Matt family. And we are looking at a situation after the meds going on. And you've been trying to encourage C.V. Cohen, who is also a resident of your state to buy your local team. Is that correct? Yeah, we have the yard goats. It's an amazing minor league baseball team up at Hartford. Yeah, and I'd like to thought boy, if you want to get a foothold here, bigger and Connecticut buy the yard goats and make them a mixed franchise. So that's your pitch to him. That's my pitch. So give us the inside scoop. Is he going to buy? I think he plays his cards pretty close to the best. I think so too. Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Governor of Connecticut here with us in Greenwich coming up. We're going to be speaking with Jim Zeltar of Apollo Global Management as we take a look at the scene forward at a time of incredible tumult.

Hi John, so right now we're talking all morning about the bond vigilantes. Right now we have someone who has been in the bond market for decades, Jim Zeltar, co-president of Apollo Global, who has really helped found the entire credit business, which now has more than $350 billion of assets under management. And as John's been talking about all morning, this was the day of bond vigilantes. This is the year of bond vigilantes. And this is raising so much fear among people who have gotten used to zero rates over such a long period of time. Are you more nervous today or more excited? Well, you got to respect it. First of all, nice to be here this morning. You know, certainly there's a big paradigm ship going on right now. And you have to respect the markets. As you said, the bond vigilantes, they'll get rates where they should be, more so than the Fed or the Central Banks. But it's an interesting paradigm shift where you see where rates have been. And we've been in this period where there's been an undue focus on low rates and its put valuations very, very high. So it's a period of transition. You have to respect it, but also you want to be on your front foot, which we've been able to do over the last several months. And we'll continue to do so. What does that mean? Well, what it really means is if you've been prudent the last decade and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1815,2022-10-11 12:33:34
13590," But also you want to be on your front foot, which we've been able to do over the last several months and we'll continue to do so. What does that mean? Well, what it really means is if you've been prudent the last decade and not been over your skis and valuations and have been thoughtful about what you've put on the books, there's a very interesting time. The cost of capital now matters, purchase price matters, and those who have capital and have a lot of flexibility in their toolbox, you will find many interesting companies from which to give capital to. Are you taking more risks right now or less risks than you were a month ago? You know, we're measured. We run a very, very large platform, as you said, over $550 billion in aggregate, over almost $400 billion in debt. You really can't pick the bottom. It's really impossible to predict. You can prepare along the way. But we are methodically putting opportunities to work. We've been active in the COL-O market. We've been active in working with some of the banks on the large stocks, and the locations, cittricks in particular. So, you know, I think I have a healthy respect for what's going on, but I don't think we are in the corner of Cal ring by any means. I love the sanitized language that you're using, and then I think about some of the stories that you've written, including you're talking about COL-Os, we've worked with banks, we've helped them. You made incredible amounts of money, especially recently with UK COL-Os in the wake of some of the volatility, with Citrix, the banks that are all with all of these hung bridge loans, right? Commitments that they made to finance mergers and acquisitions that are perhaps not priced the way that they were at the time of commitment. How many opportunities do you have to go in and buy some of these assets for the banks? Well, if you just put today in context with a decade or so ago, in the GFC, the banks were arguably long, 500 plus billion of loans and high yield. Today, that number is circa 80 to 100 billion. So it's a much smaller opportunity set and much fewer, you know, not as many names. So we have a constant dialogue where a very active trader with the banks, you know, no permanent friends, no permanent enemies. We act very, very in great dialogue with them, but on certain names, we will partner in many regions, especially in the US and Europe, with the large banks. Are they willing to sell? Well, I think you have to have a realistic dialogue and it's a challenging position. I think they want to move on, they want to get back in business. I mean, the reality is the high yield financing markets are arguably shut down right now. And I think that they would like to be in the position to be able to make new loans at appropriate levels and get paid fairly for those. So it's going to be an interesting period of transition between now and the end of the year. Traditionally, alternative asset managers, including Apollo, have lights investing in credit that is not traded very often, right? You invest in a company, you get more control, you also have higher yields. Is that the same now or do you find more opportunities in the public credit markets given that yields are now north of 10% in many cases and arguably north of 8% even for pretty high rated credits? Well, there's a lot, a lot you brought up there. In our credit business, we are really a performing investor. We're looking to extend capital to companies that are growing and get paid back. So there's not really a distressed angle in our typical credit business. As you raised, when you had the dislocation we've had thus far, there are opportunities in the public markets within the investment grade market, with low dollar price, long duration assets, pretty interesting opportunities. In the private markets, new capital is coming with better terms and better pricing. So at this unique period right now where there's actually opportunities in the higher end of both of those markets, it's interesting. High yield on a yield basis is somewhat attractive. On a spread basis, it's sort of historical levels. The spreads this morning are mid-500s approaching 600. That's typically a time when you get interested in high yield. Right now the yields are approaching 10%, which is a very attractive number. So, you know, it's my view that having done this for a few decades now, things are happening faster and faster and faster. The rate rise in the U.S. and globally in the last six months has been historic and not only the speed, which has happened, but also...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1816,2022-10-11 12:38:01
13591," faster and faster. The rate rise in the U.S. and globally in the last, you know, six months has been historic in not only the speed, which has happened, but also the amount. And in the past, that might have happened over 12, 18, 24 months. So it's my suspicion that by the time we really are officially in a recession in 23 or 24, the opportunity to buy paper will, some of it will have evaporated. So you have to be measured and patient along the way. Do you think we're going to see a default cycle akin to what we saw in 2008 or even some of the prior ones in early 2000s? Yes, you will see some degree of a default cycle. When you can't slow down the economy with the breaks that the monetary policy is leading to today without expecting some accidents, it's going to happen. Resid more gong is gone from the low to mid two is to north of 6%. There's going to be a default cycle. It may not be as pervasive, it may not be as wide and deep, but there will be some companies and also not only the amount of debt, but the actual interest cost have increased dramatically on a floating rate basis. What's more attractive to you at this point, looking for those idiosyncratic companies where you want to invest in or investing in niche investors that actually going to other asset managers is saying, we'll give you money, we'll give you a stake in our assets and go at it. My answer is obviously both. You know, you're alluding to our recent announcements in diameter in sofa Nova in Haveli. These are all great managers that are proven there, they're wisdom and their judgment over time in their in their strut strategies. We're providing capital for them to grow. At the same time, we're very active on our own accounts. So, you know, we have a large platform, we're connected to a lot of folks, but I think from us, you'll see a strategy of being able to do both of those in concert. You mentioned CLOs and I mentioned the United Kingdom. I know that that has been a public issue in terms of how much money you made buying CLOs at the right time and then seeing a policy response from the Bank of England. How much are you playing in the UK market right now? Well, I think from our perspective, the UK market, you know, it is a robust economy going through some great challenges. And, you know, we were very active in post the GFC and the Rezzy Market place over there. I suspect in the residential market and the commercial real estate market, you'll see us active over the next couple of years as they go through their challenges in the economy. It's early, you know, really our activity in the CLO market was really US and broadly Europe was some in the UK. But as you said earlier, like the CLO market right now, if you look at the most senior tranches, it's a pretty drag-coney assumption. They're assuming 10 plus percent defaults for the next five years, which we think in some cases an opportunity to be a buyer. And is Europe a similar story kind of taking place or is that? Yes, I mean, in my view, Europe is a bit behind the US in terms of it's always a bit tighter when the market's tight and it accentuates the wide's and periods of volatility. So there's plenty for us to focus on right now in the US. I think Europe and the UK will be a 23 and 24 opportunity set. But certainly the US is our primary focus right now. When we talk about investing alongside some smaller niche investors, do you have any interest in a big European bank that might be going through some distressed that might be splitting up certain aspects of its business? Would you ever be interested in acquiring certain aspects of that business? Well, you know, over the last I said it, since 8.09, there's been many instances in 2012 and 2015 where we had strategies that really partnered with the banks or were an off-tank for the banks. Whether it was credit cards, subsidy areas in Spain and Ireland, whether it was real estate portfolios in Germany and the UK, we were always there as a partners like we were in 0.08 and 0.09 for the US bank. So if there's a global bank and they are considering large scale strategic transactions, we certainly expect to be part of those dialogues. How much does your base case include 4 to 4.5 percent Fed funds rates for perhaps a year or even two? You know, I think that's going to be the base case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1817,2022-10-11 12:42:15
13592," include four to four and a half percent Fed funds rates for perhaps a year or even two. You know, I think that's got to be the base case. You were in a higher rate regime that has shocked the system and the monetary policy makers are trying to really shock the economy on this nasty concept of inflation. So you have to expect we're in a higher rate period for some period of time. We're not macro investors. You got plenty of other folks that can come up here and talk to you. But we're certainly in a higher rate regime for some period of time. And that's definitely shaping this view in terms of what's required in terms of payment from a lot of these companies. Jim Celter, thank you so much for taking the time. Oh, it's a pleasure. A co-president of Apollo Global, really great to get some perspective, John, here as we freeze outside because it is really cold suddenly. Bramow, stay warm. Stay warm. Lisa, great work.

Keeping you up to date with Newsroom Around the World, with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Ukraine's allies say they will support it for as long as it takes, despite Russia's recent steps to escalate its war there. That's what the group of seven major industrialized nations plan to say in a statement later today. Now in a draft statement obtained by Bloomberg, the group says, quote, we will continue to provide financial humanitarian, military, diplomatic and legal support and stand firmly with Ukraine for as long as it takes. A G7 video conference is taking place one day after Russia launched missile strikes in Kiev and other cities. Israel and Lebanon have reached what's being called an historic agreement to settle their maritime dispute. According to Israeli Prime Minister Yehr Levin's office, now in a text message, his office said the deal quote, will strengthen Israel's security and jack billions into Israel's economy and ensure the stability of the country's northern border. A renewed push for Scottish independence is set to force its way onto UK Prime Minister Liz Truss' agenda. The debate over a second referendum on Scotland breaking with the rest of the UK goes to the Supreme Court in London today. Truss' conservatives who are in opposition in Scotland, accuse the Scottish National Party government of pursuing a, quote, self-serving, obsessive push. Mercedes Ben sales rose by more than a fifth during the third quarter, piercing through ongoing supply chain bottlenecks and an increasingly negative economic outlook as consumers battle surging inflation. The luxury automaker delivered nearly 518,000 vehicles globally in the third quarter. That's up 21 percent compared to the same period a year ago, with demand in China leading strong growth.

13593," Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16, by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish. The complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. The market is coming to terms with the idea that rates are going to go higher, and they're going to stay there for longer as well. The bit that the market is still playing around with is this recession. You know, a lot of people still thinking that soft landing is possible, we think is very unlikely, and with recession, unfortunately, does come. And it's a recession. ThemeShah Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, brilliant yesterday talking about why she is just as gloomy as sometimes we get accused of being sometimes, maybe not always. Not ever gloomy, Michael McKee. He is in Washington right now for all of the meetings down there, although I suspect it is somewhat gloomy there. Bloomberg Economics and Policy Correspondent, Mike, what's coming up this week? Can you give us a sense of just what the mood is over there with the International Monetary Fund as well as the IAF as well as the World Bank? You know, Lisa, it's interesting to remember that this is the first time in three years now that all of these people have gathered in person in Washington for these meetings. So there's a sense of happiness at that, but there's a real pervasive sense of gloom around the global economy. The IAF Institute for International Finance is a group representing the world's biggest banks, and they gather economists and political leaders and investors from around the world bankers. So we're having a conference the first four days of this week, and everybody there is basically suggesting that you got a batten down.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1819,2022-10-11 12:50:45
13594," investors from around the world bankers. They're having a conference the first four days of this week, and everybody there is basically suggesting that you got to batten down the hatches, that things are not going to be good, that 2023 looks rather bad. The Fed minutes come out tomorrow from the last meeting, be a lot of focus on that to see what they think about how long they're gonna have to keep raising rates, and then of course that whole idea of the Fed raising rates and the world raising rates is gonna be sort of topic one along with Ukraine at the IMF World Bank meetings, because the higher the central banks around the world take interest rates, the more it squeezes those who are not prepared, the emerging markets are hanging in, but they have a lot of dollar debt, and the dollar of course keeps getting stronger and stronger. We've heard from a lot of central bankers, we've heard from a lot of Fed members, some people would argue too much, but for weeks there was an apparent singing from the same hymn sheet, right? There was a feeling that all of the Fed members were on the same page. And over the past, I don't know, 24, 48 hours, we heard from Leo Brainer and a few others who had a slightly different tone, they seemed to emphasize the necessity to not overtighten, to not make a policy error on the other side. Do you think that's significant, or is this just basically emphasizing something they've been saying all along? It's basically something they've been saying all along, but I think they're emphasizing it now because we are getting closer to the terminal rate, the rate at which they want to stop, and they do want to get there, and they don't want pressure from the markets, and they don't want the markets to price in too far as well. So they're letting people know, yes, we are aware of your concerns, we're aware of the possibility we could go too far, and so we aren't going to do that. We're going to stop when we need to stop, but they still, according to their latest forecasts, they're 125 basis points below that. So some combination of 75, 25, or 50, at the next two meetings, is probably still to be expected. Given this backdrop, how important, Mike, is what we're going to see on Thursday? Well, Thursday is going to be very important because the CPI is going to come out, and I would argue that it's going to be more important for the markets than it is for the Fed, because the markets are so jittery about inflation, if it comes in worse than expected, well, that's not going to change the Fed's view that they're going to go 75 basis points, but if it comes in worse than expected, it may change the market's view of where the terminal rate is going to be, how much higher the Fed will have to go, and that could cause some real problems. Now, so far, as that Governor Christopher Waller noted this week, the markets are functioning fine in the United States, can't say that about every market, but it could raise questions about, at what point, does something break? So there's a lot riding on what the CPI comes out with on Thursday morning. Okay, so very much to that point, we were hearing our earlier John and Muhammad Al-Aryan were talking about how, you know, as an investor, you can start getting excited when policymakers panic. They do not seem panicked yet. If anything, they seem panicked about inflation, which is the wrong kind of panic that some of these investors would like to see, what will be the trigger, especially if you have CPI, so coming in strong, if you still have this feeling of inflation, is there a sense of what breakage would actually get Fed officials' attention in some sort of responsive way? Well, you know, there's an old saying that a recession on Wall Street is when your trade loses money. So the Fed is aware that they're going to get a lot of complaints from investors about their policies because it makes it harder for them to make money. What they're going to be watching for is whether you can trade. Now, we've seen in England over the last couple of days, a couple of weeks, that there are trades that maybe don't go through because you get into this doom loop of margin calls and depressed prices. But so far, that's not happening in the United States. That's what they would watch for. The problem is, the problem is that they're not going to be, problems in the banks. They're going to be in the shadow financial sector. Banks are pretty well capitalized and much heavier scrutinized these days. But you don't know what you don't know is going on in the shadow sector, which is the position that the Bank of England found itself in. And so that's what people are going to be worried about. But the Fed is, at this point, very aware of that possibility, not sure they can do much about it except keep vigilant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1820,2022-10-11 12:55:25
13595," And so that's what people are going to be worried about. But the Fed is at this point very aware of that possibility, not sure they can do much about it except to keep vigilant. Mike, I'm glad that you brought up the United Kingdom. We saw the second intervention in 24 hours from the Bank of England. As it is very clear that the pension problem has not gone away there. There is this inability to trade, but it raises this question about how balance sheets of central banks will be used at a time when many of them would like to see quantitative tightening. And that quantitative easing is easing. How much have you heard from US central bankers that they are taking a look at the balance sheet roll off and that perhaps it will not be watching paint dry? Well, so far, their view is that it is still watching paint dry that it's working fine. Christopher Waller summed up kind of the overall view of the Fed this week when he said, look, the markets are giving the Fed back to trillion dollars every day in the reverse repo facility. So there is plenty of liquidity out there. It's not a liquidity problem. It's a question of who has the liquidity? Banks don't want more securities. So they're not putting money up to the Fed. And so there may be some regulatory issues that the Fed could address like the supplementary leverage ratio that could ease that a little bit. But beyond that, they don't think there's a problem yet with the balance sheet and its size. They're going to keep going with that for now. You don't want to get into a position, as you mentioned, with the Bank of England, where they have two monetary policies working at cross-purposes to each other. You mentioned earlier, Mike, that tomorrow we get some of the meeting minutes from the Federal Reserve. What will be important to look for, especially given all the communication that we get every day? Well, I think the two things people on Wall Street are going to be looking for is certainly some sort of indication of where they're going to stop and when they're going to stop. If there's a view on that about how far they can go, how much concern do members have about overtightening? That's going to be one of the questions that people ask. And the other is going to be, what does the Fed think about how long they want to keep interest rates up? How, what is their view of inflation? We got their views on where they think inflation's going to be in the summary of economic projections. But what do they really think about how fast it can come down? Michael McKee, thank you so much.

The S&P trying to recover going into the open and bow. The countdown to the open starts right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Pera. Life from New York, we begin with the big issue, markets on edge. We worry about recession, fighting inflation and financial stability. It's a major macro headwind. It's a difficult journey. The Fed has been very explicit until we see concrete signs of inflation peaking. Until we see a change in what's happening in the labor market. They're going to be done after slowing in the economy. The markets have been looking for any window of change in Pivot and I just don't think it's there. There's no pivot. The Fed has got to keep going. It's all about the Fed. It's all about central banks. We can kind of see this train the wreck in motion and slow motion, so to speak. The difficulty of balancing growth inflation and financial stability. We know the labor market is going to continue to slow and at the same time the Fed is going to continue to hike. Navigating through this is going to be incredibly bumpy. I'm Mr. Guy, the IMF with a warning. The worst is yet to come with more. It's my McKay, Mono Mike. Good morning, John. Well, it's a train wreck in slow motion in the IMF. Is that happening? And these chances of avoiding it as declining the chief economist at the IMF Pierre Olivier Gourinche is saying, in short, the worst is yet to come. For many people, 2023 is going to look like and feel like a recession. And that is for the world. For a lot of countries, it's going to be worse. The IMF sees unusually large risks this year. Russia, of course, with the Ukraine war continues to powerfully destabilize the global economy, they say. Inflation, it should peak by the end of the year, but it's going to remain higher for longer, slower to come down. China's COVID lockdowns and a weakening property sector there are ongoing risks and monetary policy as your guests set at the top there. The ever strong.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1822,2022-10-11 13:04:03
13597," ongoing risks and monetary policy as your guests set at the top there. The ever stronger dollar and the risk of miscalibration keep the world on edge. Their latest forecasts show that they expect slower growth and higher inflation for longer. The US is going to grow 1.6 percent this year, which is a seven tenths decline from their last forecast in July. Only 1 percent next year. The Eurozone barely avoids recession, as does the UK next year. And China going to grow extremely slowly, a little bit of a comeback, but not very much compared to what they usually do. Inflation, going to come down dramatically in the US with the Fed tightening from 8.1 to 3.5 percent. But in the Eurozone, it stays strong. In the UK, it barely moves. And China's comes down just a little bit remains high. So a gloomy forecast from the IMF, and it's summed up by the chief economist saying the worst is yet to come as world leaders and bankers and investors gather here in Washington for the annual meetings of the IMF, World Bank and IIF. It is a doer outlook from pretty much everybody. And Mike, we caught up with Mohammed Al-Aryan a little bit earlier this morning. I want you to reflect on what he had to say. Take a listen. The economy is starting to go through the windshield. The financial system is starting to go through the windshield. This is not stepping on the brakes. This is slamming the brakes. It didn't need to be this. This is the tragedy of it, John. It didn't need to be this way. This is a self-inflicted wound by Central Banks. This is going to be a reminder a little bit of October 2008 when people gather in Washington and realize we have a global problem that needs global solution. Mike, I'd love your response to that final line from Mohammed just there. Yeah, I think it's a little much to say it's parallel to 2008 because then you did have Lehman Brothers going down about the time the IMF and World Bank were meeting. And that set off a chain reaction in global markets that couldn't be contained. We do have declining economy and higher inflation now and a lot of individual problems. But nothing is systemic as that yet. His analogy to a card though is interesting because I did a panel yesterday at the IIF and one of the members there, one of the members of my panel said, you know what's happened is the Fed and other Central Banks missed the stop sign. And now they're going straight down hill trying to step on the brakes and stop but the brakes may not work. Mike McKee, thank you sir. That's problematic to say the least. Mike, great coverage as always looking forward to it through the wake and through today as well. JP Morgan's Bob Michael started this. He's the guy we complain. He said the following. When the Central Bank steps on the brakes, something goes through the windshield. The cost of financing has gone up and it will create tension in the system. Do you want to guess now as Blackbrox way Lee? JP Morgan's Clinton Warren. Way Lee, first of you. What's going through the windshield here? Well, in our assessment, we are in a new regime characterized by much tougher trade-offs facing Central Banks because of the supply constraint environment that we're in. So in order to fight inflation, which is the sole focus for Central Banks and this juncture, it's going to carry much higher cost to the economy but also financial stability. So in our assessment, to bring inflation down to targets quickly enough, actually, it would require a two percent shot to the US economy next year and also an additional three million people out of a job pushing unemployment rate to 5 percent. So these are the sort of very, very heavy cost facing Central Banks, which is why we believe that in the near term, they will fight inflation at all cost. But at some point early next year, first half of next year, they would pause this very aggressive rehikes as the damages from going very, very aggressively becomes clear both to the economy as well as to financial markets. Clinton, this is the policy makers trillema right now. How do you support growth, get inflation down and at the same time preserve financial stability? What gives? Yes, it's really tough out there. Every Monday, I joined a volunteer organization and we usually talk about helping the kids or special projects and anything that everyone wanted to talk about yesterday was the recession, inflation, Jamie comments, etc. And I said, hey guys, like I'll just tell you guys what I told the fellow. As I said, listen, we are going through a lot. We've had two negative quarters of GDP. There's an in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1823,2022-10-11 13:08:25
13598," etc. And I said, hey guys, like I'll tell you guys what I told to the fellow. As I said, listen, we are going through a lot. We've had two negative quarters of GDP. There's an inverted yield curve to last time I checked two to tens or 42 bips inverted. Inflations over 8 percent. The feds behind the early revisions are coming down. Sentiments bad. There's a war like what, of course, a recession probability increases that every day that goes on, every Fed hiked that that increases. And to everyone's comments, yeah, the fed is behind the curve. They thought inflation was inflation and transitory. They didn't move quick enough. And that's the old focus is how do we get inflation down? Unfortunately, it's not coming down as quick as they want or as quick as market needs it to. Well, let's go to the Anticipatory Asset class. So let's talk about what they're anticipating, Clinton. And how long they've been doing it for. The IMF is warning about something. This market has been fearing for months. When just not to lean the other way. Well, I mean, I was looking at some data here recently. And you got to look at what happens and then previous recessions. And when the previous recession happens, earnings come down about 30 percent. The consensus for 2023 earnings are around 230. You haircut that by 30 percent that gets you to earnings around 160. You apply multiple to that that gets you down to like the 2800. So if the recession is likely and history is any indication, there could be downside. I think at 10 percent below from here, I'd start leaning in and start lagging in. And it all once again becomes back to someone's time horizon. If you have three, five, seven years, you know, now could look interesting. If your time horizon is a little bit shorter, you may want to fit on the sidelines because it's going to be a bumpy ride over the next 12 months. Well, Lee, what are the preconditions for you to lean in? Part of it is around understanding when central banks could pause this aggressive rate hike cycle. And it has two steps. Number one, central banks specifically the Fed needs to acknowledge the very tough trade-off, exceptionally tough trade-off right now facing them. And number two, choosing to leave with inflation, recognizing that a hiking rate aggressively does not solve for supply bottlenecks. So this two step process is what we're looking for for us sustained kind of pause in the aggressive rate hike cycle. Now having said that, everything has a price. Yes, risks of recession have increased. We are expecting a recession and also risks of policy over tightly and slamming the breaks have in fact become the base case. The priorities have also corrected a lot, right? So there is a level at which point we can say that actually a recession is in the price. So our estimate is about another 7% actually down from here reflecting both the higher cash path as well as the earnings recession that we expect. And at that point we can say, well, there's a lot of bad news out there but also a lot of bad news are in the price. I'll catch up with Mike Wilson and Morgan Stanley in about 21 minutes time. Took a quote from his research to kick off the week and this is what the quote read like. Markets often need the engraved invitation from a higher power to tell them what's going on. For the bond markets it's the Fed and for Starks Clinton it's company management teams. Clinton do you expect management teams this earnings season to kitchen sink it with guidance? Well, I mean it is something that we've been watching very closely and you have seen numerous reports from a C-suite executive talking about a controlling discretionary spending. So what will we focus on is what does that mean to the margins? If the consumer is still spending at a high level and corporations are cutting down expenses there be a room for increased earnings. Our forecast right now is that Q3 earnings come in about 2% higher than last quarter. But yeah, I mean it's something that we're watching very closely is not only the numbers but more importantly the guidance that the CEOs and TSOs get this next couple. Clinton just out of interest because you brought it up and I didn't so this is your fault not mine if your PR complains. How do you deal with questions when your CEO starts talking about an extra 20% downside?

13599," Yeah, I mean, I think one of the benefits of working at a firm like ours is our our CEO calls it exactly how he sees it and It's it's it's made it a good place to be as as we've been the the safe bearing of banks and financial assets through most crisis and recessions But it's it's a it's a probability. It's not the base case But it is something that people should be should be aware of I do think that something that's going to be a silver lining Is the job position usually when you think of recessions you think of loss work layoffs the consumer not being able to spend But we let the data doesn't show that right now 10 million open jobs 1.8 open jobs for people looking at it unemployment fell People are still creating jobs so the job thing is really is what I think is going to make this a shallow recession and something that will make Eat a longer session as some people are forecasting diplomatic Fantastically executed Clinton Warren there sticking with us alongside way lead coming up on this program markets Filling the pain as Fed Hikes work their way through the economy It's going to take some time for that cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and for inflation to come down That conversation coming up next See Vietnamese consumers are very aspirational You've got millions of people riding motorbikes and they want to be riding inside cars.

13600," us right now with Limburg's Maimakia alongside Cadillac here in New York. Maimakia first to use a warning from Hamid. A warning from Mohammed, but an answer from Leo Brainerd, although the answer came first. Some hearts on Wall Street went to Peter Paner yesterday when she said that because they thought maybe it means the Fed is about to back off. But really, I think what she's saying is the Fed is aware of the potential for problems that Mohammed is talking about and is taking that into its calculations when it's thinking about how far to go. But it doesn't mean they're stopping. You look at what New York Fed President John Williams said this past week that the Fed's commitment to achieve and sustain 2% inflation is now a bedrock principle. His comments are important because the Vice Chair by tradition never descents. So he's seen it as a bell weather for Chairman J. Powell. The Fed's not close to its target for the year yet. They're media and forecast, which they may just three weeks ago has rates going up another 125 basis points by the end of the year. So even though Brainerd sounded maybe a hair more dovish, the markets are still projecting a 75 basis point move on November 2nd. And that could be cemented on Thursday when we get the September CPI headline forecast forecast to rise core forecast to rise a tad slower, but still very strong. So the dollar goes up the world still has to worry about the things breaking aspect of Mohammed's comment. Particularly in the bond market, can he lines again the Treasury market all over the place? Yeah. And of course, the Treasury market is playing a little bit of catch up to what we saw in places like the UK yesterday as the bond market here in the US was closed for the holiday. And in the UK, they're really trying to deal with what you could probably call bond vigilantes. What Mohammed was likely referring to the Bank of England announcing even further steps today to try to rein things in the bond market. And yet you're seeing once again the 30 year yield in the UK pushing higher by about four basis points. Of course, we're pushing higher here in the US as well. Although that has up about four basis points on the 10 year were essentially unchanged at the short end. But just on the point of where the 10 year is now and where the two year is now for that matter. Remember just a few weeks ago when we hit about 4% on the 10 year, about 4.3 on the two year and everybody said, Oh, that was it. The peak is now in. We're now retesting those levels. It seems time and again, we are too early to call the peak. Now, what the same is also true on the 10 year real yield, which right now is that the highest level since April of 2010, up about 111 basis points over the last 30 days were around 1.66%. All of this is the market is still pricing and cuts over the next years. Mike was just running through where the Fed has seen getting to by the end of this year. But this market is still expecting that by the end of 2023, we will have seen a rate cut more to come in 2024, even though the Fed has tried to push back against that narrative. The market seemed to think that they are right and the Fed is wrong and the inflation data we get this week probably going to make a big difference in that narrative, John. Hey, Kelly. Thank you. Kelly, lines there and Mike McKee. Kelly's right. We've placed the Fed pivot, the Fed pause, peak rates, peak inflation, 50 different ways over the last 12 months. Vice Chair Brainerd talked about how much they've already done. And we know they've done 300 basis points in the last six months. She talked about a two year, three, four percent for the first time since 2007, a 10 year near decade highs, mortgage rates doubling more than doubling this year. And a Fed's broad dollar index appreciating 11 percent year to date. Wailey, I'd love your view on how much tightening you think is in the pipeline that's yet to be realized in this economy. Well, I think this long and variable lag of the transmission mechanism is also precisely why we could see over the tightening. So our expectation for peak rates for the Fed is actually 5 percent, which is even higher than the current market pricing of peak rate. I would say one thing, though, also as we head into CPI this week, if we have an upside surprise, it could reinforce the resolve of the Fed to over tighten. But if we have a downside surprise, one data point is not going to sway them from there. So there's a bit of an asymmetrical kind of a risk as we're entering to this very, very important data print. But one more thing, I would say when it comes to investment implication of this is that as we head into recession, typically investors may want to hide in government bonds because that's when central banks will start cutting rates. But in this recession this new Siege gross creature will be arriving at the standards from King MillDC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1826,2022-10-11 13:21:42
13601," investors may want to hide in government bonds because that's when central banks will start cutting rates. But in this recession that we're entering into in the US is likely going to be engineered by central bank over tightening. So, government bonds is not where we would want to hide. Long duration is actually not a safe place to hide. So whilst we see opportunities on the front end of the curve because of the income and carry, we don't want to own the long end of the curve for this precise reason. You're clear, and since you agree with that, where can you hide? Yeah, I mean, I think in these circumstances where there's so many divergent views among economists, analysts, researchers, etc. You have to know and you have to take with what you're given to what do we know right now? One, we know that volatility's increased. We know that rates are higher and are moving higher. And three, we know that inflation is here and we'll probably be here a lot longer than any of us would like. So with those, with that as a backdrop, we hear Tom Klein to look at structure products where you can use option packages to expressive view, give you some downside protection and some upside participation. Two, we kind of like core bonds here. I mean, they've been boring for such a long time, but getting 4, 5, 5 and a half percent on some of your core bond exposure seems like an interesting trade to us. And then third, you've got to look at real assets to fight inflation whether it's infrastructure, transportation, vehicle solutions, etc., real estate. I do think of those three things. So look at structured notes to play the ball and interest rate game, lock in longer rates with core bonds and then look at real assets to fight inflation. Can I wrap things up by just asking you both the same question? Ray Dalio of Bridgewater just caught up with my colleague and friend David Weston over at the Greenwich Economic Forum. And he said that he fears a negative or poor real return for perhaps even five years. Ray, can I get your response to that? I think return expectations needs to be adjusted to reflect the higher macro uncertainty as well as the higher market uncertainty. Now, having said that, if you have that long investment horizon, actually a recent market volatility, public market and private market to some extent, create that longer term opportunities. So if you have that long term horizon, we actually are more constructive over that long term than we are tactically. So I will say, yes, we have to adjust our return expectation to reflect the cautious assessment of the macro environment, but there are value and we want to lean into that. We're conditioned by market history, Clinton, to believe that any five-year period should be a positive one, or at least it's likely to be one. Ray Dalio questioning that. Can you give me a final word on it? Yeah, I mean, I think everyone has to remember we're still dealing with the hangover from all the stimulus that was pumped to save the market and the economy from the pandemic. So we've had grave returns in 2020, 2021, and we're feeling some of those pains and we're paying back some of that now. And that was at once in a generation event, the pandemic, and all the stimulation that was pumped. So we're paying for that now, but if you look out three to five years, I believe in the U.S. economy. I believe in the U.S. corporations. I believe in the U.S. people. I believe in the U.S. consumer. And my optimism is that we will be up higher three to five years from now. We'll check in before we finish that five-year period. No doubt, Clinton. It's got to hear from you, sir. Clinton, Warren there, alongside Wei Lee. Clinton, Warren, JP Morgan Private Bank and Wei Lee, of course, of BlackRock. That line from Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, alongside David Weston.

I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan society is facing, namely, that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to redistribute income if you don't have much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Kishida government needs to redistribute.

A good morning four-day losing streak on ESMP 500. coming into today with down by another 6.10% right now on S&P 500 futures on the NASDAQ with down about 6.10% of 1%. We were much lower than this a little bit earlier in the session and that's because of what's always happening in the bond market. Take a look at bonds right now. Treasury yields off session highs briefly through 4%. But picking up again now at 4 basis points, 3.92.45. In the FX market in Euro, trying to show some strength, Euro dollar up a 10th of 1% 97.16. A crude negative 2.1% to 89.25. That's the cross asset price action that's getting some moveers. Here's Abby. Hey John, well between rising yields and US China tech tensions continuing to increase escalate. We of course have the tech rec continuing trips in particular. This is nothing new. We've seen this kind of action day after day between the pre-announcements and the Asian session after those fresh US curbs on China technology or the China's ability to gain access to US technology. We see big big declines in the Asian session Taiwan. So I conduct a plunge a record 8.3% right now down 4.8% here. The ADR and it is fearing sparking fears of retaliation. So you can see just again continued weakness Kale 10 core. The semi cap equipment company down about 4% sky work solution. The Apple supplier broad based declines here, John. Of course the socks closed at a fresh low yesterday for the years. Lois since November of 2020 now down 44%. The big question is what does this mean for the rest of the indexes chips, of course, a tell using everything that we use probably not the rosiest picture, John. Abby, thank you. We're down about a half of 1% on ESMP 500, one minute and about 30 seconds into the session. Pretty defensive stuff. The relative outperformance from Staples, healthcare utilities technology. Here's a line for you. The S&P 500 tech sector lagging the broader index this year by the most since 2002 with more than $4.50. The big question is, how is the best thing that you can do to help his title rig site, Sainta? That's not a good year that you want to be mentioning this while John when you mentioned technology. Let's dive into it. When you think about now the NASDAQ and the NASDAQ 100, the biggest of the big tech now down for five straight days. That is the longest losing streak matching it. Of this year set highlights of course some of the recent pressure is we've been continuing to track the path of the Federal Reserve and rates higher. Take a look and John, I think what was about the socks and the chip makers lately given the extra curves that the Biden administration has put on some of the chip makers and how they're doing business with China.

13604," It's also been software, so it's been hardware technology. It's really been all different facets and it hasn't sort of been that traditional software is recurring revenue and it's a potential safe haven. That narrative has changed and it's been a little bit more of a broad base sell off. Matt Meiley was out with a killer note this morning. If you take a look at where we are with the technicals highlighting the S&P as well as the NASDAQ 100 hitting some key technical levels, the NASDAQ here, just the general composite, also looking at some major support levels when you think about where you are for the lows of the year and trying to hold on to what has been at least some support levels as of late we'll be watching that into the closing bell. Looking forward to the coverage, Taylor, with you a little bit later, as always, this market's been hammered by rates this week we turn to earnings. James Athe of Aberdeen has this to say, I'm expecting more cautious and negative guidance on the basis of broad economic weakness and uncertainty and tighter monetary policy. Kelly Lites has more, hey, Kaylee. Hey, John, yeah, it doesn't sound great. We are just days away now from JP Morgan, unofficially kicking off the start of third quarter in earnings season. And the closer we have gotten to that, the more expectations have deteriorated. Back in mid-August, analysts were expecting on average earnings growth for S&P companies of about 4.3%. That estimate is now down at 2.6%. A significant slowdown compared to the 8.4%. We saw in Q2, for example, which by and large was a better than feared reporting season. The question is whether we'll see a repeat performance of that. If you look at the share of S&P members that have topped profit estimates, the trend has been a slow downward one. We have fewer companies beating expectations. And although JP Morgan is the unofficial start of earnings season, it's worth noting we've gotten 21 reports from S&P members already. And the average earnings surprise is negative 3.2%. So more companies are actually coming up short of the bar. It raises a question of whether the bar is still too high, which is what we've heard from a lot of voices here on Bloomberg TV. We've got a lot of research on the cell side, says that essentially we have seen downward earning revisions. That is true. That is what we're looking here on this chart, not just the U.S., but globally. It's about 17 weeks in a row here in the U.S. that downward revisions have outpaced upward one. But the narrative is that we still have farther to go. That you need to see more deterioration in expectations of these companies face so many headwinds, including the stronger dollar, tighter monetary policy, and just a slowing growth environment that could hit demand and the ability to pass on higher input costs that remain strong. Kelly, thank you. Building on what Kelly just said there, what we get the kitchen sink this earnings season in the guidance. Mike Wilson and Morgan Stanley says this, markets often need the engraved invitation from a higher power to tell them what's going on. For bond markets, it's the Fed and for stocks, it's company management teams. Mike Wilson, I'm pleased to say, joined us right now. Hey, Mike, do we get the kitchen sink then from management teams this earnings season? Well, like this is the question, we don't know the answer to, right? We think we know the answer to where earnings are going. We've done a lot of work on that. That's where we have the highest conviction. I think that's where most out of consensus is that 2023 will disappoint. But of course, for markets, the path in which you get there is always the question. And we think that there's plenty of evidence from a top-down perspective to do our analysis to say, hey, why don't we just cut the numbers? But as we said in this week's note, somewhat jokingly, but this is the way it works. The numbers are sticky until companies throw in the towel. People say, well, what's the consensus earnings for next year? Basically, what they're saying is, what is the company management team guidance for next year? And they haven't really given us guidance. So that's why the numbers are always stale until they're forced to make those cuts. And so this is a time of year where companies can decide to kitchen sink it. As I said in the note, where they just throw in the towel, they cut costs in a lower to bar, or they wait until January when they have to give formal guidance for the full year for next year. So it's between here and there. I guess you'll get some of it now. I mean, we're seeing at the individual stock level where he's seeing that, as Kayleigh was saying, we're seeing some pretty bad earnings already from those who have reported, and they've thrown in the towel. So it's going to be a mixed bag. So we're seeing some of our confidence on where we're going is high or confidence on the path as well. Mike, just going to have that line again. For bond markets, it's the Fed and for stocks, it's company management teams. Does that imply that you and the team believe there is a part of this market, there is further along in the adjustment process? Absolutely. And particularly for bonds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1830,2022-10-11 13:39:06
13605," Does that imply that you and the team believe there is a part of this market, there is further a longer than the adjustment process? Absolutely. And, you know, particularly for bonds, right? So I would say a year ago, the most mispriced market was the bond market. And that's why stocks overshot to the upside because rates were artificially too low. And we find it somewhat amusing, you know, fixed income investors. And in particular, are the most critical of the Fed, that at least that's what we hear, yet they hang on every word. So which is it? Do you don't think they're credible or you think they're so credible that you have to trade off of their every word? So it's really this weird dynamic. And I would say that, you know, bond markets have been chasing the Fed all year. The Fed has done their job. They've, you know, aggressively pivoted to a very hawkish regime, even more hawkish than we expected, but at the end of last year, we were probably one of the more negative folks in the bond market. So, you know, I think the bond market is probably there. And but unfortunately, kind of like stocks, the bond market used to be told by the Fed that they're done, right? And this is the dance we're in right now. It's the hardest part of the cycle of the trade. We think we know we're going in equities. We think yields are probably close to topping. But we got to go through the earnings revision still, which is why you can't say that stocks at bonds. But we talk about margins then. One thing the bond market has been pricing over the last several months is the prospect of inflation rolling over in our future. Now, I think what matters to margins and Mike, you've written about this a million times, is the pocket of the inflation story, the sticks and the pocket of it that fades. When you think about what's going to fade here, Mike, from an inflation perspective and what's going to stick, what does it mean for margins? Yeah, that's exactly right. So we were to pretty detailed note this week in addition to our weekly around inventory where we worked collectively with our analysts teams. And I mean, like this has been a story that we've been talking about for nine months. We said that it's likely that the bottlenecks get relieved and then we'll see too much inventory. And I think where that's most evident is in some of the apparel stocks or retailers where consumer goods kind of cross the board. And it's likely that we're going to see outright deflation in a lot of those products as companies have to discount to move the extra product. I think area is where it's going to be tougher to get negative prices, it's going to be in say, housing and rents, at least on a year of a sequential basis, but maybe on a year of a year, basically, we can get them to flat. And then of course, labor. Labor now does have the upper hand a bit because of the pandemic. And I think we moved into a different regime here where we're seeing a shift from capital to labor. So I don't think you're going to see labor costs come down. You may see them flatten out, but that could be one of the more defining features of this cycle, John, that actually makes margins worse. And what I mean by that is, you know, US based companies are very good at cutting costs when they need to, and particularly labor costs. And because of the pandemic and the shortage of labor that may be here for a while, companies may not be in a position to do that as a vessel is they have historically. And that's the case. And we probably see more margin degradation than even when we're modeling. And I'll just leave you with this. I think that the area of the market that a lot of clients are perhaps underestimating is negative operating leverage. Inflation increases operating leverage. However, operating leverage can cut both ways. It was positive in the lockdown during the pandemic. And now it's in a negative cycle. And we think that's where even we can be underestimating the downside to market pressure because that negative operating leverage story and labor is part of that. And I think that is a very different market regime than what we've experienced recently in years before as well. What does that mean for leadership within the equity market, Mike? What does it come from? Yeah, well, it continues more the same of what we've been saying all year, John, and you know this well, which is we're very focused on companies ahead of what we call operational efficiency. They have their hands on cost, working capital is not feeding up the cash flows, another feature what we're seeing right now. They're very good at running their businesses. And that's a video sync, credit features. That's not a sector feature per se. Now some sectors that can defend their margin position or operational efficiency better. Those tend to be the more defensive areas, really health care is an example of some of the managed care businesses look quite good in that regard to what it treated well. I would say clearly some in staples and beverages, you know, that's where we are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1831,2022-10-11 13:43:31
13606," Some of the managed care businesses look quite good in that regard to what it treated well. I would say clearly someone staples and beverages, but that's where we are. And then of course when we get to the trough, you're going to want to flip it exactly the other direction because we're not in the camp. I think you were saying a minute ago, we're going to have negative returns or flat returns for the next five years. That could be true point to point, depending on a real basis after inflation. But there's going to be tremendous trading opportunities on the upside, just like there was in 2021. However, we're still in the down cycle right now. So we were thinking about the next five years down, which is probably different than most is we're in this boom bus period. And we're in a bus period right now. We'll get through it and there's going to be another boom. So as soon as you get your head around on the bus, it's probably time to start thinking about the upside. And that could be within the next three to five months. Well Mike, this is the perfect time to have this conversation then because right now on my screen, we're making new lows for the year, the new low for the year, 3582 on ESMP 500. Are you saying in the next few months, Mike, you could change course? And I think we should build on that a little bit more because the risk as always as you know is to become married to a world view. Super bearish, come married to the position. You can't make the turns come back into the market. Mike, I know that you haven't done that over the last couple of years. You were super bullish out of the pandemic and then you turned. What's going to make you turn, Mike? What's going to make you that little bit more bullish to have that rip that you're looking for? Well, the same thing we did in 2020 or there we did in 2017, you know, when we found ourselves out of consensus, it's, you know, you're really our sold out. We could argue we are now. But then our fundamental metrics are telling us that we're at a rate of change low. So we've been, we're pretty disciplined around that. We don't get everything right. But one thing we tend to not, we tend to be early. We're usually not late. Of course, right now being early to be quite painful. But I don't want to get too bullish here because people then will get through my words and say, hey, you know, here is time to go. And that's not what we're saying. We're saying there's still, you know, last couple of days this bear market could be quite painful. Okay. But you got to be ready for when that price gets to an attractive level. If it was 5% away, John, I would say fine. But we still think, you know, kind of low 3000s, even 3000 is really where we're probably going. You know, as we go through 3400, 3300, kind of towards a low 3000s, we've heard other people kind of throw those numbers out too, kind of nonchalantly. It's like, that's a big move, you know, I mean, you know, so you don't want to be too early in sort of getting, getting your head around that. But the things we're looking for the most is rate of change on earnings growth and revisions. Baguuation can be the other way we get there, which is how we got there during the pandemic. You know, equity risk permeate really blows out. And then of course, we'll, we'll start to see the other whites of the eyes in terms of seeing economic growth, which will pit, which will actually cause a better pivot. They're not there yet. Okay, so there, those are three things that we're very focused on. And it's just that the cake is just not baked yet. We're going to talk to you before that cake gets baked. I'm sure might thank you, sir. As always, might loosen there from more constantly on this equity market. We're down for a fifth straight session on ESMP.

My grandfather got into the mutual fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the mutual fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today, we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public. And so in 2000, the average company went public after three years. Now, companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact, there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investable universe, you look at the private markets and it's significantly bigger. So the question is, that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly, the democratization of the private markets to the retail investors. And I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it into the average investor. For a young person who now booking in a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today?

On the markets on this story, picking things up now is Lisa. Hey, Lisa. Hey, John. Thanks so much. We are right now speaking with someone who has a real feeling and entrenched in the economic fibers of particularly smaller and mid sized companies, Lawrence Gallup, CEO of Gallup Capital adjoining us here in Greenwich, Connecticut from the Greenwich Economic Forum. And I'm curious from your standpoint, with a credit focus on smaller companies as you hear about all of the fear in markets. Are you getting more aggressive or less aggressive in your investments? Well, thanks, Lisa. It's great to be here with you. Right now is an increasingly good time in our business. But lending business is cyclical. You want to lend not against the frothy top of performance. And you want to lend not at the most extremely high leverage levels. You want to lend money when companies that are borrowing the money can put it to excellent use. And the economy right now really is pretty good. You can't have a bad economy and 3.5% unemployment. Interest rate sensitive sectors, which are not where we really invest or having some struggles. But we're trying to be especially active problem solving for our private equity firm clients, especially as they have portfolio companies that are growing by acquisition. And I was speaking about this with Jim Zelger. The complication comes when you're lending for five years. At a time when the economy is moving very quickly. And I'm wondering from your perspective, whether that duration has shrunk, whether you're less willing to invest for a longer period of time, as the ambiguity of perhaps 3.5% unemployment now could turn into something vastly different a year or two from now. But it's all about margin of safety. It's about margin of safety in terms of how high confloting rates rise before you have interest coverage problems. It's about how many mistakes a management team can make or how many unlucky things can happen. We certainly don't know what inflation is going to be for years. We need something.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1833,2022-10-11 13:52:06
13608," It's about how many mistakes a management team can make or how many unlucky things can happen. We certainly don't know what inflation is going to be for years. From now we run all the models, we do sensitivities. The margin of safety in loans we make today given the wider range of possible outcomes, we try to make bigger than we would in some other times. That margin of safety, of course, a lender's margin of safety is a bar or is problem potentially, so there's always given take. Well that's exactly what I was going to actually ask, how high are yields? I mean if you're looking at public markets with 10% average yields for speculative grade credit, how are yields in private markets? So a typical loan that we would, a new loan that we would make now, would have an interest rate margin of so for plus 6.5%. So for on a forward curve, it's going to be 4.4 and a half percent next year. So you're talking about an 11% floating rate yield in our asset class, which is super attractive because it's firstly senior secured and floating rate. So for goes to 5.5, that 11 goes to 12. So you have built-in protection against inflation. The private credit markets are pretty attractive on a risk adjusted return basis right now. You raise the issue of if yields go too high, it becomes a problem for the borrower, which is a reason why when yields go way too high, it can become a problem. Based on what you're seeing, just in the nuts and bolts, and then you put out a mid-marker report, you start to look and strip away the large story lines and actually look at the details. How well or how not well are companies doing in this very quickly moving cycle? We're seeing greater dispersion. We're seeing greater dispersion between industries. We're seeing greater dispersion among companies within industries. I think one of the things that our business is based on is lending to private equity back businesses, which helps a little bit because private equity firms are very good at noticing issues and intervening in issues. But for sure, as so-for-approaches 4.5%, there's less room to maneuver, especially if a company has borrowed a very high multiple of a justity but done. Not all those adjustments have come to pass, and all of a sudden they're looking at an 11% interest rate on what was 6 or 7 times adjusted, but it might be 8 times really, but, unfortunately, this is when your skill as a credit underwriter comes into play. You don't want to have made those laws. Are there certain areas you will not touch right now because the industry is just flat on its back in a way that people might not appreciate? So we really stay away from businesses that rely on consumer case and consumer preferences. So, for example, we do a lot of mission-critical business to business software, but we won't do business to consumer software. And there are parts of business to consumer software. They're booming. They're at some that if you know, hit some bumps, we're just not smart enough to pick the winners and losers. And back to the five years, even if we were smart enough to pick winners and losers, we're not smart enough to pick five years worth. For other industries, where traditionally you have liked them occasionally, but have seen deterioration that is so dramatic that it has you concerned. Well, specialty retailers who are ball-based businesses that have very high demands on lower skilled labor content. We would have, for example, probably considered alone to a franchise or who had a lot of operations in California. With California's minimum wage increases, you got to worry about the health of the franchisees. So something like that, we'd be more conservative about right now. And what are you concerned about going forward in terms of this default cycle? Right? I mean, a lot of people talk about where we are, where are we in terms of the repricing let alone companies actually running into trouble? So, we're expecting muddling growth. If we have muddling growth, we're not going to have a massive default cycle like we did in the financial crisis. I think what we're looking at are companies specific issues where the early intervention can really make a big difference. By figuring out, do they need more capital? Should the company be sold to an industry player? I think that we have to keep our eye on inflation because inflation correlates with what Sofers is going to be in the future. I mean, we're all very concerned about interest rates going up, but Sofers still negative in real terms. If you look historically...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1834,2022-10-11 13:56:14
13609," Sofer is going to be in the future. I mean, we're all very concerned about interest rates going up, but sofer is still negative in real terms. If you look historically at Fed funds, the historical average of Fed funds before the financial crisis was 5%, we're not even up to average yet. You said that you work with a lot of companies that are private equity back to those that are not. Do you find that they have a harder time getting equity investments and are turning to debt more frequently that you're getting better terms than you're having better claim on a company simply because private equity perhaps is in that much more of a world of hurt. I wish, but not the case. Private equity bars are so tough and smart. They don't let us get away with anything. We have great relationships, only done multiple deals with over 200 private equity firms, but they're looking for a reliable partner who helps the portfolio companies grow. They're not given anything away. And private equity firms don't have a shortage of debt capital. I think one of the interesting trends that we'll play out over the next 12 months is the pace of new deals by private equity firms. Right now, the S&P is approaching new session lows. We are seeing the sell off, accelerate as yields continue to climb. At what point will you move away from floating rate loans and start to want to have fixed rate instruments again? We won't. We're in the floating rate business. We match fund. We take the inflation issue. We take the interest rate risk off the table as traditional senior secured landers. So we won't do that. I think that the degree to which we take some junior capital risk, whether that's floating rate or fixed rate, is a little bit cyclical. And to us, that's less about what interest rates are doing and more about our own thinking about forward profit growth. In our middle market report, we had very robust growth in revenue, but the growth in profit was really not that great. And now it's comparing to a year ago, which were boom times, but we're having an economy now where the economy is growing. GDP is growing. Interest rates are going up, but it's getting harder and harder to achieve profit growth. Yeah, another way of saying margin, compression, Lawrence Gallup, thank you so much of Gallup capital. John, back to you. Hey, Lisa, thank you. Great work this morning. Thank you very much. New lows for 2022, on the S&P 535, 78. Just off those lows right now, the S&P down by 910th of 1%.

Wall Street prepares for the latest read on inflation. The state will take fat, peak or kishness, we're getting carried away. The market's been right. Our rate hike starting to pay off. How long is it going to take to see progress on inflation? That just has a long way to go. Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. Inflation is still stick to US economy is still on track. And what it means for the Fed? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll. This is a fact that will blame the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday. Bloomberg. Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mace. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I won! Look for the winning number in Thai Thai for every day. I'll find TV, video, and newspapers. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. A million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away. All of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. They had a huge...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1836,2022-10-11 14:04:50
13611," the relation of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employers winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and the Garbled Facts had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile, causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news, they announced the latest winning number, 3, 4, 9. The problem was 3, 4, 9 had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with 3, 4, 9. Just floating around the Philippines, hundreds of thousands of people, all across the Philippines, thousands of islands, were finding winning bottle caps, 3, 4, 9, 3, 4, 9. Some people had 10 lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps. People were dancing in the streets, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 3, 4, 9 bottle caps, but we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Raul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. And Raul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. And he was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. And when I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1837,2022-10-11 14:09:07
13612, and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants in order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but help us out that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines not in America. Back in the Philippines Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrant's handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrant were ever upheld but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for the fight and another heating for the branch one thirteen eight also three times a month. Also there was a time my father's was hospital. Jew do heart failure. Still he had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to the president of the president of the father. My father passed away January 13th when they then after staying for almost one year in the hospital he died of complications due to heart failure. After the death of my father I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to there.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1838,2022-10-11 14:13:11
13613," They didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to their documents about this, but they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened, and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those good world payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped, they were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. You should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered mine at the attack was actually sitting in the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhine, Westphalia and it's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well at Dortmund.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1839,2022-10-11 14:17:32
13614," High prices they thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like by Unmutic. Unfortunately that didn't go too well, Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares, it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund, everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in the hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before games so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic they had a chance to go really far maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in a pub. As always the fans are very excited about matches. On that day they were heading to play in the quarter final against AS Monaco at Signal Uduna Stadium which is in the centre of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. A fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadis were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe there was widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right Wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism. One of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing a man in Austria named Rudolf who was a big BBB fan he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain day. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something isn't right here. The person to make money off of that is required.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1840,2022-10-11 14:22:07
13615," Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something, something, something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus, carrying the Borussia Dortmund for bollars on April 11th, written notes left at the scene, claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubingen. It was on its way to work, and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect, because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W, stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris, and he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down, and he believed that if an attack took place, that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borussia Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, the successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Saga Yvenigolud, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Yvenigolud had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Venergold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Venergold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and T threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Venergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1841,2022-10-11 14:26:29
13616," if she leaves him. Vaynergold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Vaynergold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately Vaynergold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threat to an asteroid hitting earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. And according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The reason is to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence is outstakes. Right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about say a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäke-Levy-9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1842,2022-10-11 14:31:07
13617," In 1994, Stargazers watched as comet Schumäger levy 9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, 1km wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large 1km near Earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. We call these near Earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near Earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Cmon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1843,2022-10-11 14:35:11
13618," that parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly there. And then Cmon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from our surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of, a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And that they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time. For let's say a thousand years. And then you launch asteroids from the surface. As if they, if you go forward in time, would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today. And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare this all the other asteroids in the in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex. And if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. And therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends on the way it is. It's a great deal on what we know about it. And how much time we have before the encounter. We really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion is to have options of the level you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility. And that's kind of in a way sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with, you know, a massive object, a spacecraft. So it's kind of like bowling if you will. You know, if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer though. And you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft. And obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated. And they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting a pressure of light sort of perturbates. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that survey the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors. And also, we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impact we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years, 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger I think comes from your case. We don't know about this and not from your case.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1844,2022-10-11 14:39:36
13619," Let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years. Most of them we haven't seen coming. So the danger, the real danger, I think comes from your objects we don't know about. And not from your objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem of the global comments. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem. And nobody takes our worship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. The kind of imagine in the future, maybe he locks a small satellite around the Earth that we're always going and looking outward. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. It's our existence as stake, right? The pandemic has affected everyone in the world. The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my letsses in. But for millions of others, I'm going to be posting stocks that will boom. They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Let's just lock it on up and take $50,000. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it. And I just watch it until it stops going up. And then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailer GameStop has set to continue their headspinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York in Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok vincluencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. I'm not sure if I'm right. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robin Hood, the online brokerage app, talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robin Hood has, which is to democratize investing. Robin Hood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley, as an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1845,2022-10-11 14:43:38
13620, in where else Silicon Valley as an alternative to the big brokerages but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets they could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10-15 years ago but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robin Hood think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading the customers Robin Hood was courting have been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab for example is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robin Hood. Even today with all of its popularity the median account size is about $240. There's fidelities in the Schwabs in the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose if those kind of accounts are. I don't want a thousand dollar account to just the headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here right because the thing about Robin Hood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robin Hood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well sized the shapes the colors all of that is something that the founders of Robin Hood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019 they had about ten million customers. Those ten million customers were a huge success story for Robin Hood but no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts they have more than 20 million customers which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies breakout successes. Robin Hood traders as they're called became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning they go on Robin Hood. They're in the shower they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school. You know checking their phones in between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1846,2022-10-11 14:47:46
13621," as their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations, is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18. And by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm gonna have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives for needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other have been around for 100 years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's as far as 2021. That's being done on the internet. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwist and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too larger. As social media has played a bigger partner lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. Soon, may the women come to bring a sugar and tea and rum. People aren't just going to it for C-shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you just understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbride and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluenters. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like, there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about. And it's gatecap behind the industry. And so people want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Rift Cluster. I have been trading since high school, and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for stock, you can just go up. It's a call. So think of it like this. I made the options video where I was like, options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at said price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video. And we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor. Or like, I could sit and listen to you all day.

How do you catch some of the pension in less than 60 seconds and how do you make it something that they're like I need this in my life nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds But the people who perfect it are the people that you're gonna watch and get to stick around And where people are sticking around Reddit and it's nearly countless subreddits about finance And And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the Social media platform for finance places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down Started in January 2012 It wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan like etiquette leading to their tagline like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for wide stock xyz jump 20% in a day And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of You know squared the circle so to speak and and start making sense and it was at that point that it was like wow We have to start paying attention to this Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others were just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of Fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money Then on top of all of that there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat to live But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market And it's not just stock tips people quote unquote yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock They post what is called gain and loss port screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see I am about to lose everything And while some of the people on Wall Street Bets are novice investors the community contains multitudes In one respect what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people and this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021 It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps And more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way I What came together is game stop Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with game stop a couple of years ago on the boards like reddit and stock twist a lot of people We're talking about game stop as being attractive value some of them are even you know Wall Street alums who who left the industry and now still have access to tool is that they can use To improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions and I think roaring kitty is a perfect example of that Game stop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today Really I don't understand hey can disagree with that at the same time That this crowd was talking it up the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like this stock at all And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020 Sure it selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept An investor borrows a stock and then sells it the investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are And that can range anywhere from an",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1848,2022-10-11 14:56:36
13623," Act as a policeman in financial markets, or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers! Everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying, keep going. And it was working too. Until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls of institution, artist-powered, full as maybe the institution slept them to be eaten. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic. On hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations.

13624," A choice or by force that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in, whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it, it's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up. So it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, get...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1850,2022-10-11 15:05:22
13625," So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit's service, which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical, is running it about 119 a month through 130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme chanting. Singing. And marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home, but please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America, like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She earned her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin at the list area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low income African American students, Latino students and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of CONCAST, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1851,2022-10-11 15:09:55
13626," It's just not cost effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March, and signed by President Donald Trump, awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least, as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but there is a city that was economically in a downturn. In the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. So, I think it's a big challenge. I think it's a big challenge. I think it's a big challenge. One two, one two, one two, five, six, eight, seven, eight. Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dalits. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you are born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. I think education is the best way of liberating them. So, that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, source of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1852,2022-10-11 15:14:08
13627," He is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, a source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Pravine Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langan or social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized, but talented and then poor. My friends also are for this. Up to 60% are girls and then 40% are boys, because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, stay in the schools, and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating, and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting. And what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium, because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation, and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So, we had to train a lot of teachers. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of a very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past, I am not saying that, but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So, the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So, that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero, I aim to be a top notch engineer, I am a Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero, I want to be a very good actor or musician in this world. So, these are the positive images that are associated with identity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1853,2022-10-11 15:18:16
13628," So, these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. Just to give an example to you. See, in 2012, in our institutions, we used to produce about 6 doctors per year. But because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people. You know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So, but today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, food. Pujita has been a form-lebror. And the parents, the angels are agricultural labourers. And then this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year, despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Ustman and Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We've got a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, our Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy. So we have, you know, Kabadi, that traditional Indian sport. We have gold. And then, it is the gold falls, like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. Wow. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees, you know, type of opportunities to the students. So, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Make the fence at least mentally because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country. To put it in one word, the soul aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are closely involved on these people. Their stereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostels, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. When I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusive to mental health and social health. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day night and lesson.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1854,2022-10-11 15:22:41
13629," That's where exclusive element for shoulder costs and shoulder drives. We used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again, you know, try to excel in academics day in and day out. So that's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really, you know, place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future, this is going to be a game changer for the marginalised in this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore, which is basically a concrete jungle, urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park, and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1855,2022-10-11 15:26:48
13630," from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators, for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people and today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban heat island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades. That's why Cooling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate the urban heat island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You cannot at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1856,2022-10-11 15:31:09
13631," a limited option, but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin, or duct, that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combine this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. Times like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know, I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing. Like any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being like real money and then it started coming in more and more and then it was like I hit my first day that I broke a grant and I was like, this is actually gonna be money.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1857,2022-10-11 15:35:25
13632," money and then it started coming in more and more and then it would like I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like This is actually gonna be money How did the YouTube channel come to be when the game Pokemon? Sun and Moon came out for the 3ds There was like things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people and At the time I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing and That video got six views and then two days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I Just started pumping out more and more content and people were like this guy knows what he's talking about It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like My channel really focuses on tips and tricks so I Play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark and then I'll make my first video While I'm going through I've a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things It stumped me so I know the things that may stump other people What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One you need to do something that you're passionate about Not that you like not that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about This other thing is something that other people are passionate about it holds a special place to them And third is it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on In order to enter into the marketplace you either need to be better than everyone else You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works Which is very similar to Google Analytics then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a youtuber kind of breaks down to three different ways one Which is the bulk of it which is ad revenue Whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner And then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or The video starts immediately you get the little banner ads at the bottom or If you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount it varies on Lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it The time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with A reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising So because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and That means that for every one thousand views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views. I made 30 cents But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content Some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars And there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February That's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos In that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content that instead? You're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher The second way that a YouTuber makes Income is support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off Patreon was really the only option But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get a special Icon's next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1858,2022-10-11 15:40:02
13633," Constex to your name, I believe they're called badges or on any video you can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the Third aspect of that would be merch and For me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod bands you You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself if you're not loving what you do then it's not worth it Huh, so make a channel about something that I'm passionate about oh sweet I guess I can make the channel about that Now how do I grow an audience? Do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following you have to have a massive Instagram following you have to have a massive YouTube Following of course you have to be on twitch, which is the key platform, but Basically anyway you can get in front of your audience you can engage with your audience It's going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them They're not just people who are good at games They're actually people who are good at online engagement online entertainment first and foremost You have to write to remain stylish anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion The streamer is either very very talented at the game the best player in the game is Generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good on the other hand They're either very very good or funny Charismatic whatever it is on that side. Oh You know it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a back drop in an excuse to Engage with our audience. There were those weird like Ronald McDonald looks straight to VHS movies remember those I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of you know when boring things were happening the game I would ramble on about you know movies. I'd watched or books. I'd read and you know or conversations I'd had and stuff like that And so I think being personable was a big part of that It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword and every gym has Okay, he's dead to have a larger audience and to have that audience. I think stay with you You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back And you got to make it a little more exciting. All right, throw on a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment I think the real most important thing is is to just get used to being on camera like in any sort of performance thing It's get used to talking on camera You know, I this my first few videos were terrible But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money Make a job out of it have all this growth and it's gonna be great You're probably gonna burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time Right like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff and so you know those first few times You're streaming nobody is there one person shows up every 30 minutes says hi maybe and leaves right like it's very discouraging I think for a lot of people and so you have to be there just loving it You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1859,2022-10-11 15:44:16
13634," uh... discouraging, I think, for a lot of people and so you have to be there just loving it, you have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around, you have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it and there you have it! my very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord and streaming channels all ready to go live it's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my patreon for perks also go to my merch page and one last thing stay cool my friends this is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like via and by the products they recommend on e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In the sister app of TikTok it's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun you gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action it's almost like a theatre act the internet craze has taken over China by the end of 2020 the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020 it's becoming popular outside China as well so it's live streaming the future of shopping live streaming is not a new thing and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G and it was first used for entertainment and socializing many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts in the west live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers and China is broken into e-commerce China actually has a very big e-commerce empire so it uses these super apps what we call that you have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers so with this advantage they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods here is a perfect choice nice neutral beautiful print nothing overwhelming and the warmth and comfort of flannel this is I don't know traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction whereby a host introduces a product demonstrates some things and say call this number or something but live stream shopping is live that in itself is a very very big difference it causes different psychology and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else when you shop actually this live streaming video will continue it will minimize into a corner and you can like buy the items",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1860,2022-10-11 15:48:26

One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even, for once, so they rocky launch in her livestreaming room for 40 million yuan. The king was Li Jiaqi, more widely known as lipstick brother. She used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into a livestreaming commers. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top livestreamers like Viya and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-breaking livestreamers like Tiffany, you're in a good income through sales commissions. If you like it, you can buy it. That's the reason why she was born. And that's what I mean. Because we have so many new products. To him, there's an honest opinion. Some people want to hear that. And they seem very credible. They seem trustworthy. They're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Li Jiaqi, you want a generous record for the most lipstick applications to models in a 30 seconds. If you're able to create a lot of abs, you can think of interesting things. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. and sell new central manager to the company as well. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things because you see it live. Something because social proof has taken over meaning that hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and they ask questions and they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have local governments in small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell.

13637," Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpit project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design, and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after diver Rano Koeiversari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate, and that rotation extends deep down below the surface, and the waves can be very long. They can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy, eventually back to the pause that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller. A 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel, fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry, in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that kind of tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in the American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1863,2022-10-11 16:04:00
13638," I'm off to my office, I'm off to my situation, with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. So that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetties and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies. Because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables. We install on existent man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders, which transmit by the great of a fluid into land located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of upcoming storms, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today, as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe in the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at sea on gas-decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So, we need all renewable energy sources to work together, and for a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1864,2022-10-11 16:08:20
13639," MUSIC I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies, where you know, people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale of Nissan. He is making you know what we like on this side. I mean, you know, it's a problem. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared me. You scared my children. I love these into 16 years. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council. The highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carles Goe. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carliscom. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Rivendor Passe. I am the former global general council of Nissan Motorco Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carles Goe saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carles Goe was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carles Goe. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Reno and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Reno and Japan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1865,2022-10-11 16:12:51
13640," think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays and one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company and even in the government there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting and he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whistled him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company and somewhere along the way it was criminalized. By that I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts might have been a board action might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office and that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto. So after Carlos Gone was arrested Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Posse was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone and he was told get to the heart of the matter find out what Carlos Done did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah it's really complicated because you had various things coming out into weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer, he's originally Malaysian. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Gone and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harry Nader was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a long standing relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nader had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing and it just didn't smell right, this doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1866,2022-10-11 16:16:51
13641," some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right, just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gown. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors, about these conflicts, discussions with HR, about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. At the time, everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested, a representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights, and they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Passe makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has, and great detail, backed up by evidence, backed up by memos, of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again, with hindsight.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1867,2022-10-11 16:21:17
13642," to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore and up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to Vice President at the global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and the harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his day in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. Chewing that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice this was a round mid-march and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going but this grave and small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And, you know, given we'd seen, right seen the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling. I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on here? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama to basically do a search end of his home and seizure of his, you know, corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1868,2022-10-11 16:25:42
13643," to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain misunderstandings were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again, I just couldn't understand on what is the point of doing that. This is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. If a confidential company email, right, you should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you gotta be ready for that. You gotta be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. THE You This is the awful truth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1869,2022-10-11 16:29:56
13644," This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera to me. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seen to sort of rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the shot in steam family and asked whether or not I was. I would be interested in writing about Beverly shot in steam. In this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. I included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the shot in steam kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire state. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences. It was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the rise or didn't know about. I was becoming very very suspicious. I was starting to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They went to the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took all.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1870,2022-10-11 16:34:24
13645," And then they went in the drawers in the office and took all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Don, I'm gonna write my feelings in this black book. And it's a diary and she started writing each day. She would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived. The FedEx package. And in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Don and some other family members take a look at this. And they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of a $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back. But she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi. And in there, she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son, Bobby, had the key to that box. And that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten, a memento will and trust. There's such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened? There have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity under account. And it ended up setting off a fire storm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day Beverly's in her her place. The granddaughter's still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating them. And he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper. And she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed. The phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were gonna have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh it was terrible. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities usually known as Finra. It took several months to hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. You know, over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Ovi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1871,2022-10-11 16:38:53
13646," Entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves, and they also found that the bank and her grandson Evan reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about $19 million. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter, said his sons weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of, you know, kind of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused, you know, those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep, you know, hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders, led by a guy called Cuddles, made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well, hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts of play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something, the breached market rules in a bid to push the market and that investigation is ongoing?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1872,2022-10-11 16:43:05
13647," In a bid to push the market and that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys. He became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three amongst you know in amongst that was very successful and made you know very large amounts of money as a young man. But you know inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked their lots of their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions. Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their 20s and they're he's you know drinking buddies son or their his own kids friends from football. You know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent. Let's be clear but they're all part of his collective. Yeah I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex so I feel like I'm free to you know to get into it. Wait as they say. If you want to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent a guy which he's starting accent. You know not afraid to splash the cash but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense does he? But you know these guys they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves they went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Fade and boys is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheob ride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know anyone that covers markets it's going to be surprised about that. You know you're thinking your BPs of the world or your Glencores but it's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together they played golf together they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1873,2022-10-11 16:47:36
13648, was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of this was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money so if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts and it's basically a contract that says I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future it's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil was going to go up or down on the 20th of April in Essex there had been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading in the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave the oil to the oil market and they were going to be able to buy a new oil market and they were going to be able to buy a new oil market essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230 p.m so they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day but they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for and of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped so this is going very well for them you know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day now once it gets to kind of 130 to p.m that's when things start to get really interesting suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up now 208 p.m exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars we've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy that huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for and able them to make more money than they ever thought possible so their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold the price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel for one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day it's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading no one could have predicted it I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade you get paid on both sides you get paid both to sell and to buy it you know it's unthinkable one thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk yeah we spoke to oil traders both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is you know incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this they simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles and his friends were so when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each one of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties one of them was 22 years old you know in a few years earlier he'd been posted on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is a few years later making a one hundred million dollars in a single days trading when me and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it we couldn't believe what we were seeing all trading is a zero-sum game anytime you're making money as an oil trade as someone else is losing it amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund crude oil treasure fund there were thousands of them and they lost everything lots of people have put their savings into oil funds they lost money that day big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties they lost money that day and another interesting thing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1874,2022-10-11 16:51:56
13649," People have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q8, potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable they would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or $10 million, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. And the law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately. And they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. A Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well at in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had is kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments, if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fine. You could be banned from trading and, you know, in most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. You know, one obvious one is going to be, they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that, you know, they'll go down as legends. It's very important given that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1875,2022-10-11 16:56:11
13650," It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now, they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that, you know, we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that it's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December, and then on the 27th. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost effectively. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims, and as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the nature.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1876,2022-10-11 17:00:26
13651," that a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years. And they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter. But they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out. But others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work. And we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI, the 70th Disney World this year. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints. But it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now, fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears their drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1877,2022-10-11 17:04:50
13652," that is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the nature conservancy defends vigorously these deals and they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So some would also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story including Disney, they didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that look we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange it's called the American carbon registry. Now it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules but there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent you have policy makers but but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the incentive to really participate hard make a lot of things happen and the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low-cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions and so the policies end up biasing the whole system and and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. You know when it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can but you know if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change then it's nothing but a distraction and you know after 30 years you have to start wondering is it really just a distraction and that's really unfortunate but that's where we are. Ultimately what needs to be what needs to happen is systemic change you know we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know we we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change it's sort of trying to stick your your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system and and at the end of the day that can't really work.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1878,2022-10-11 17:09:06
13653," You The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop is a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. This is a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobile and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight, no way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. The Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1879,2022-10-11 17:13:29
13654," Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about a 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. To drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Lucia, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. And the number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? To convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology, there's no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperlubes will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbiltz of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Invisiting the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. And so these 500, sale tunnel,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1880,2022-10-11 17:18:07
13655," Well, and outside of China, South Korea and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government level business case for 300 kmh conventional high speed rail, 500 kmh Maglev and 1000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloups will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1881,2022-10-11 17:22:05
13656," to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop Network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hybrid test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network. That is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. The track is divergity from one track into two. That makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end we'll make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up, and whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects. Do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system? So it's about all these different aspects. And the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant. And that they need to contribute to bring this to market. To get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1882,2022-10-11 17:26:32
13657," with other hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies run Europe, create the first commercial hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project that's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Hart's next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperlip route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright brothers refers, but none of us fly on Wright brothers' airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around, we'll continue to be at the forefront of building Hyperlip. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive.

13658," Music This week, how hydrogen can transform. Our energy usage. We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. The high-tech action is practical, it's implementable, it's to it now. Plus the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm Snam about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossacks are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lymes and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War 2 Hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility company Snam about his book The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen. The most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Other methods is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1884,2022-10-11 17:35:46
13659," is to use electricity to split water molecules although there is no carbon byproduct, and if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, power by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipping. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fordescue metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laqua caught up with Twiggy Forrest. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other hydrogen, any other agridist, look in there and say, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the online. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it two days ago when JCP, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCP. And Fortescue, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record. It went from Superwell from Fortescue, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom, right, then that's a real wake up call to say hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel, you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And on a greenhagen zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1885,2022-10-11 17:39:37
13660," and you know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only green hydrogen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out coal. If you look at the G20 company cave, so we have a long way to go to talk about only using green hydrogen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more coal-fired power stations, coal mining projects. Ever wish you'd wind them down as quickly as possible, because they are cooking the planet just like grey and green hydrogen, it's cooking the planet. Yeah, you know, hydrogen to not matter in your electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse, than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of green hydrogen. So why are leaders so slow? Even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20, because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on green hydrogen, but that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel has now been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none, that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously that green hydrogen is never here to stay. It's broken through. History has been made. It will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding. You stop subsidizing. You stop using money into possibly. Right. It could be carbon sequestration. It could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed. While we ashed the planet on fossil fuel subsidies, because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen. It could have been pushed down. It's down its ore source excuses are never be commercial. They never be supplied to the quantities we needed. Now, blah, blah. Now we know it. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. OK, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition, just going from 8 to beat? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. 8 to beat is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their ore, burn their gas. At least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest to say, don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done, honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. OK, it's there. When you have the power all over the world, we now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper. Like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get in for it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. OK, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more check. It's the high fuel you know. Mr. Forson. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it. Right, to power the world. Ah yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, 10 years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now, we've got five or 10 years to make a huge difference. I need policy leaders all over the world to appreciate now. OK, big business is transacting with green hydrogen. In multi-billion dollar agreements, we now know it's here at the state that's spread everywhere.

13661," We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's ready to be released. Coming up on the program, the Hydrogen Revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utility firm, Snam, about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Bluebird Green. From Bluebird's World, Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bluebird Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? And solar and wind power homes around the world? A couple of years ago, the world's largest solar and wind power has been a huge impact on the world. The world's largest solar and wind power homes around the world. According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy industry. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today has spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully developed energy system, but it's going to be big. Costs are coming down, and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per meg of an hour. 2010, 600. Today, 100. And we see it going down to 50 and five years' time. And to going down to $25 per meg of an hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word is today. That's really because renewable energy and we're talking green hydrogen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1887,2022-10-11 17:48:42
13662," And to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so, which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here, renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. And one state expert, a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume, how big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships and pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. So and we say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And big scale. Because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get to 50% renewables. Where is the price? I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2070 because of the falling costs of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there, and we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology, it's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP, and I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years, or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. This missing is really the projects, and that's where companies take us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of SNAM, they're speaking with our Maria today. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a trade body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel, made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer, is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Highest fusion technology in our world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1888,2022-10-11 17:53:00
13663," Airbus ASEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident. But we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time. And we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are undergrowing pressure to ramp up short term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton. And that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg NEF. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex. Our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially race.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1889,2022-10-11 17:57:24
13664," as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So, we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source. And in things like despatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because, depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost declines in the future. So, when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So, if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. So, let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside, though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today, like coal or oil or natural gas. So, you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well, and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So, for green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caction storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist, and of course you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series.

13666," Well, at the active apparel company, Viori, a year ago, they raised 400 million bucks led by Softbank. What are they up to? We might even talk a little Elon Musk and Ian Bremer. Hold on, we'll get to that a little bit later on. First up, let's get to the Market Drivers report. Let's get to it, folks. Cretigoup, Da, Anchor and Market's correspondent at Bloomberg, here in our interactive broker studio, along with Abigail Doolittle, markets reporter at Bloomberg News. All right, Cretigook it off. Like I said, if you woke up a few hours ago, you're like, hey, if I'm bullish on the market, I'm pretty happy. Yeah, well, I was awake a few hours ago. Yes, it's not what it looked like. There was a lot of red on the screen. You were awake early. I, yes, I don't sleep, folks. I get paid not to. But basically, the S&P 500 was down. I think about 1% at session low. So you did see actually some selling in the market. To me, the move from across asset picture, and I'm sure there's technicals involved in here with Abby, which Abby can hit, was that as the dollar weakened further following the yields story, which is, I think, we had yields up quite a bit this morning, which have then since reversed, the dollar followed, and it feel like every tick lower that the dollar got, the stock market rose higher and higher. And that, I remember correctly, was the exact thing I said yesterday as well with Gina Marnatum's on this very show, because it does feel more like a cross-ass story than a trading story. The exception here being in the chip sector, where you're seeing a whole lot of pain, a lot of those stocks digesting what a further exports on chip technology to China or bands, I should say, is going to do to the sector as a whole. That's going to show a micron. It's top in the S&P 500 and now it's at 100, kind of an outlier. It is kind of interesting. But Nvidia's the one you want to watch, because that's the heavy weight. That's the one that's in line with Apple and Microsoft, and that's the one that could move the entire benchmark, and that one's also the one that's under pressure. Hey, Abigail, do a little, come on in here. What's your interpretation of what happened today? Why the reversal? I would agree with Crete on the dollar. I mean, if the dollar going down and that helps risk assets climb, you don't have commodities at this point, filing suit that Bloomberg commodity index still down to a four, four, four, tens of 1%. But I think also just a little bit of a relief rally. I mean, this is the first update in five. And I think that there's a strong chance that PPI and CPI this week may come out a little better than expected, or at least not worse than fear. I can't believe it's the first update in five. Sorry, I had to go back. I trusted you, but I was like, whoa, right? I know, it's a matter of time. You were always watching Zinflation Numbers. And then of course, the big banks kick off earnings and earnest on Friday. And I think that there's a chance that this earnings season similar to the one in July could turn out to be just a little bit better. It looks like we're do some sort of a rebound balance. Did you just say that CPI is going to come in light? Or could you, excuse me, could you don't have any insider information? No, I just based on a variety of factors. I think that there's a chance that CPI is going to be favored by traders. Wherever it comes in, whether that's meant for 8.1%, the last month, of course, was 8.3%. Maybe it comes in at 8.1%, maybe it comes in at 8%, maybe 7.9%. Maybe Core is not as heavy as expected. It could be anything. I just think that CPI is going to be a little bit better than expected. Will you start the JP Morgan note that said, if we get the CPI read that's too hot, we could see a 5% tumble. Of course we could. And we could not. I mean, it's like, no offense. Love you all on Wall Street. But we get everybody weighing in on different things. What I care about is a mix of market care and much more. A couple of things volume on an update. And I feel like we're seeing an uptick. I know you like the five day. And it looks like we're seeing an uptick on that. And I also like inflows. And I don't know if anybody saw that B of A story about heavy stock inflows pouring more money into US equities last week. New record inflows. Like I care about flows going in and out. That to me tells me about commitment or lack thereof. I don't know how you guys feel about that. Yeah, no, I would agree with you on that. I don't know how you feel about it, Creedy. I mean, I would agree with you on that, though. Yeah, I would agree as well. And I think to the point on the story. There are largest inflow in the banks data history since 2008. Net buyers, big net buyers of US equities at 6.1 billion. Well, you know what the narrative is right now? The market has been so exhausted here. I mean, we've been talking about capitulation for at least a year now. And we haven't really quite gotten there because you do continue to see these relief rallies. I'm not saying we're a fair yet. But one of the arguments that Gina Marnatham's actually brought up of Bloomberg Intelligence was that maybe the market is so tired that any earnings kind of win that they'll see the market will rally on it. So I wonder if this is going to be. Because it's so down, kind of going into it, isn't it? I think so. And I think that there is a good chance. And that's exactly what we saw in July. And we had that June to August rally, where it just wasn't as bad as expected. Now that said, this market continues to remind me of 2002, 2003, where it's just a long, slow move.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1892,2022-10-11 18:10:36
13667," in July when we had that June to August rally where it just wasn't as bad as expected. Now that said, this market continues to remind me of 2000 to 2003 where it's just a long, slow move to the bottom, but with these rebound rallies that are headfakes and everybody thinks. But when you think about the economy next year, and frankly just looking at the charts for next year, it does not look good. You have the IMF coming out today saying what people already know and the shaving of numbers in but saying that the worst has not happened yet. I think that they are probably right. I mean, housing could be a real drag. Kathy Wood even talking about that, everybody's focusing on the decent labor market report that we just got on Friday, but she says you look at some other aspects of the labor market you're seeing weakness. So I feel like. Yeah, look looks right. The exact noise is what people are thinking. Well, I think this is a key part of what Abigail was talking about on the CPI print as well. The market does feel so primed that even if the inflation number comes in at 8.1%, which was the estimate last time by the way. So for it to come into 8.1% this time, is not a massive stretch year over year. That being said, even that would be considered a win, even though once again, that was the exact estimate last month. Right. Another thing to keep in mind about inflation, this was what was so shocking about that 4.3% drop on that last one where it came in, I think at 8.5 or 8.3, and it was expected to come at 8.1. Inflation is going in the right direction. We may have seen peak inflation. It might have been at 9.3% and then it came down to 8.5, instead of 8.1 is 8.3, but we might be going in the right direction. That could be a good thing. Try the line, right? I've got to watch. If that's kind of building some momentum to the downside, that would be a good thing. That's a top. Anybody else got some funny sounds they want to make? No, you're a wrong man, Carol. You're just tricky. It's tricky. Criticoup and Abigail, do a little of Bloomberg. Thank you so much. Let's get to World of National News. Nancy Lyons is standing by in the 991 Roozer and NDC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is rolling out the possibility of peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He says on Telegram, there can be no dialogue with a leader who has no future. Group of seven leaders held a conference call today reiterating their support for Ukraine following two days of Russian missile attacks on the country. Zelensky asked them for a new package of sanctions against Russia and they pledged to hold Putin and others responsible to account. The Senate is interrupting its recess today to kick off its debate on the annual must-pass defense authorization bill. Only a few members will be on hand to participate and Senators Jack Raid and Jim Inhoff, the chair and ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, will likely be the only two on the floor. They'll offer a substitute amendment to the House-passed bill along with a package of amendments that have bipartisan support. But Senators filed more than 960 amendments to the bill. Staff members are carrying out informal negotiations to speed up adoption of a bicameral compromise bill in Washington, I may be more as Bloomberg radio. Former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbert says she's leaving the Democratic Party. I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that's under the complete control of an elitist cabal of war mongers who are driven by cowardly wokeness. That's Tulsi Gabbert on a new podcast. She ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The MLB playoffs are underway in the first game of the day. The Phillies lead the Braves, 4-1.

All right, Nancy, thank you so much. You are listening to Bloomberg Business Week. Karl Maser, along with Tim Stenevek Live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. A lot going on, including a lot of external events, you're gonna hear from an incredible array of speakers catching up with various members of our Bloomberg team. Yeah. I'm just gonna say, weeks like today, days like today, I'm reminded that okay, summer is completely over. The fall is like the sprint to the end for everybody. There's so many events that are back in session whether the indoors are outdoors. I don't believe a lot. Yeah, some incredible names. All right, we wanna mention one of those incredible names was of course, Ray Dalio, who created the world's largest hedge fund we're talking about, Bridgewater. And earlier today, Bloomberg's David Weston, catching up with Ray Dalio. And they talked about a lot of things, including what the Fed has to trade off between lower inflation and a stunted economy, check it out. Interest rates have gotta go up to a level that constricts private credit demand. And when that happens,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1893,2022-10-11 18:14:36
13668," the stunted economy check it out. Interest rates have got to go up to a level that constricts private credit demand. And when that happens, then there's less spending. That's the mechanics. So there's that trade-off. And I think we're going to be in an environment in which they're trying to navigate these two difficult. You know, I want too much inflation and you don't want too weak an economy. And so they're trying to navigate that, which will be probably something like the 70s. And that, of course, was Bridgewater Fountain Ray Dalio. And you can check out more from that interview. You can find it on the Bloomberg terminal at Bloomberg.com. And of course, recently our own Eric Schatzker reporting that the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates has given up control of the firm. He built into the world's largest hedge fund. So passing it on, passing the baton to a younger generation, 150 billion in assets, we listen to what he says. He often thinks about the broader community at large. But I feel like that has been one of the big macro conversations to them that we're having in terms of fighting inflation, what that will do ultimately to economic growth. Yeah, that's what the IMF came out and talked about earlier. And the IMF was sure to point out that, hey, if central banks don't do their job and bring inflation down, the effect of this of rising rates could be worse, but rising rates that's hard on the world. And that's what the IMF was more concerned about. The global such banks being aggressive enough to bring down inflation. So essentially not doing enough. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1894,2022-10-11 18:18:50
13669," you Markets headlines and breaking news 24 hours a day at Bloomberg dot com the Bloomberg business out and a Bloomberg quicktake. This is a Bloomberg business flash. Can be no dial. Industrial average up to 190 points are now by 1% and as stack is down 36 to drop there of 4, 10 to 1%. 10 year yield 3.88% the 2 year 4.28% spot gold up 6, 10 to 1% 16, 78 the ounce. While West Texas, NMD crew is down 1.7%, 89, 56 a barrel. Uber and Lyft are tumbling after the Biden administration issued a proposal for a federal rule that would change the way it approaches.

Recapping S&P on track for its first daily gain in 5 days, dip buyers emerging in the market S&P up now by 2.10% I'm Charlie Pelifat is a Bloomberg business flash. Well I think you for that update. Well a lot going on as we said a lot of external events going on and Bloomberg and its team are all over the place talking to the voices that you want to hear from and earlier today from the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut Bloomberg New Economy and a Toriel Director Eric Schatzger sat down for a conversation that included our Invest Founder CEO and CIO Kathy Wood. He covered a lot of ground and Eric began by citing the reasons for today's market volatility and selling from a geopolitical elements and the war in Ukraine to inflation and Fed policy. Check it out. You're often a contrarian and unconventional thinker and I just give you the conventional reasons for why what has happened happened from your perspective. What happened? We agreed that if inflation and interest rates took off that would be a problem for high valuation stocks. But I do think what is happening now we saw a dry run of it before COVID. So if you remember before COVID as we realized what a problem we had on our hands, the globe had. I think the markets were down in one month's time 25% we were down 46%. From those lows as you just said we from April 20 to 21, 35360% since then just to keep the perspective here down 75% at our low in May. Now we're probably testing it today as we speak so we shall see. I think one of the things that has happened is during risk off periods we see a rush back into indexes. So a lot of the market's gone passive but when we move into risk off this idea of career risk, business risk, surfaces and discussions and there's a movement back into benchmark stocks. We don't own the big benchmark stocks. Only one of our stocks has made it into the benchmarks and that's Tesla. Believe it or not Tesla is held up better than our portfolios. So I think there's been a lot of algorithmic trading. I felt it pre-COVID, the variables algorithms focused on cash burn, cash cushion.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1895,2022-10-11 18:22:47
13670," So I think there's been a lot of algorithmic trading. I felt it pre-COVID, the variables algorithms focused on cash burn, cash cushion. And yet at the time we were saying, wait a minute, this makes no sense. This is COVID. And we need to solve this problem, innovation solves problems. And so that was one of the reasons we had that swish, right? We were solving problems, global digitalization, figuring out how to, we sequenced the coronavirus and so forth. I think the same thing now. We've had this incredible decline. We have so many more problems now, supply chain, rushes invasion of Ukraine. Innovation solves problems. And yet these algorithms and very short term time horizons. The ours is five years, the market in risk off goes to one quarter. Algorithms are dominating the market. It's very interesting. Most people don't know what our companies do. And they don't know the kinds of problems they are solving. But as we've gone through this period, the 75% decline, we've concentrated from 58 names to 33 names to our highest conviction names. Typically, that's a very good strategy for the turn in the market. And that was editorial director for Blue Ragnarew Economy, Eric Schatzker, speaking earlier at the Greenwich Economic Forum with our investment management, founder, CIO, CEO, of course, Kathy Wood. And her mandate mission strategy has always been innovation disruption. And a five-year time horizon. And a five-year time horizon. And her calls on Tesla when everybody else was anti-it. We're really spot on. She was on in there earlier. But got to say that her investment and her strategy has really taken a beating. It has. Over the last, you know, I mean, look at 2020. It was just an incredible year for her. But over the last two years, it's been pretty tough. Yeah, right now, the flagship we're talking about, Arc Innovation ETF is threatening to take out its low reach during the depths of the pandemic. So we're talking about going back to that March 20, low of 3469 right now. It's at 3581. But we've seen over the last few days, it continued to grind. Low. I was really interested to hear from her carol the way that her conviction has changed in the terms of number of companies that she finds her focus on, right? When I'm going it down. Exactly. So fewer companies and essentially, meaning there's higher conviction there. The thing about a five-year time horizon is, you know, eventually it's going to be five years, right? She's been saying that for several years at this point. Right, because she's been doing this now for seven, eight years or so. Yeah. Yeah. You know, she is one of those individuals who has certainly shaped the conversation, no doubt about it, over the last four or five years in a big way. And you see much of Wall Street copycats, if you will, in terms of starting up investment funds that are about innovation and disruption in particular. So there are many people who are big believers and there are those that are not. What I find interesting too is the research that Eric Bultrionis from our Bloomberg intelligence team brings in. Big picture talking about ETFs, such as ARC Invest ETF, with so much money going into passive funds now. Increasingly, you have people experimenting or kind of playing with just a small portion of their funds. So companies like ARC Invest Cathy Wood end up being the beneficiaries of that, because they say, okay, well, if I'm 95% passive, then I can, you know, afford to throw a 5% of my portfolio into something like that. And you certainly see it. We do want to point out another story on the Bloomberg. Today has to do with Cathy Wood buying another tranche of Adobe shares as the stock languages near its mid-September low when it cratered after announcing its biggest ever acquisition. You can check what her ETFs are doing every day after the market closed. And we often have seen her when a stock gets beaten up. We've seen her either double down or pick into one of those names that she already has conviction about. Also interesting about Tesla being the only benchmark company that she has. Yeah, it is kind of interesting, right? Hey, check out the conversation that Eric did in its entirety. You can find that and more reporting on the conversation at Bloomberg.com. And of course, on the Bloomberg terminal. Coming up, we're going to talk about a story that has Paul Voker and Jay Powell in it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1896,2022-10-11 18:27:22

This is Bloomberg Business Week. Yes indeed everybody, you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on Bloomberg Radio and on YouTube. Coming up, we're going to talk about what we can learn from Paul Volcker when it comes to today's Fed, J Powell and monetary policy. Yeah, and we got a pretty good person in here to talk all about it. Great. The person who helped write Paul Volcker was a memoir. So Christine Harper is going to be joining us in just a minute. First up, they'll Charlie Pellet. Let's get a check in the markets. We got less than 90 minutes to go. Indeed, and we are holding on to gains, at least on the S&P and the Dow. Nezdaq back in the red bin that kind of a day. Choppy's session right now at the Dow up 328, a gain there of 1.1%. S&P up 13, up 4, 10, so 1% Nezdaq in the red down. 13 points now, a drop there of 1.1%. But let me put the S&P's gain in perspective. Right now, the S&P 500 index hard by 4, 10s. Worse level of day in the early going. S&P had hit below the year down 1.2%. Stocks trimmed their advance in a choppy session that saw the S&P down at the lowest in-fri-day level since 2020. S&P 500 though, holding on to gains. 10 year yield, 3.88%. The 2 year 4.28% spot-golled up $9.00, the ounce of 6 tenths of 1%. West Texas, NVIDIA crew down 2.2%. 89.14, a barrel. Well, as for the interest rate outlook and what it's taking for federal reserve policy makers to bring inflation under control, Waley is Global Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock International. In order to fight inflation, which is the sole focus for central banks at this juncture, it's going to carry much higher cost to the economy, but also financial stability. So in our assessment, to bring inflation down to targets quickly enough, actually, it would require a 2% shot to the US economy next year and also an additional 3 million people out of a job pushing unemployment rate to 5%. And again, we do have the tenure now yielding 3.88%. More on the federal reserve coming up in just a moment with our Christine Harper. American Airlines climbing after saying it expects to post third quarter sales above prior guidance. American Airlines mixed picture today for a lot of the airline names. We do have American up now by 3.4%, UAL up 0.4%, delta down 4.10% of 1% southwest up 6.10% of 1%. Jeff Blue down 7.10% of 1%. I'm Charlie Palatin, that is a Bloomberg Business Flash.

13673," 10th of 1% I'm Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Tuesday. Carol Master, along with Tim Stenevich. What we mentioned earlier, you know, what's past is prologue, which gets us to a story in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business Week. It'll be a new double issue out later this week. It's a story about Paul Voker's inflation fight and how it hints at what lies ahead for the current Fed chief, Jay Powell. Yeah, the Fed had to inflict a lot of pain in the 80s. She convinced markets. It was serious. We've got just a fantastic guest with us this afternoon. Christine Harper is executive editor of Finance and Investing at Bloomberg Editorial. She joins us live in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. She's also along with Paul Voker, the co-author of Keeping Addit, the quest for sound money and good government. It's Paul Voker's memoir. So Christine, you spent a lot of time with the late former chairman of the Federal Reserve. I just want to start with with that as some context here. Give us an idea of, you know, how he would, in your interpretation, look at the inflation fight that Jay Powell is doing today. Well, I can tell you when he was writing his memoir back in 2017-2018, no, but he was paying attention to inflation. In fact, if they were at all, it was in an effort to get more inflation, right? So he was quite concerned that people were underestimating the risks. And so part of the mission of the book was to remind people of how important the central bank's role is in keeping inflation down and maintaining that credibility that he fought so hard to maintain. I mean, he had been involved in getting the dollar off the gold standard. And after that, the dollar was not, it was not connected to any actual value. And so when inflation took root, he had to, you know, drive interest rates up to unprecedented levels cause all kinds of pain for people, for financial institutions. And the result was there was more credibility in the dollar. Some people talked about it, went on the Volker standard from the gold standard. But, you know, that's something you can't squander because he fought so hard. So it's kind of like having gone to war to fight, you know, to win a battle and then discover that your future, you know, commanders are allowing you to give up the territory again. So he would have been very upset that inflation was allowed to get to where it was. We're talking about Christine Harper. And as we mentioned, this is in the upcoming new double issue of Bloomberg Business Week out later this week. Also with us is the editor of Bloomberg Business Week, Joel Weber. Christine, thank you for this remarks. I also just wanted to ask, you know, and you might have to extrapolate here a little bit. But I mean, you got to know Mr. Volker very well. I'm curious what you think of anything Powell might have learned from him. And if not him directly, then the book. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, you know, as you and I have discussed, I mean, one of the things that's so interesting is how often Fed Chairman Powell invokes not only, you know, Volker himself, who he says he's a great admirer of, but the book, I mean, he talks about everybody should read it. And he has used this phrase, keep at it, which people see as an echo of the title keeping at it. Let's say that title one more time. Keeping at it. And, you know, the thing that I think Powell sees. And I mean, one thing that Volker made clear was when I was speaking to him was how much he's he supported Powell as Fed Chairman, because he liked the fact that Powell had this similar to Volker had this experience of having worked in the financial in a private financial institution. In Volker's case, it was Chase and Powell's case, it's Carlisle and other places. And also working at the Treasury Department. So understanding markets, understanding the government is really important to being practical in the job and not just being an academic theorist. So I think Powell shares that sort of recognition that you have to win credibility from the markets, from the government, all these sides, and be practical in your approach and not just, you know, not just trust all the economists around it. Christine, how tough was it for Volker to hike rates? Like, what were some of the conversations that you all had about that, which was going against what everybody wanted, but it was necessary in order to write the situation? Well, to that point, I mean, he said that when he came into the role, it was clear. I mean, the reason he was brought in really was to do something about inflation that his predecessors hadn't really succeeded in bringing down",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1899,2022-10-11 18:40:23
13674," And he said that when he came into the role, it was clear. I mean, the reason he was brought in really was to do something about inflation that his predecessors hadn't really succeeded in bringing down. Even so, at that point, the economists at the Fed were forecasting our session. So he had to sort of ignore that and just say, we're going to raise rates. There was a split on the Federal Reserve board on the second time they voted. And so the markets didn't believe there would be any stronger action. They thought the Fed was going to lose their spine. And so he turned to this monitorist approach of just targeting the money supply. And that essentially told people, we're tying our hands, and we're going to let interest rates go where they have to go. And they went up to like 20%. Yeah. There's a name in here that I did not expect to see that I wanted to ask about Larry Cutlow, who was quoted by the Associated Press at the time. And he was at Bear's Turns, then. What did Mr. Cutlow have to say? Well, I mean, it was funny looking back at the clips because when Paul Volker was telling me about this fourth revote and nobody believed it. And he didn't understand really why nobody believed it because he knew that people were supporting him would keep supporting him. But the markets didn't. So I did some research and found these comments that were made in the press at the time, including from then Fed Bear's Turns economist, Larry Cutlow, saying that essentially the fact that the vote had split on the FOMC showed that there would be very timid approach going forward. The markets just didn't see the Fed being able to stick to their guns. OK, so I've got to ask a question. Because this book almost had a different title. Oh, yes. And we've got to talk about that because it's just this little Easter egg. Can you talk to us about the chariot? Sure, of course. So as I mentioned earlier, when we started working on the book, nobody was really paying attention to some of the central parts of Paul Walker's legacy, including inflation. And so he was feeling a little, I think, overlooked. And so he opened the book with this very funny joke about a pirate, a wise parrot who's known as the chairman. And I encourage people to look at the book because it's a very funny little story. But he went so far as saying he wanted to title the book, the wise old parrot speaks. Now, the marketing department and I all agreed that was not a great title for this book. So we spent weeks trying to offer him other ideas, all of which he rejected. He hated all the pompous kind of pretentious titles that a lot of other economists and people use on their books. So we were really going back and forth. It was very, it was one of the most difficult things of working with him. Because he was so stubborn on this. And so finally, one day, I was going through this long list of titles I'd come up with. I found a phrase from the Fed minutes at that time, sustained commitment. And he looked and he stopped and he said, keeping at it. And it was great because that really was him. He believed in speaking plainly. And so he took the kind of jargonny phrase and translated it. But I do think it would be funny if Powell was having to deal with the wise old parrot. I feel like, hey, it just goes to show everyone needs a really good editor. That's what it comes down to. Save you from yourself. Even Paul. Exactly. Hey, Christine, I just want to talk a little bit about his legacy from a market's perspective and from an investing perspective as well. Given what we know about the 1980s and what markets did and what inflation did after he raised rates so significantly, what's in store this time around? Well, I mean, I think everybody is seeing that interest rates are going to go up. Policy makers are making it very clear they're not going to back down on this. If they show any signs of weakness, I think people understand what will happen is kind of what happened to Paul Volker's predecessor. So I think that is an example of where Powell sees he has to be steadfast. But as you would see reading the book, the chapters that follow the inflation fight are a series of financial crises that Paul Volker's Fed had to deal with in the wake of the interest rate increases. And so when you hear these experts come on Bloomberg radio and television talking about something my break, I think what we saw back in the 80s was a lot of things broke. A lot of things weren't sort of, a lot of risks were built up, everything from the hunt brothers, Becky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1900,2022-10-11 18:44:46
13675," I think, you know, what we saw back in the 80s was a lot of things broke. A lot of things weren't sort of, a lot of risks were built up. Everything from the hunt brother speculation on silver to continental Illinois, savings and loans, all these different banks that wouldn't belly up. And so the ultimate one was the Latin American debt crisis. And that was so bad that in 82, I think that was really what caused Volker to say, okay, we've got it back off and stop the inflation fight. So ultimately it is often that something breaks that there's a financial crisis. I think it's interesting on a day when the IMF has revised its estimates and the concern is about global central banks not doing enough. It fits right into your story and certainly your book. Christine, thank you so much. Christine Harper, check out her store in the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week. And of course, our thanks to Jill Weber, the editor of the magazine. Christine is editor of Bloomberg Market's magazine. Thanks guys. Do you want to welcome our television and radio audiences? And really please say we can get to an exclusive interview from the Robin Hood Investors Conference, our very own Chanel Ibausei, standing by with a special guest. Chanel, take it away. Thank you so much Taylor. I'm sitting here with David Einhorn, who is the founder of Greenlight Capital. Welcome to our Bloomberg Television and Radio audiences. You know, David, thank you so much from joining us here at the Robin Hood Investors Conference. You are known as a classic value investor. But you've said so recently to your investors that value has not made a comeback yet. What is the point at which it does make a comeback? And are there specific signals you're looking for in the market for that to happen? Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me on. And I'm thrilled to be here at the Robin Hood Conference. It's always meant a lot to me. I helped find it 10 years ago and this is our 10th anniversary. So we're super excited to be here and to talk. And thank you for having me on your program. Relating to value investing, I don't know that it ever comes back. You know, there have been serious changes to the market structure. And pretty much most of the value investors have been put out of business. So if value investing is trying to do security analysis, think about what companies are worth, think about why they might be misvalued or misunderstood, and then do valuation analysis that tells you that that in fact is true. There's just very few of us left. Most market participants these days, they either cannot do value. They're just not trained or experienced in knowing how to do valuations. Or their structure doesn't allow them to. Like if they're an index fund or a passive thing, the last thing you're doing is value. Or their system is a quantitative system or a trading system or an algorithmic system. And or your style is to just buy things that have charts that go up into the right. And none of those participants are really doing value. So it used to be, you know, that on every conference call of every company, there were like dozens of analysts from all of these competing, long-only hedge fund, long-short people and stuff like that, trying to hear what companies were doing and saying and trying to figure it out. And those staffs have been gutted because the world is move passive. And so there's just a lot less competition for what we do. Well, what does that mean for how you operate as an investor? If you're saying that so much of the world has turned passive or quantitative, has that made your job fundamentally different as somebody who picks specific securities? It absolutely does. It used to be we could buy something at a reasonably low multiple, whatever we thought that was. Think that the company would do somewhat better, benefit from it being somewhat better, and realize that other investors would see what we saw six months later, a year later, and would re-rate the shares. So you could buy something 11 times earnings, and maybe they would earn 10% more, but you'd get another three points on the multiple, and you'd make 50% over two or three years. That isn't happening anymore because there's nobody to notice what actually happens at these companies. So the other side of that is, is nobody knows what anything is worth. So there's an enormous number of companies that are dramatically misvalued in ways that we haven't seen before. So it's whereas before we might pay eight times or nine times or 12 times, it seemed like low multiples. But now we can buy a lot of those same companies at three times earnings, or four times earnings. And if they're buying back 10 or 15 or 20 or 40% of their stock in some cases, eventually we're going to have to get paid by the company as opposed to having other investors figure out what we thought we figured out before them. Well, to the extent you're seeing some better...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1901,2022-10-11 18:49:09
13676," In some cases, eventually we're going to have to get paid by the company as opposed to having other investors figure out what we thought we figured out before them. Well, to the extent we're seeing some better evaluations in the markets to buy specific stocks, I'm wondering if you still think that there are bubbles out there in the market. We have seen a drawdown to a degree already. There's a lot of worries that that drawdown might be bigger. And so do you still see bubbles? Well, sure, of course. Because the absence of people doing valuation means that nobody knows what anything is worth. And the market doesn't know what anything is worth. And so you had a period of time, like in 2018, where if you just took the highest valued companies, a priori, they went up the most. 30%, 40% for the top-design. The bottom-design went down 20%. So all you had to know is, is it already highly valued? And if it was highly valued it went up more. And if it was lowly valued it went down. And so you had this bifurcation of the market and that bifurcation basically remains. So people look at those companies that ran away and they were already overvalued and they became even more overvalued. And they look at them now and go, oh my goodness, they're down 50%, they're down 70%. Whatever it is, they must be cheap because a deep value, even one person I heard say, talking about stuff that was down a lot from a recent high. But all you're saying is, is it a discount to some previous price, which was obviously wrong? So just because something I would say on the way up, twice a silly price isn't twice a silly. But something that's half of a priori is not deep value. In fact, the joke really is, is what do you call a stock that's down 90%. It's a stock that was down 80% and then it got cut in half. So let's add in then the cocktail of higher interest rates. Because some of this is based on, as you say, price to earnings or even kind of relative value, if you will. So what happens as rates rise? How do you discount where stocks should be, specific stocks in particular, as the terminal value has not been designated yet on where the Fed lands? Yeah, I think that that is not the right way to look at things these days. Because nobody's actually doing those calculations in any case. It's not like people are looking at it and saying, well, with interest rates at 2%, I can pay 9 times for this, but at 4%, I got to pay 7 times for this. That's not really what people are doing. What you basically have is you have companies where the value is fundamentally disconnected and you can figure out what we're in is the bear market. And so in a bear market, those things get derated. And you can say, well, the proximate cause of the bear market is inflation or interest rates or the Fed or all of those things. But in a bear market is when ultimately it turns out, if you buy something and it's just at the wrong price, it's a long way down before somebody like me is going to want to come in and say, okay, this is actually really pretty cheap. Pretty cheap, you say. We're in a bear market, you say, but are we in a recession? I'm wondering if you can calculate the probability as you see it, of what a hard landing would look like. Yeah, look, I heard the understand, look, the politicians are debating whether we're in a recession, they don't really know what the definition is. They also don't know what the definition of a woman is. So they're confused. And there's a lot of confusion that's out there on these type of things. I don't think it matters whether we're in a recession. I think what matters is, is things are in a slowing. And so it matters is, is the general direction of things. It doesn't really matter whether we're technically in a recession or whether it's technically a soft landing or a hard landing. What we are is we're in a period of economic, slow down or deterioration. And that's when things that were overvalued tend to get derated. Talk to me about that slow down. Do you think that, as you talk to CEOs, as you talk to other investors, do you think that there's a mismatch here about expectations about where earnings are headed from here? Whether it's because the cost of financing for companies are going up or whether it's because you think earnings revisions might go down further than you've seen them. Do you think that there's a mismatch out there? Well, some earnings will go up and some earnings will go down. I think it's a company by company type of circumstance. Companies that are in energy, for example, I expect the earnings are going to continue to be very strong in materials and some other areas that are more benefiting from the difficulties that we have. We've under invested in some areas, which has allowed there to be a dearth of capital placed into...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1902,2022-10-11 18:53:28
13677," areas that are more benefiting from the difficulties that we have. You know, we've under-invested in some areas, which has allowed there to be a dearth of capital placed into, you know, not the software is eating the world companies, but the really boring ones. And, you know, when was the last time we put a cement factory in this country? And when was the last time we created an oil refinery? We've under-invested in these areas, and that's going to allow companies that are in these areas to earn excess profits for a substantial period of time, because they don't face the normal competition that you'd have if you, if we were trying to grow these sectors. I have to ask you more about the role of inflation here when it comes to why companies are earning. On one hand, there's a concern that lower inflation would mean lower profits as well, but higher inflation, as we know, has also been an issue. This morning, Radalio had told my colleague that he thinks structural inflation could be 4% to 5%. What do you think? Well, Ray knows more about this than I do. I think we have moved from whatever that 40-year period of structural reduced inflation and deflation. I think we are now in an era of inflation, but I don't really want to quantify and come up with a figure, because I wouldn't know how to make one. Well, I'll follow up on something you said earlier this year. You had said that the Fed hiking interest rates at 25 basis points at a time was like taking an ice cream scoop or two a driveway full of snow. Now that you're seeing the rate hikes be at a greater scale, do you think they're doing enough? I think that they were very slow in getting started. I think the Fed chairman wanted to be reappointed. I think that slowed things down. I think it took them a long time to recognize the inflation. I think they, for a while, were like, well, let's continue using, because we only have 1.7% inflation or let's keep using, because we don't have full employment everywhere, and we blew up a great big bubble. And a lot of things. I think the sad thing that comes from that is if we don't want to have a huge inflation problem, they need to do what they can about it. Frankly, I don't think the Fed has complete control over inflation. I think half of the inflation problem is a fiscal problem. And there's no discussion at all about making fiscal measures to either increase supply, which would actually be a nice thing to do, because if you increase supply, you increase wealth, and you make people rich. Instead, what we're doing is as we're trying to reduce demand, which essentially means lower everybody's standard of living to try to fight the inflation. But nonetheless, inflation needs to be fought. And the Fed can only control what it can control. I think it's a mistake to put them as the sole responsibility for fixing this. There's a lot of people who have a lot of concerns about systemic risks in the system, whether it's fiscal or whether it's something else. What do you think is the biggest concern out there that investors are not counting for? Well, look, the systemic risks have built up in the government bond markets all around the world. From 2008 on, we socialized at the financial crisis. We've socialized a lot of other things. The fiscal situation is difficult in all of the developed markets. Here we are. We're at the top of an economic recovery, and there's still a trillion dollar deficit. And that's before rates change, before next year's cola increases, before the economy slows. And before we decide whether we need to do something to bail out a weaker government like Britain or Japan or something like that. So there's all kinds of build up on the sovereign. And it's not unique to the United States. All of the major developed sovereigns have this issue. We say here we're fine in the US because Japan has 250% debt to GDP, and nothing so bad has happened there. But what if something is beginning to happen bad there? The end is weakened considerably. They've had to intervene in the currency, and the numbers that have always been on the page. When you have a down cycle is when these things tend to metastasize. All right. You've been listening to David Einhorn, of course, of Greenlight Capital, live from the Robin Hood Conference in New York City, sitting down in a live interview, a Bloomberg exclusive on radio TV and YouTube with Bloomberg's Shunali Balsik. And I think what I really took away, this is a guy who has looked for value plays, right? And opportunities, if you will, and he says there's very few of us left, but he also went on to say that he's not to evaluate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1903,2022-10-11 18:57:50
13678," If you will, and he says there's very few of us left, but he also went on to say that he's not sure a value investing ever comes back. And I thought what was interesting to him is he says nobody knows what anything is worth. We are looking at the market environment, still unsure and uncertain about the future. And so how do you make the correct valuation? A lot of it has to do with discount rate and of course with interest rates. So how do you know, how do you value something if you are unclear with how far rates are going to have to climb? Correct, right? And how persistent inflation is. He also said systemic risks have built up in global bond markets. You know, so many of the conversations when we talk with investors, especially people like David Einhorn, it's basically what are the risks that are out there? What is it that we might be missing? What's the next crisis? And many would say it's not going to be like the financial crisis that we saw the housing mortgage meltdown. It's not like the tech bubble. Probably something else. He also said the Fed got a slow start when it came to fighting inflation, Chanel, a plastic there referencing comments that he's made, you know, about 25 basis point hikes. He said that was akin to using an ice cream scooper to clear driveway of snow. Yeah, I mean, it's tricky. And this is something we just talked about with Christine Harper, about Jay Powell needing to stay the course just like Paul Boquer back in the 1970s. It's not easy. This is Bloomberg Radio. Did you think about that you were supposed to say that you meant it to be expensive in........",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1904,2022-10-11 19:02:01
13679," We are counting you down to the close. Just 60 minutes left in your trading session Caroline Hyde, remain Bostick Taylor-Riggs. So with us now, our colleagues, Karam Asat and Stenevich, we together welcome across our audiences TV radio, YouTube to dissect what is a market that turns once again lower and it is big tech in the line of firecar. Yeah, absolutely. We are well off our best levels of the day. We were seeing a positive tone but certainly very different. We've just got a slight gain on the Dow Jones industrial average. I mean, one of the sectors I was keeping a watch on was Biotech, which seemed to have some outperformance even when we were up on the day at more than 2 percent. But we're seeing even that group, which so many names continue to be in the news and we've seen quite a run out performance in the market overall for Biotech versus the major market averages. But right now, Tim, that index too is flat and just a little bit lower. We're actually seeing some underperformance when it comes to casinos with exposure to Macau, specifically win resorts in casinos. Las Vegas, Sands, both down about 8 percent right now. This comes after a day yesterday where we got weak spending data during China's golden week holiday. And then today that commentary from the IMF that warned of a worsening outlook for the global economy, not helping things either. And does seem to be a global narrative that pushes us lower. Maybe some of those words coming from Andrew Bailey of the Bank of England, just adding to the selling pressure as we see the NASDAQ now off by 1.34 percent. 140 points lower. We're currently seeing, of course, the likes of the Russell 2000, also under pressure by 5.10%. The S&P turned negative just at those moments that we heard from B.O.E. down by really through quarters of a percent. Still just the Dow that cleans to the green, but any by 21 points, Tina. You see a similar sort of narrative on an individual sector level, getting less green remain now, only just a few sectors here in the green. Really staples, real estate, health care leading the way, some of the more defensive in nature. Otherwise, all the way down on this green, it really has been a story of, financials and tactics consistently into pressure. Technology is off now an additional 2 percent today. You now have about a five day losing streak of the NASDAQ 100. That's the longest streak that we've seen this year. And you have to ask yourself about the importance of what's going on in the semiconductor space here. As we see that group down once again, Taiwan's semi now down for a fourth straight day down, 7 percent here on the day. And that's the story for a lot of the chip equipment makers, primarily like KLA, as well as a land research, which point out some companies like micron, Western Digital, holding up a little bit better as they have a little bit less exposure to some of those regulatory and restrictions that could be coming down the pipe from the Biden administration, speaking of which, keep an eye on Uber and Lyft. Uber shares down 10 percent on the back of that labor department, finally putting out some clarity, some rules, proposed rules, we should say, for how we classify gig workers. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms down 4 percent on the day down at its lowest level since 2018. And if you're looking for a bright spot out there, it continues to be in the M&A space. Joby Aviation up about 6.5 percent. This is going to be these little helicopter taxi things that will lift off and take you to the airport and say, are you just taking a cab or something? Well, Delta Airlines is taking a stake in the company, pretty significant deal. It's like a fight. Yeah. We'll be hearing much more of course Delta earnings coming tomorrow. I think though, the market made a turn at 238, basically, when we started to hear from the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, urging investors, basically, that they got to finish winding up their positions, and they can't maintain them in the bond market at the moment. The central bank is saying, look, we will no longer be intervening in this market by the end of this week. You have got three days, he said, basically, to the pension community over in the UK. The financial stability, of course, is one that we worry about. The talk of going through wind shields has been one that we've heard uttered from Ellery and today, and of course, Bob Michael, J.P. Morgan. We want to go, therefore, to Abelimerge International Economics and Policy Correspondent Michael McKee, who is keeping abreast of what's happening from the I.I.F. in Eventware, Andrew Bailey was speaking in Washington, and clearly he's unnerved the markets. Yes, and I think that may have been his goal. I said it on the speech by Andrew Bailey, the appearance, and he spent a lot of time defending the bank's decision to get involved. But again, as you mentioned, made it clear, the bank has now given the pension funds who had duration problems with length-long-dated paper and with shorter-dated paper inflation linked that they need to clear that up by the end of the week because the bank says it will get out of the business. Interesting reaction in the markets is guilt stay lower. The yield stays lower, but the pound falls over as your chart showed, and it does suggest that there's some disagreement about whether or not they'll be able to do this. Andrew Bailey is saying that the bank got-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1905,2022-10-11 19:06:43
13680," is lower, but the pound falls over as your chart showed. And it does suggest that there's some disagreement about whether or not they'll be able to do this. Andrew Bailey saying that the bank got involved because the markets were so volatile. He said much more volatile than in any of the stress tests that his predecessor, Mark Carney, had designed. He said there's a time when banks have to get involved because they have a financial stability mandate back in March of 2020. It was financial stability, but it was also monetary policy because the economies of Great Britain and the rest of the world were going down because of COVID. This time, he said they're going in opposite directions and the bank has to intervene to keep financial markets from melting down. Yeah, I feel like I've certainly seen this playbook and heard it before, Mike, as you just referenced in terms of the financial crisis. This is the sticky place, though, right? That global central banks, like we're seeing over in England, find themselves in market stability, but also having to pursue a certain kind of global monetary policy in order to bring down inflation. I mean, this is what's at odds right now. That's why they want to get out of it because they're working at odds with each other. They're at one point trying to tighten policy and another, they're loosening it at least for those in a certain space. And they don't want to be in that business, but that's the problem that all central banks are going to face. We don't know what, as one newspaper article said today, what bodies are going to float to the surface as all central banks start to tighten? And so there may be others who have to intervene at least on a short-term basis to keep trades going through. Yeah, and I'll be interesting to see what happens come Friday, of course, already seen some of the damage, minor damage, though, when it comes to the pound today, as well as those guilds, we'll see if we get back over that 5% threshold that we are at, just, I don't know, what was it, three weeks ago? I'm a Bloomberg's Michael McKee down in Washington, going to be keeping an eye on that. And guys, this gets us back here to some of those broader macro, and I guess if I can dare say that some of the potential systemic issues that central bankers now I have to keep their eye on. Talking about forces that odds with each other. At least you have a federal reserve here trying to be consistent with their messaging. There was never a pivot. We are hawkish. We're tackling inflation. And that really pushes us forward to the big inflationary print that we're going to be expecting as well in just a few days. Interesting, some of the comments that we heard from the IMF saying it's not going anywhere down to 2%, globally, at least, anytime soon. Yeah, and that the worst is yes to yet to come as well. I mean, that's a serious concern. But, you know, Caroline, we don't always have a perfect track record with the way that the IMF is able to sort of forecast this stuff. So investors certainly keeping that in mind as well. I mean, the IMF has been pointing the finger long and hard at the UK in terms of fiscal, not working hand in hand with monetary policy at the moment. And of course, that odds being shown clearly. We also, though, have the inflation print, but not also what House from the consumer remains. In the US, you've got the best dirty shirt, really, at the moment, it's the rest of the world that is having to absorb the shock of a stronger US dollar and indeed, the bond seller. And just going back to Chanel's interview with David Ironhorn over a green light, nobody knows what anything is worth. And this is the tricky part in this environment. We really don't know a lot about how long we stay at these levels, how long these global central banks have to raise rates. And it's very tricky when it comes to really getting the correct valuations at this point. All right, folks, a lot going on. It's only Tuesday. We're going to be back. We're going to count you down to the closing bell, our cross-platform coverage, our simulcast on radio TV, and YouTube. We will count you down to the close on this Tuesday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Masser and Bloomberg Quick Takes, Tim Stenevig, on Bloomberg Radio. All right, everybody. Just a reminder of where we are in terms of the equity markets, as we mentioned, the head of the Bank of England, Governor Bailey, saying that intervention markets will be temporary, giving people a few days, three days, I believe, to be exact to that there will be a change once again in policy, and that intervention will come to an end. In the meantime, we have definitely seen it play out in the US markets. If you ever wondered whether or not we are all globally connected, we certainly are, because stocks have almost moved back to their lows of the session down the most on a percentage basis when it comes to the NASDAQ, which is down 1.4%. Yeah, 2.43 PM, 2.43 Wall Street time this afternoon is when the S&P 500 started moving lower. I would have said it was searching for direction for much of the day today until that point, Carol, but we are firmly not at lows of the day, but getting close there down about 9 tenths of 1%. And a lot more momentum behind taking on some risk, and that's what we saw.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1906,2022-10-11 19:11:07
13681," day to day until that point, Carol, but we are firmly not at lows of the day, but getting close there down about 9, 10, so 1% on the list. And a lot more momentum behind taking on some risk. And that's what we saw prior to this news. And we also did see the VIX pop the volatility index going as high as 34 just above it. So up about one and a half points as we sit right now. So we saw a pop on that news as well. But this is, you know, again, we talk about the macro economic things and the things that just keeping at us. And I thought Mike was, you know, really smart and saying that, you know, in terms of policy, it has to be clear, it can't be at odds with one another because the really global mission right now is to get inflation down. Yeah, it's not just a US problem. We're going to get those numbers from in the US on Thursday, 0.1% is what's expected on CPI. It'll still be high though. Still high and still higher on the world as well. All right, right now back to world of national news for that. It's over to Nancy Lyons. She's in DC Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Carol. The US is speaking out against the latest Russian barrage of missile attacks on Ukraine with the State Department's Ned Price saying, Russian president Vladimir Putin has demonstrated how low he will sink. We've always said this is a brutal war of aggression. And these strikes seem to suggest that brutality and brutality alone is the point. Ned Price says Putin is the only person who can end this invasion. And he adds the core principles of the UN charter are at stake. Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Mnendez is calling for a freeze on US relations with Saudi Arabia after OPEC's agreement to cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day. We get more on that from Bloomberg's Joe Matthew in Washington. The Senate is not in session right now. And it's I don't know how much more is going to come from this than messaging. But he does suggest as many have that the Saudis are helping to underwrite Russia's war by maintaining the price of oil. Bloomberg's Joe Matthew reports Mnendez police Saudi Arabia needs to reassess its relationship with Russia in respect to the war. Protest within Iran's oil industry are picking up after refinery workers joined the protest yesterday over the death of a 22 year old woman, Masa Amani.

Keep in mind tomorrow we get a read on NBA mortgage application. But we know these numbers have been slowing. Yeah, they have and that slow down slamming flippers that are hit by a sudden turn when it comes to US prices. The story of I for Sean go Paul covers real estate here for us at Bloomberg after the abrupt end to the US housing boom home flippers who were winning just big months ago are now racing to stem the losses. The doubling of mortgage rates since January is just crushed by our demand where it close to 7% right now Carol and depressed values and investors most favorite locations from Phoenix to Las Vegas to Jacksonville Florida. This is swift turnabout for flippers such as Tammy Morelle who stuck with homes to sell and loans to pay. Here's what Tammy said quote, it's a high risk high reward business and now we're facing the high risk. I'm just praying for a break even this is a full-time flipper in Denver Colorado. Yeah, this is interesting. So America's housing slow down as per Shawn reports is upending the real estate industry and chilling sales as both buyers and sellers pull back.

Pandemic boom areas where affordability has been strained. So flippers make about 14% of transactions, Carol. Right. In those regions in the second quarter, but those shares sank. That's shares sank in July and August. So you've heard it from us before.

Bill Maloney, he's got us covered into here live. Breaking news over your Bloomberg-type squawk, ask you a WK on your terminal. I'm Charlie Palatat. There's a Bloomberg business flat. Charlie, thank you so much. Well, got a question for you, world. What if everything goes wrong at the same time? Could it all get worse, maybe even a lot worse? It's a good question that we should ask our next guest. Yeah, exactly. Fortunately he's with us. He's done a lot of analysis along with Bloomberg team. We're talking about Bloomberg economics chief economist Tom Orle. He is on the phone from our Washington DC bureau. I feel like such a relevant question to be asking on this day. We know we've got a lot of folks meeting in Washington finance chiefs around the world. So tell us about what you and various Bloomberg teams, Tom, set out to do. 2022 has not been a great year for the global economy Carol. We've had rushes, invasion of Ukraine. We've had China locking down. We've had the federal reserve hiking interest rates. And the outlook for 2023 isn't great either. The kind of the lagged impact of a bunch of those shocks is still going to be playing out. So even the baseline forecast for 2023 is pretty pessimistic. Still, the last of the last few years is things can always get worse. So at the danger of confirming everyone's view that economics really is the dismal science. Bloomberg economics have got together and assembled kind of downside risks for the US, China and the Euro area. And then added them up to come to a downside scenario for global growth in 2023. And what that's telling us is, well, even on the base case growth in the next year is going to slow to a range, 2.5%. But if all the downside risks hit at the same time, we could be looking at a global economy going into recession. Tom, is there any good news in this analysis? I mean, there is just a dismal science. So I mean, here's what the downside looks like. The downside is bed tightening tips the US into a recession starting at the end of this year. Europe has a cold winter, a deeper energy crunch and a more painful recession. And China has more COVID outbreaks and a more painful correction in its property sector. But all of these things happening together could tip global growth next year down to minus 0.5% cost the global economy about $5 trillion. So that's the downside. Now what does the upside look like? Well, think about all of those shocks in reverse. Think about a said which achieves the kind of the fabled soft landing, controlling inflation without triggering a recession. Think about Europe having a warmer winter than expected, less than months for gas, gas prices come down. Maybe Europe dodges a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1909,2022-10-11 19:23:37
13684," with out triggering a recession. Think about Europe having a warmer winter than expected. Less demand for gas, gas prices come down. Maybe Europe dodges a recession. And think about a China that gets lucky and manages to escape from COVID-0 without major outbreaks, without major lockdowns. That's the potential upside. If that happens, we'd see stronger growth. And I think for Bloomberg clients as well, we'd be looking at markets being a lot more cheerful. All right, I'm going to take off my rose colored glasses. Well, I would love to think that all of that can happen. I'm not usually a pessimist, but it just seems tricky. And I guess it's interesting, Tom, to be talking about you and your story and the team story on a day where we just heard from the Bank of England Governor Bailey, saying the intervention to end at the end of this week. It's just a reminder that stuff's going to happen. It took the US market down. Things are coming at us constantly as global central banks really struggle with bringing down global inflationary pressures at the same time, probably at the risk of economic growth. It's just not easy right now. We're also trying to manage financial stability in the markets, but at the same time having to be on that mission of bringing down inflation. It's not easy. Yeah, I think that's completely right, Carol. And I think one thing which kind of forecasts for the future, tends to assume is that policy is perfectly executed, right? Fiscal policy gets it right. Monetary policy gets it right. But we're in this really extreme situation right now. We're getting it right. It's actually pretty hard to do. And we saw the UK making this big, unforced error with Chancellor Quasicoyt-Hung, sort of losing the market and triggering that big move in the pound and the big move in the GILTS market. And we saw the Bank of England coming in and say, OK, this is an emergency. We're going to step in and head off risks to financial stability. And then today, Bailey saying, yeah, we stepped in to avoid a crisis. But guess what? That support is time limited. And that night tipping the market into a fresh downturn. And I think all of that just illustrates the fact that getting policy right in this extremely stressful situation when inflation is too high in greater, too weak is tough to do. Hey, Tom, markets, as you know, price in what's coming. And I'm wondering in your interpretation, I know you're an economist and you're not focused on the markets necessarily. But what's your interpretation of what markets have priced in right now? So I think one of the concerns for the markets right now is that they can't see what the bottom is. They know there's more fed tightening coming, but they don't know how high the fed is going to go. They know that Europe has a painful winter ahead, but until they can see what the weather's going to be like and how Russia's going to behave on gas supply, they don't know how painful it's going to be. And they know China has this really difficult adjustment ahead as they exit from COVID-19, but they don't have visibility on it, right? And I think all of these uncertainties are weighing on the market. There's an additional potential upside for the year ahead from a market perspective. If not from an economic perspective, it's we see the depth of the problem right? We have a clear view on where the bottom is. And once we have that clear view, the markets don't have to price in extreme times like scenarios. That could be a trigger for a bit more risk on. Tom Orlick, thank you so much.

Now that they've had to contend with us in Europe, that they're open to what they call an independent contractor plus model. So we may not have you be full-time employees, but hey, we'll throw some benefits your way. Yeah, this is like innovation disruption bumping up against kind of these established models.

This is according to people familiar with the situation. Peloton shares, by the way, down about 5% today. Yes, or as Peloton shares slumped over the past year, Goldman Sachs asked Mr. Foley several times to provide fresh funds or additional collateral for personal loans that the bank had extended to him, this, according to the people that Dow Jones spoke to. The company share prices fallen nearly 95% from its $160 peak that was back in December of 2020. Right now, Trays below nine bucks a share.

This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. Climate change is adding to the danger of severe storms as hurricane in in Florida recently made clear. At America's current approach to flood insurance discourages responsible choices about what gets built and where. When the hybrid public and private insurance market meets current disaster relief potlcy the result is mispriced risk, misallocated investment and amounting toll of suffering and cost. In essence the government is subsidizing people to live places that put them in danger. It's time for a rethink. After climate related disaster strike getting back to normal should no longer be the overriding goal. Help the victims to be sure. But take action so that next time there will be fewer of them.

It has been a long time since we've had them in studio. Can't believe this is the first time I've gotten to meet him in person in two years doing this.

Is this your first time back to the city? It is. Uh, the pandemic here end of February 2020, just as things were starting to erupt. Welcome back. It's good to have you back. It's good to have you back with us. It's a great vibe here in the Bloomberg building as well. Not a great vibe in the markets. No. No. Well, he says on your perspective, I mean, opportunities are being creative for created here for flexible managers. Well, what does that mean? So, so, so, I agree, right? Like when everybody's running for the exits, that's when you find opportunities, much smarter investors than me have said that. And, you know, you're saying it too. So, are you saying that we're near a bottom when it comes to the equity dropout? Or no, but even the selling so far provides some great opportunities? No, I think there's a ways to go. But I mean, the valuations are far better than they were coming into this year. That's especially true for for mid and small company stocks. You know, we track valuations across the landscape and globally. But mid caps and small caps are now somewhat below their long term valuation averages. And we haven't been able to say that for quite a while. So, that that's encouraging. So, I think there's a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1916,2022-10-11 19:54:23
13691," Somewhat below their long-term valuation averages and we have been able to say that for quite a while. So that's encouraging. So I think there's a buying opportunity that is developing. It's not yet there. I mean, if we are going to get one in valuation terms on large caps, we've still got some distance to go. And that's normally the way things unfold in a bear market. As large caps have better liquidity, they tend to be more defensive in nature. They are really the last to fall in a cyclical bear market. And I still think we have that phase ahead of us. But I am encouraged by some of the valuations I see in pockets of the market for a later buying opportunity. What about when it comes to the large caps? When do you think we'll get to a buying opportunity for those? I don't like to get too focused in, really either on time horizon or price levels. I mean, I do think what's going to evolve over the next several months is we'll have the best buying opportunity we've had in the stock market for over a decade. I mean, not back to 2009 levels, but I think it will be a very good buying opportunity. But just in terms of numbers, and again, it's well known that valuations are not a timing tool. But just for some perspective, if we were to put in a bear market low that matched the valuations we saw in March of 2020, which was by far the most expensive bear market low in terms of valuations, we'd still have to sink to 2,900 in the S&P 500. And again, I don't want to get too locked into price levels here because... Right now, PEE on the S&P 500 is about 17 or about 17.5. So still high? Well, we look at, I mean, we certainly look at forward PEEs, but the 2900 was really referring to like the average of multiple different valuations statistics. So we do something akin to what Robert Schiller does with the 10-year PEE. We've been doing it for decades using five-year normalized earnings. Okay. Just adjusting for the fact that earnings dramatically can overshoot as they did in 2021, and then they get crushed during recessions. Let's just try to see through that by smoothing out earnings for the cyclicality of the earnings can have. So on that basis, yeah, we'd have to drop our multiple on the basis of normalized earnings is still around 23. That's a pretty big drop from here. Yeah, well, you'd have to go from 23 to 18 to match, again, what will be the highest valuation we've ever seen. And then we supplement that with work on the price to sales ratio, price to cash flow. Is there anything different about this market environment other than we're coming out of a pandemic that none of us have lived through before? Like, is there something, you know, the old adage, you know, it's different this time around? It's not different this time around. Is there something different about this market environment, though? Well, I mean, the abrupt change in not just monetary policy, but also in fiscal. I mean, just the delta versus a year ago. I mean, we blew out the training 12-month federal deficit to as high as 18% of GDP. Now it's about 4%. And, you know, we all talk about QT and the rate hikes, but the degree of swing in fiscal stimulus has been every bit as great. So, Doug, in terms of the way we're thinking about this moving forward in the federal reserve's role here, how are you looking at the terminal rate? How are you thinking about what the Fed is doing when it comes to tightening in the context of the investment decisions that you're making? We don't necessarily have a forecast, I guess, for where that funds rate might peak. I mean, we are assuming they've already overdone it. And it's the emphasis. They are data dependent. The question is, are they the right data points? I mean, they are co-incident to lagging data points. I mean, our work would say that inflation has probably peaked out. The leading inflation indicator. Is this why you say, Powell, does it need to be vulgar? There are a number of reasons. Well, along those lines, and this is maybe... It's just a bit in with that discussion we just had. I'm trying to take some good notes here, about what Kelli is talking about. Well, why not? This is some good stuff, Carol. That's what they say in the biz. This is some good stuff. Even though we're cautious on the stock market and the economy, we do think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1917,2022-10-11 19:58:34
13692," talking about it. Well, why not? This is some good stuff, Carol. That's what they say in the biz. This is some good stuff. You know, even though we're cautious on the stock market and the economy, we do think that inflation is peaked and it's going to come down significantly. One reason is the stock market itself. It's the negative wealth effect. And Bill Dudley in the spring came very close to like mentioning that term exactly. It's the fact that, you know, we've had a 25 percent stock market decline. The issue is don't think about it just in terms of the percentage decline in the index. Think about how large the stock market was in relation to GDP at its peak coming into this year. It was more than 200 percent of GDP. So this relatively moderate decline is a big deal in terms of the wealth destruction. We never have enough time with you. And I hope you got your notes there Tim. Twenty seconds. So what do you will say we're near bottom? I know you don't really necessarily a number, but what kind of field do we have? You have to be quick. Lower valuations, a big relative crack in the blue chips where small caps and mid caps, they probably still go to new lows, but maybe show some relative strength. So giving and maybe a give up and then we've seen it in the utilities. But when you start to see the defensive crack, that's a sign that people are selling what they can and we may be near a complete capitulation. Did you know? Which I think is still ahead. Did you get your notes? Oh, you'll hear in a couple minutes what I have to say. We love talking with you. So come back anytime. Anytime on phone in person's even better, but safe trips back. Doug Ramsey, Chief Investment Officer at the Luthol Group here in our studio. All right, folks, time to head over to our TV colleagues, our cross platform coverage, radio TV and YouTube. We're counting you down to the close on Bloomberg. Beyond the bell, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross platform coverage of the US market closed, darn it right now. Right now we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Bostic, Caroline High, Taylor Riggs, gotten you down to the closing bell and here to help take us beyond the bell. It's our simulcast with Carol, Master and Tim, Stenevich. We welcome our audiences across Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, as well as on YouTube. Another day here, guys, where we focus on the macro, we focus on financial markets stability. And I guess to a certain extent, we focus on the fundamentals and right now, none of them seem to be looking pretty good. No, exactly. Certainly feels that way. We talk about bouncing around, and we saw some momentum, certainly, to the downside as a result of the news out of the Governor of the Bank of England. But it's just a reminder that stuff comes at us, comes at investors from any perspective and any part of the world. And it's just another reminder that we are certainly global markets and all connected. We just had a great go ahead. No, I'm sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to step on you. That's okay. I can't interrupt people on the show, Taylor. No, very awkward. Very awkward. Very awkward. Excuse me. Who just said that? That's not correct. Exactly. All right. We just took the Doug Ramsey. He was actually in our studio for the first time in what close to three years. It was really great to have him join us. And he made some really interesting comments. He said that he assumes the Fed has already overdone it and that inflation has already peaked and we'll see it come down significantly. He talked a lot about the negative wealth effect. You know, the idea that people feel less wealthy, so they're going to spend less. And which will, of course, decrease consumption. I think that's right. I think when you think of that sort of big picture, the central banks that are finally trying to test the market and say, for the first time really in a decade, Caroline, we're trying to figure out what things are worth. Money isn't free. Nothing is at zero percent. There's consequence. There's downside for the first time in a long time. And that's a conundrum that these markets, I think, are trying to get real. What was it? Tiara. The Ed Campbell just said, funny. There is some sort of an amazing. A reasonable, amazing one. It's cashierful to knife. And we talk about here a kind of the big volatility that we've seen in this market. The Dow Jones industrial average that had been the bright spot on the day. It was up as much as 1.4 percent. It was going to close today only higher by about a tenth of a percent here on the day. I want to point out though, the S&P 500 here, we're down about 7.10 of a percent to close out the session. We're closing in at 3588. Now, remember, we closed below that 3600 level back towards the end of September. But I thought it was interesting this morning. This was actually the first day that we actually opened below 3600 going back to November of 2020. So you talk about the round trip that effectively has been put in place for the S&P 500 as well as the NASDAQ composite, which is down another percent here on the day, back down to that 10,426 level.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1918,2022-10-11 20:03:10
13693," Talk about the round trip that effectively has been put in place for the S&P 500, as well as the NASDAQ composite, which is down another percent here on the day, back down to that 10,426 level. You are seeing some activity in some of those cyclical names, the Russell 2000 going to finish the day higher in the green, but only by about six, by about a tenth of a percent here on the day. It was much higher earlier, but a lot of those macro concerns really kind of scaring people off. Yeah, I feel like all over the place in terms of the market moves today. Right now, though, as we settle in, and we're going to talk about major industry groups, the S&P 500, more risk off, 303 names to the downside today. Taylor, 198 lowered to unchange. So definitely, again, a more of a negative tone today. Yeah, Carol, you see that on a sector levels wall. Take a look at where we're on some of the individual sectors here. There's some red, even in the quote, best performers for a radio audience. We'll make sure to tweet this out to you. Let's start with the winners. There were some. It was defensive in nature. It was sort of an inflationary hedge in nature. It's food and staples, it's durable, it's real estate, it's food and beverage. Those are sort of the sector winners. Unfortunately, Carol, as you mentioned, there was a lot of red and the red gets worse off about two to three percent. It's all those long duration assets with yields rising, technology, software, media, semiconductors, auto components, and the banks are down there as well off about 2.6 percent ahead as some of those earnings that we're going to get on Friday. All right. Here's to some of the individual gainers and we've talked about this throughout the day. American Airlines up at almost 6.7 percent at its highs today, still finishing a gain of about 1.7 percent, rallying after lifting its third quarter sales above prior guidance. So it's talking about revenue in the period expected to be up about 13 percent over the same quarter in 2019, slightly better than their prior outlook of no more than a 12 percent increase. So that was up top in the S&P 500 and now is back 100 micron technology despite pressure on the overall semi space. Micron was up about 4.5 percent. We did a see quite a wipeout yesterday following that Friday news of curbs on China's access to semi technology. So you've got that going on and then Am jet was up almost 6 percent today here at the close, top in the S&P and now is like 100. It's a result of a Morgan Stanley upgrade to overweight from equal weight, highlighting the unappreciated upside in the bio farmers midterm pipeline and the price target raised to 279 from 257. Stop closing at 245 and change today Tim. All right, you've got the gainers. I got the decliner. So let's start with Microsoft. I picked this one yesterday as well. In the last four days, it's actually shed nearly $180 billion in market cap finishing they did down by 1.7 percent today. It was the biggest loser in terms of weight on the S&P 500 and on the NASDAQ 100 today. The information technology sector I should note down 33 percent so far this year at underperforms the nearly 25 percent decline that we're seeing in the S&P 500. Tesla also weighing on the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 down 2.9 percent today. It's down for a fifth consecutive day. It shed about $100 billion of market cap in that time. There was also this news out. It didn't necessarily move the company stock that Elon Musk denied a report that said he spoke directly with Vladimir Putin about Ukraine. He did say he last spoke with Putin 18 months ago and it was not about any sort of war. And then lift finishing they down. Go ahead, Roman. That's swell. Yeah. I was surprised to see this. Was this during the war? No, 18 months ago. Okay. Yeah. Well, the current war. That's the thing to keep in mind. I mean, we know that Russia has annexed other parts of Ukraine and other parts of Ukraine in the past. Well, it's got their own communication. Yeah. Lift down 12 percent today. Among other gig economy companies, Uber finishing the day down about 10 percent, DoorDash also falling. The Biden administration issuing a proposal for a federal rule that would change the way it approaches workers' employment status. That could really change the way that these companies do business. I was a little surprised that the stocks moved this much on this because we've been talking about this for so long. We saw what happened in California. We saw what happened in the UK. But obviously it constantly does. Did you hear the comments from Uber itself kind of saying this is no big deal. This just kind of takes us back to the Obama administration rules. Yeah. Even they're saying it's not that big of a deal, but whatever. We'll see. Well, it's all again is new again. Let's go back to some of the geopolitical risks that have the market upended at the moment. We had, of course, a bit of a rally in the interim of today. Lunchtime we got galvanized into thinking that the dollar should perhaps go lower. And in fact, we've piled back into some of the more risky assets, but then it all dial back again.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1919,2022-10-11 20:07:21
13694," Of course, a bit of a rally in the interim of today, lunchtime we got galvanised into thinking that the dollar should perhaps go lower and in fact we've piled back into some of the more risky assets, but then it all dialed back again largely in part because of Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, coming out and saying, look, you have about three days pension funds to get your house in order before we stop supporting the bond market. Well, it meant that the British pound sunk by three quarters of a percent, it is weaker versus a US dollar, move back into the haven, that is Bloomberg Dollar Index that gains some two tenths of a percent. We see across the board the sell-off that goes into the commodity space. That has actually been resolute all day. We are worried more about geopolitical risks, Pat, worried about Ukraine and Russia and indeed that has an impact on the wheat market today. But oil is on the downside is we worry more about those global recession threats, the talk coming from the IMF, WTI, of by 1.9 percent overall. Brent crude is down 2.7 percent and in fact when you see metals that we've been selling off as well. And I look at a sovereign bond market that if the UK had been open we'd see a big move I'm sure in guilt so we heard from Andrew Bailey after that market had shut. But indeed we did start to see overall in the days trade a movement out of certain of the markets Japanese yet yield had been pushing higher so to a Norwegian on the back probably of the oil move tailor. We're seeing a huge sort of inflationary narrative. Caroline when you think about full faith in credit, again another relentless climb higher. It's not the big sort of double digit moves that we've seen but you're still getting 6 to 7 basis points across the curve. Yesterday of course because the bond markets were closed outside of that again four straight days of this move higher. I wonder about the correlation with the now stack that's now been lower for five straight days and the impact rising yields again are having on the equity markets. All right so now our shift I guess is to some of the economic data points coming up. We got PPI tomorrow. We've got the FOMC meeting minutes and it'll be interesting as we kind of go through those minutes how we put that against what we've heard from Fed commentary and I'm thinking about some of the back and forth you've got Cleveland feds, Loretta Mester you know talking about a lot more hawkish. You also have different people saying they're concerned about stressing the financial markets others saying expect some volatility that's what's going to happen. It's kind of this back and forth if you will. Yeah but I mean we don't think anything is actually going to change before the next Fed meeting. This is kind of the last most important data point for the Fed. I'm talking about Thursday's CPI report or the last CPI report that we have before the Fed's meeting on November 2nd. And you know everybody's just saying 75 basis points that's the traders are betting on and that's seemingly what Fed speakers are saying. Well AI and I mean there's really nothing I guess to knock them off that pivot. I mean you talk about the PPI numbers tomorrow the idea that you know we're going to be what above 8% on the headline but even on a core basis above 7 that's basically what's in the pipeline presumably coming to consumers unless of course some of these companies want to eat the costs but how many companies have we already heard basically say look we're raising prices and at least for now consumers seem to be taking them. So what does that mean then for the CPI number it's you know as Taylor would say you know it's second order first order what is it fifth order effects. It's the first derivative second. First derivative okay all right and also well what is the 17% by 6% or 7% What does that mean? All right well we've got a lot to talk to and we'll continue tomorrow all right right now we're going to head back to the annual JP Morgan Robin Hood Investorist conference Bloomberg Shanali Basik sitting by with the key voice Shanali over to you. Thank you team welcome to our Bloomberg television and radio audiences I'm standing by with Barry Stern like T the CEO and founder of Outstar with Capital Group and what a time to talk to you at a time of rising interest rates a lot of jitters in the market you're here at Robin Hood right now what's the sentiment like is it negative is it a group of people who are ready to start to dip their toes in the water out of greater rate. I would say in general I've been surprised that I wouldn't call it optimism but there's a weird optimism is the group of professional investors and people really interested in the market and ideas and everybody's looking for things to do smart things to do and and I think the overall sentiment everyone's sort of looking at each other and saying everyone's so negative that maybe that's a positive like the sentiment is so bad and even everybody knows the S&P earnings are too high everybody knows GDP growth rates estimates for next year are too high so the question is when is the market going to say when is it discounted when have you sold your securities in anticipation of that happening and some people say okay the bad news it's going to get worse and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1920,2022-10-11 20:11:36
13695," Opportunity and distress in particular is something that is around the corner. Absolutely. This is a bunch of minefields, right? This is like, you're going to hear about, that's why I'm so agitated about this, because we're creating this collateral damage. I kind of liken it to, there were really smart things people did, and there were healthy fish in the pond, and then these stupid things people did. And they were idiot investments. And for whatever reason, they called it the democratization of finance, which means you didn't have any idea what you were doing, but you were taking on professionals that did things like look at the quality, the company, or the quality, the management. And so you thought the healthy fish would survive, and the sick fish would die, but the Fed is draining the entire pond. So everyone's going to die. And so it's going to happen over time. You'll hear about explosion here and explosion there, and explosion here, and explosion there, and you're really stepping into a minefield. And the Fed, you know, what people don't realize is the Fed has frozen the banking system. Not just in the US, but globally. So liquidity is drying up in the banks, and then the shadow banks are, you know, are confused on that, but they're also nervous. So without liquidity in the system, you know, not only are they raising rates, but they're obviously selling bonds at the same time. It's the fastest rise in rates in history. I think I just get angry at people who said the Fed needs credibility to fight inflation. Wait, you'll get what you want. You'll get this recession. It's definitely coming. Sorry, actually, you're here. The two quarters negative already, but you will see, look what's happening. Look at Nike. Look at AMD. Look at Target. Look at FedEx. I mean, you're, this isn't your normal market. This isn't like things are running away. Well, what about, let's, let's, you know, we can talk all day about what this means for investors. And we will, but let's talk for a second about what this means for the real economy. Because you're in the residential space. We reported a little. A lot of spaces. Yeah, you're in all the spaces. And, you know, you've, you've sold, we reported that you've been selling earlier this year. What does this mean for residential as opposed to commercial in the next year or so, especially as Americans are already dealing with inflation. Their mortgage rates are going up. Yeah, and they're, you know, most Americans have fixed rate mortgages. So that's a good, good news item. They're not going to be squeezed by increasing rate interest rates, which is actually, I was kind of surprised about that. Most people have fixed rate mortgages. I think it's like 60% of the market. 10% have floating rate. They're going to get hurt. And 30 or 40% of people have no mortgage at all. So they won't really have any impact. But it means people can't move. If you have fixed rate mortgage and it's a 3%, you're not going to move to a house, new house, which is a 7% mortgage. You're going to be stuck, which is why new home sales are plummeting. I also think people are nervous, should be nervous about their jobs, you know. One of the funniest things, it's not a funny thing. It's, I just just say this because I haven't, haven't articulated it before. But I think global wealth is down like 36 trillion in the stock market. I think the US is probably 10. Well, $10 trillion at the lowest capital gains rate was $2 trillion of taxes the government just lost the revenue. By him raising interest rates how he has, he's cost the US Treasury $2 trillion. At the same time, he's knocked rates up 100 basis points now, 300 basis points off the floor. That's almost a trillion dollars of interest expense on 31 trillion dollars of debt. So what are we going to do? We're going to print more money. And that's going to force rates up. So rates are going to drift higher without him having increased rates any further. And the further he goes, the more money we're going to have to print to pay the interest expense on the existing 31 trillion of debt. So it's really a dangerous game he's playing and he's killing the economy and will take people out of jobs and will put them on unemployment benefits. And then we'll have to give them unemployment benefits when they were, when we were taxing their incomes before. You were talking about corporate balance sheets a little bit earlier. You know, what are you factoring for? Where does the terminal rate really stand for you? And how does that, how is that something that you're baking into your future investments here? Let's go back to the real economy for a second because I kind of lost your question. I mean, the housing market, long term is a very solid market. Both apartments and homes will be fine long term. We just have to get through this period. Apartments are occupied, rents are healthy, rent growth is still healthy in certain markets. The office markets are the question in the US, but they're still absorption the office markets. And I just returned from a trip to Singapore and Tokyo and Seoul and everyone's in the office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1921,2022-10-11 20:19:09
13696," or the question in the US, but there's still absorption in the office markets. And I just returned from a trip to Singapore and Tokyo and Seoul and everyone's in the office. I mean, they are back full fledged in the office. This 50% occupancy of office is really a US thing. And I think it'll change in a slowdown. I think people, CEOs, I was listening to Sam Bankman, Fried earlier. And they're all in the office. They said, how many days a week? He said six and a half. I'm like, yes. That's how I do your that. But he said, you know, even for him, he said that productivity suffers when the team isn't together, especially doing creative things. And I find that we're all in the office. And I find that people come voluntarily. I don't have to ask them to come in. So let's roll back a little bit here because you're talking about the distressed opportunity, that potentially being right around the corner. Where exactly are you talking about? Well, in the real estate world, there'll be people having loans coming due. There might be hard to refinance. And so they're going to need a capital infusion where they have the money in their own. Strong players like us and Blackstone, Brookfield, we have funds that can pay down debt if we need to to save good assets. A lot of people won't have those opportunities. And the banks will probably look at these loans and say, we can either foreclose on these borrowers or we can sell them alone. So I think and let someone else worry about taking back the asset, the banks are in the business of releasing office buildings or repopulating hotels, or working on marketing plans. The banks are in so much better condition. They were in 0708. My guess is they won't, we call it pretend and extend before. They were allowed to do that in 0708. They were allowed to basically not mark down those assets to fair value the government wanted the banks to be able to recapitalize themselves. And this time, I think the banks will be tougher. And because they're in much better capital positions and they can take the hits. But I think you'll see a lot of loans for sold being sold. And like I said, it's all the fish. Like it's every asset class. Every asset, there's no asset class in any industry. Forget about real estate, that's immune to these much higher rates. And it's not just what the Fed is doing with interest rates because on top of that, when we borrow, we borrow the spread above so far, the low rate. And those spreads have more than doubled because of the uncertainty in the market. So a triple A might have priced, let's say, a 100 basis point, or 1% above the reference rate of LIBOR, the government's borrowing rate. And today that could be 250. So it's not just the base rate. It's the spread, but total cost of refinancing has gotten pretty expensive. What about abroad? You started to touch on this a little earlier. The market is really reacting very strongly to what you're seeing happen in the UK across the world. So you're saying that this is partially the Fed impacting the rest of the world. But there are issues happening elsewhere. And there are really a lot of worries baking about which risk here. Inflation in the US, you mentioned LIBOR. LIBOR is tight. And there's still even though the number of open jobs dropped, 1.1 million unprecedented number in the last report, which the Fed should notice. We still have 9 million jobs that are not occupied. And part of it's our labor force, which has patient rate is strong. But in Europe, inflation is almost 100% the energy situation. And if you could somehow cure that, you talk about an upside. If Putin was kicked out of power and his backfires on him, the markets would have a field day. I mean, in Europe would be fine. And the hundreds of billions of dollars they're going to write to their customers and their small businesses and individuals to support their energy bills in this time of crisis across northern Europe, it's a lot of money. They wouldn't have to spend. And it's put enormous pressure on those economies. And we're hotels in the UK. The bill was $80,000. This year will be $800,000. We put out for the electricity bill. We put out bids for our energy contracts. And two of the seven utilities bid. The other five don't even want to play. So in the UK, what they did that precipitated this recent crisis is they put the floor to the pedal to the floor on fiscal stimulus by basically saying, we're going to cut taxes. And all this on people say, whoa, we're trying to fight inflation. How could you try to stimulate the economy? So I'm going to make sense to come in and say, support the pound. It's like you're being on the pedal, the break, and the accelerator, full out at the same time. And the markets went, whoa, you can't do that. And this is crazy. And it is absolutely insane what they tried to do. And they're timing of it in the middle of a crisis. What are the lasting effects of it as somebody who operates in the region? I mean, so look, one of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1922,2022-10-11 20:23:25
13697," And it is absolutely insane what they tried to do. And they're timing of it in the middle of a crisis. What are the lasting effects of it as somebody who operates in the region? Well, I mean, so look, one of the most interesting things is how currencies have moved and how will change flows of capital and how that will affect different asset classes. So for example, the pound at 110, hit I think 104, that's the morning I saw it was 110, tourism, right? View bio hotel in the UK, it will be full. Guaranteed, there'll be a zillion people there. Americans were all over Europe this summer and they'll be all over the UK. And they'll not only be staying hotels, but they'll probably be shopping at all the stores and buying everything. It was like nice time to buy an apartment in the UK. And I think for the people who have all the money today, which typically other oil producing nations really that have benefited from the rising global prices and they can go on a global shopping spree. And they probably don't have a lot of competition. There's a lot of money in Asia still. But the American investors, the pension plans here, they're all facing lower, they've lost a lot of money in stock market and the bond market. So they're not rich as they were, they'll still have contributions, but the real money now is shifted to the Middle East and to some other sovereigns like the new Japanese. Now let's come back to the United States for a second because there's another huge thing just happening really days away and that's the US midterms. How do you think that's going to change the calculus for investors? What are you watching for? Are there certain areas that you were looking at more than others? How is the second? You know, as split government right now, I think would be good for investors. So if you have the Republicans taking or getting the House, keeping the Senate or the Democrats taking the Senate or probably taking the House, or the Republicans having a sweep and you have Biden in the White House, a freeze of government doing anything really dumb right now is probably healthy for us to get to the presidential election. So I think the best outcome is probably a split economy. I guess maybe they'll compromise and do some smart things and focus on things that matter to the nations instead of some of the nonsense they spend all their time on these days, including the energy policy. You know, getting solar, I was listening to a presentation today, Robinhood, about how solar is so powerful as a source and so cheap that energy prices could go to zero. That was actually a presentation by Co-Too this morning, whether it's right or wrong, it's certainly exciting and something the government should definitely put investment behind. And they did a little with Biden's energy act or renewables bill, which I think he called the deficit reduction bill, which was really clever marketing. But I think those are important things the government can do at times like this. I'm not, I'm agnostic, you know, I just think we need leadership and I think some of the, it's a very weird time because you have politics, you have geopolitics, you have the economy, you have everything sort of in play at once, you have the China situation, you have relations with China. And Biden is certainly up the ante. I mean, he is definitely whether it's the chips or Taiwan or Pelosi's visit. I mean, you have, you have a lot of things actually that are making investors uncomfortable. Well, real quick last question for you here. You know, we've reported this morning that a company that you've backed, Spac-related company, everyone talks about Spac's as though it's the market that's fully died off, it's in talks with CVS for an acquisition. Has the SPAC market totally failed? Or is it something that you see? There are a lot of IPOs that were done the same times that Spac's were doing, there are M&A activities. The SPAC, there was some bad actors over buying bad companies. The street was in Discrimination and who they backed. You know, you're talking about Cannot Healthcare, which is a real company with $3 billion in revenues and is more than double this revenue since we took it public in the SPAC structure. The SPAC in itself was not a bad vehicle, but there were a lot of dumb things that got done. And they threw all the baby out with a bath water. I have a chart of SPACs on my phone actually. And I'm watching, everything's a $2. So so many are $3. And some of them are really good companies and they have great prospects, others are frauds. And they've gone one of them's at seven cents that the company had passed at. I think it's three cents this morning. So anyway, there were a lot of bad IPOs done at the same time because the banks were trying to compete against this SPAC.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1923,2022-10-11 20:27:39
13698, frauds and they've gone one of them's at seven cents of company I passed out I think it's three cents this morning so anyway there are a lot of that IPO's done at the same time because the banks were trying to compete against these spacks and I won't name names but there's some there's some IPO's in the same period that are down more than these spacks well we will come back to you as you're watching navigate this market very strongly thank you so much for your time that is the CEO and founder of starwood capital group back to you all right genali of course Bloomberg genali boss like there with Barry star and like talking about a lot of things and you can catch that interview certainly on bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg terminal so much going on today everyone and of course a lot more to come this week but that's going to do it for our cross platform coverage on radio tv and youtube we will see you again same time same place tomorrow you're listening to bloomberg business week with carol master and bloomberg quick takes Tim's deniving on Bloomberg radio.

13699," because you guys are in expansion mode, which is definitely not the same thing as other companies that are out there right now that are pulling back a little bit. Absolutely. You know, it's an interesting time. There is, without question, we are dealing with complicated macroeconomic issues on a global scale. But we do feel there's a bifurcation between best in class brands that are leaders in their categories, that are innovating, and folks that are maybe called middle of the pack, more legacy mass market brands that are seeing growth really slow as a result of this inflationary environment that we're in. We feel very fortunate to be experiencing dynamic growth this year. I feel our customer, our relationship with our customer, has never been stronger. We're excited about Q4 and holiday. When we look towards 2023, we are being optimistic, but cautiously optimistic. We are planning for another year of dynamic growth. We are going to continue to expand our fleet of retail stores. But we're not trying to swing for the fences. We want to lock in a number that we're really content with, not over-invest in the business, and be responsible with our growth. Because there are some macro factors that we're watching very closely. And we just don't know how things will go. No, and it's interesting, too. I think at the time about a year ago of that soft bank investment, which was just about a year ago, it was a report that you plan to open to more than 100 stores in the US over five years. So as you look at those macro concerns, has that number been reduced or that plan that forecast been changed? You know, it hasn't actually, you know, the performance of our stores today has never been stronger. We're still very bullish on our vertical retail expansion, you know, four-wall contribution payback, still best in class. And you know, we're in a unique position. Because, you know, relative to the size of the market, the oil is still very much early stage. You know, we're in our seventh year of selling in market. And there's a lot of opportunity to gain market share as we grow into the years that comes. So while we might be in a more challenged macro environment, I think that will be counter-punced by the growth and taking market share from some of the other more established players. So talk to subat growth metrics. We're Bloomberg, we're nerdy. We love all these numbers. So talk to subat top and bottom line growth. Give us an idea, same store sales growth. What have you guys been seeing? Yeah, I mean, this year we're seeing, you know, the business is going to grow north of 70%. You know, between 70 and 80% top line. At a pretty sizable scale, it's a number that we're very proud of. You know, our same store sales are still copying very strong over prior years. Demonstrating, you know, that, you know, it's still very much early in our awareness curve. People are experiencing the brand. We're converting them into loyalists. They're shopping with us for years to come while acquiring more new customers. So we see really great year over year growth in our existing fleet. And then, you know, as we expand the network across the country, you know, we're leveraging e-commerce data so we can be really in there. We go and we tend to open strong. And I think that that trend is really accelerating as the brand builds more and more awareness. Joe, how are you doing with inventory right now? We saw inventory challenges, of course, from Nike just in the last couple of weeks, not to mention, you know, companies that we can't necessarily compare you to, like Target, for example, how are you managing inventory? Yeah, it's a great question. You know, we have definitely seen impacts from this complicated supply chain environment. Although we are seeing it begin to normalize, especially on the logistics side of the supply chain, you know, getting your product in containers, getting it on boats and delivering on time, that has become much more normalized, the cost of a container, you know, from Asia to the west coast of the United States, you know, pre-pandemic was, you know, called it $2,500 to $3,000. It went up the highest $18,000. Now back to pre-pandemic levels or materially close to pre-pandemic levels.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1925,2022-10-11 20:36:13
13700," you know, call it $2,500 to $3,000. It went up the highest $18,000. Now back to pre-pandemic levels or materially close to pre-pandemic levels. So the logistics aspects of supply chain have normalized where we're still seeing a lot of challenges in the ability to source raw materials and get them delivered to your factory partners on time. So what happened to the larger marketplaces, you know, your spring deliveries delivered late that created promotion as we transitioned from spring and summer into fall. And then you saw the same thing happen, you know, and it was a double whammy with the deliveries of fall being material delayed for a lot of our peers. And that's putting a lot of pressure on inventory levels. That's why a lot of folks anticipate highly promotional holiday coming up. Viewer-y, while we're not immune to these challenges, we've stayed very close to our supply chain. We've dealt with delays, but nothing that's been cat-strophic. And we've been able to maintain our full price business, which has been a goal of ours since we launched in the spring of 2015. And we don't anticipate an overly promotional holiday. So you probably know better than anybody else, the competition that's out there, whether it's, you know, those giant brands, including Nike, you've got Lulu Lemon, you've got Under Armour. I mean, it's a super competitive market that could be on track for some slowing growth because, you know, what we're seeing is people are going back to the office. I've stopped wearing my yoga pants during work. You know, I'm back wearing, you know, what I would call growing up clothes in a big way. So tell us, you know, how, what's the competitive advantage that gives you the optimism that you can continue on your growth trajectory? Yeah, I think I can go with those guys. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great point, you know, and it's interesting when we launched the brand, we were facing this competition, and we saw nothing but open space. And I think it's due to our product positioning, our brand positioning, the ethos of the brand, which is built to move in style for life. And it all comes down to building product that will support you in a workout, but it'll transition and work across multiple aspects of your life. And so we prioritize fabrications that have performance at their core, but they're incredibly soft. We design all of our products with a more modern athletic fit that works across multiple aspects of your life. And we design our products with an aesthetic, a color story that is sophisticated that doesn't identify you as somebody going to the gym or going to compete in a sport, but it just, again, works across multiple aspects of your life. That was always the premise of the brand. And we applied it first and foremost to active wear product that you would move and sweat in. But the brand has really evolved. And when you look at our assortment and where we're growing, it's evolved from core fitness into outdoor, which is rooted in outerwear. And the fastest growing segment of our brand is travel commute, which is taking lessons, those technical fabrications and constructions that we applied to active wear and applying it to everyday sportswear. And that's one of the fastest growing segments of our collection. And those are the products that you're wearing to the office. You're wearing the travel. You're wearing on the golf course. And so I think our vision to build a more well-rounded collection that speaks to multiple aspects of your life is really benefiting us as you see the preferences of the consumer change. Joe, there are a couple of different directions that it seems like the company could go at this point in terms of trajectory. One of them is the Lulu Lemon route, where you go public. Another one, and forgive me, but this has happened before. I think of a company like Outdoor Voices, which, you know, five years ago, was the talk of the town and has gone through several CEO transitions and a New York Times profile that essentially said that it imploded after raising about $50 million in funding. How do you avoid the fate of a company like Outdoor Voices? It all comes down to your people, incredible leadership, alignment of your people, but higher talent to people that are much better than yourself. That's been our ethos from day one is building an incredible, incredible team that can see around those corners, you know, and prioritizing making incredible products. You know, we are maniacal about our product, our level of service, you know, the NPS scores in our stores are off the charts. And I think that's the most important thing, you know, it's hard comparison, you look at a brand like Outdoor Voices.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1926,2022-10-11 20:40:34
13701," our level of service, the NPS scores in our stores are off the charts. And I think that's the most important thing. It's hard comparison. You look at a brand like outdoor voices in Fiori. I wasn't great at raising capital in the early days, admittedly. I didn't have a background building and a peril business. And so the little capital that I did get, I had to make it stretch a long way. And so we prioritized the basics of business, the fundamentals of acquiring customers profitably from day one. And we built a business that was profitable from early stage. And we never had to sacrifice that profitability for growth over the years. And I think that's why Fiori received one of the highest private market apparel valuations ever is because we've been able to demonstrate a commitment to growth, doing it profitably, and also responsibly with our commitment to ESG and making decisions that prioritize the planet as we're building. Which is an important part increasingly for consumers. We know that they look at what a company stands for. Their impact on the environment. Hey, Joe, just before we wrap up, so what's the end game here? Is it ultimately to go public at some point? I think that could be a viable outcome. Right now, we're very heads down building the business. We're having a lot of fun. I'm a young man. I've got a lot of energy for the business. We've got big plans for growth, both here in the US as well as abroad. And so today, that's what we're focused on. But we want to optimize the business and provide the best return for our shareholders. A public offering could be a viable option down the road. All right, we're going to leave it on that. Now, great stuff. Joe, and stay in touch so that we can hear more as you guys continue to grow the business here in the US and certainly outside. They're based in Incinitas, California, which is the best place in the world. OK? Yeah. Somebody from Southern California, and Incinitas is great. I know you're kind of talking your book there, Tim Stenevich. All right, Joe Kudla. Thank you so much. Founder and CEO, Viori, joining us on the phone in New York City. And if you missed any of that conversation, be sure to check out our Bloomberg Business Week podcast a little bit later on. Let's get over to some world and national news. We got Nancy Lyons, Denny Byron, and 991 newsroom in DC. Hey, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. Actress Angela Landsbury has died. She was one of TV's favorite sleuths and murder she wrote. And she also played the tea pot Mrs. Potts and the animated Beauty and the Beast. Taylor's all this time. Song has all this rhyme. Beauty and the beauty. Her children say, Dame Landsbury died peacefully in her sleep just five days shy of her 97th birthday. Several NATO allies, including the US, say they will shore up Ukraine's air defenses in response to the latest Russian missile barrage against civilian targets. This is Secretary General Yen Stoltenberg in Brussels. Our message is clear. NATO stands with Ukraine for as long as it takes. Stoltenberg was speaking ahead of tomorrow's defense ministers meeting in Brussels. Well, we may be four weeks away from a midterm election, but abortion rights advocates are looking ahead to 2024. The advocates are looking at introducing ballot measures to enshrine abortion rights in at least a dozen state constitutions, including a few led by Republicans where restrictive abortion laws are already on the books. Supporters may be feeling momentum after Kansas voters approved an abortion rights amendment, but the Washington Post reports some are advising caution. Ballot measures can take years to plan and cost millions of dollars, and some GOP-led states are trying to make it harder to put constitutional amendments on the ballot in the first place.

Find out how at SEI.com slash IMS. Alright you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. We're getting ready to ramp up our show but we've got a great last guest that we wanted to get to. And just to kind of set it up earlier this year McKinsey pegged the price tag of a livable climate at $9.2 trillion a year. So that's the level of investment needed to reach the international climate goals of net zero emissions by 2050. And our next guest, Tim, as a guide to the risks and opportunities for investors as a world faces climate change. Very pleased to have with us this afternoon Bruce Usher. He's professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School. He's also the author of his book investing in the era of climate change. And I should note full disclosure he was my professor when I took a course from him all the way back in what maybe 2017, 2018 at Columbia Business School. Climate change didn't exist right? Yeah this was a cool class investing for social ventures. We got to like essentially serve as consultants for these startups and decide whether or not they would be awarded money. Professor Usher great to have you with us this afternoon. How are you? Thank you for having on the show and nice chat again. Yeah it's good to have you with us. Hey help us understand in a time where we're seeing global upheaval the worst energy crisis that we've actually seen in decades. And investors are fighting for returns anywhere. How should they be thinking about investing when it comes to climate change? Well there's no shortage of volatility in the market these days, but they should think about climate change from a longer term perspective. They're looking for stable trends was going to be here with us for years if not decades and affecting businesses for decades to come. And therefore affecting investors and investor returns for years to come. Climate change is the macro trend of the next several decades. It's just not question about that. So okay and I do feel like it's going through a reckoning to Tim and I talk about ESG right. We've seen so much money professor Usher go into this space, but we're getting to a point where people really want to understand what they're investing in and that that money. Ultimately makes a difference when it comes to ESG metrics, but how do we make sure that investments that we make really are making a difference and are good for the climate? Well there's plenty of discourse or any ESG these days, no question about that. And the challenge of the ESG is the concept is very simple right. It's simply saying that when you make an investment you would normally look at financial metrics and manage metrics and competition all these other metrics. In addition, add to that analysis the environmental or social factors that are material to the company you're considering. If you're buying it to real estate on the coast, you might want to think about floods and storms in the life right. So that's ESG analysis is very important investment perspective. It makes for better investment decisions. It doesn't have a tremendous impact though on addressing climate change because what you're really doing is investing in companies that are doing better for managing climate risk. But those decisions don't necessarily reduce emissions of the gas. So that's what you're focused on. I think it's pretty important to be focused on it. There's really two strategies. You can say there one is a thematic impact investing strategy pick a theme or sector that contributes to addressing climate change say renewable energy solar wind or electric vehicles and put some investments into that sector. In a smart way to maximize risk and risk to get just to returns and also contribute to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. The other strategy that's unique to really high net worth ultra high net worth individuals is take what's called impact first strategy. So here we're really focused.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1928,2022-10-11 20:49:17
13703," The other strategy that's unique to really high net worth or ultra high net worth individuals is take what's called impact first strategy. So here we're really focused on climate change and invests with that lens in mind. Now that means they can very long term investments and then perhaps an additional risk. But some investors are going to that as well. What I find a little puzzling in this day and age in, you know, October of 2022 is the market has rewarded this year. Companies that are the antithesis of these climate friendly companies you could argue, right? Oil and gas companies. I mean, you look at the best performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. Occidental patrolling up about 120%. Now, for the first third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth companies that are the best performing in the S&P 500, they are all oil, gas, natural resources companies. So what's an investor to do in this environment? So two things they buy with oil and gas. First of all, they were, that was very well price points a year ago, right? So the multiples on those companies is still very low. Secondly, many of those oil and gas companies are aware of climate change and aware of their business models and how they're going to change them. So Occidental patrolling as an example has invested heavily in direct air capture and some other technologies to ideally reduce their emissions over time. They're also thinking long-term. I'm not saying where their business model is the right one. Actually, we don't have much clarity on the oil and gas strategies around climate change yet, but it's not as if those companies are ignoring the issue altogether, at least the best majority of them are now taking action on that. That being said, you know, I said a few minutes ago, climate change is a long-term trend and what we're seeing in the markets right now is short-term volatility, right? Oil gas prices erupt dramatically in the past year and those stocks are going to well in the short term. But is there going to be, you know, it's interesting on a day when we heard from Kathy Wood of ArcInVast too, obviously, stresses, disruption, innovation? You know, is there going to be this uncomfortable pivot for giving me for using the P word? You have to drink now. But is there going to be an uncomfortable pivot, at least in the public markets, as we do shift away from carbon-based fuels as we move to alternative energy more EVs because we really are turning our backs on companies that have been so much a part of our public markets in some ways and there will be new leaders in the market. So will there be some dislocations, some discomfort as that happens? Absolutely. OK. Absolutely. Look, climate change is too much, right? The second word is change. Yeah. And there's going to be environmental change, but there's also going to be a lot of change in business as this decarbonation takes place through the global economy. There are going to be companies that are winners and companies that are losers. There's just no question about that. From an investment perspective, a key question, of course, is who's going to win and who's going to lose? And here it gets a little challenging because in some sectors, the disruptive companies, new technologies, really have an advantage. I mean, just look at the automotive sector in Tesla. It's completely disrupted. And we saw them to value it for both in Tesla and in competitors. Some other sectors of the incumbents have big advantages. And sectors where there's a lot of regulation or big balances are required. For example, utility sector. You know, there are companies that have tried to disrupt utilities for a number of years now. Next era, took a look at what's going on, starting investing heavily in renewables, is now the largest owner of renewable energy assets in the country. And more importantly, is the most valuable utility in the country, the most valuable energy covers utility. So picking those winners and losers as this transition happened, user word pivot, I would use the word transition, but this change is critical. How much do you watch? It's funny. When Tib and I were at milk and was it in the spring? It was May. Yeah. You know, we spent so many of our conversations talking about the private markets versus the public markets. How much do you watch what's going on, especially when it comes to disruption, innovation, that pivot that's happening as we think about the climate? How much of what we really should be keeping an eye on is where those investments are going on in the private markets to give us an idea of who will be ultimately the leaders in the public markets in the years to come. Absolutely. The private markets where a lot of the innovation occurs as we're venture capital flows. So just forぐ.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1929,2022-10-11 20:53:37
13704," This is an idea of who will be ultimately the leaders in the public markets in the years to come. Absolutely. The private markets where a lot of innovation occurs as for venture capital flows. That's where a lot of private capital is flowing from from high-knit individuals. We should look at what's going to look at what Bill Gates and Breakthrough Energy Ventures are investing in. Look at what's a number of the VC funds are putting into a figure out called climate tech. And let's see, which of those become the winners in the various sectors. As I would focus on green hydrogen, whole new sector could absolutely revolutionize a lot of industries today. Direct-air capture, much riskier, much harder, but could revolutionize the way we address climate change. And then there are a whole lot of other technologies around energy storage and transportation. All early stage, not competitive commercially yet with the incumbent companies, but a lot of opportunity and promises. So don't make fun of, I don't know, Rivian or like whoever's out there, right? We love you, Rivian. No, I'm just saying no, no view at all, but I mean, there's going to be stumbles, right, as we make this change. Absolutely. Yeah, look at the parallel here, I teach a business school, right? And if we go back 30 years, I graduate from business school, the big thing that came, and we didn't see it coming, really, was technology. Technology changed all businesses, and we looked at television. Even we saw technology coming. It was often hard to know which companies we're going to win. You know, Netscape was the biggest internet company in there for a while and doesn't exist anymore. Google Pay them along and it's still dominant. Those changes in the world of technology and specifically digital technologies have revolutionized business in so many ways and result in a lot of change. We look for 30 years, that's climate change. Climate change is going to have a similar impact on businesses. And it's tough to predict which specific companies you're going to come on at all. Bruce, where is the drive going to come from when you think about investors, when you think about just business risk, where you think about the government? Is this something that these companies are going to do on their own or just the government need to step in and create regulations that guide them? Yeah, so this is an interesting moment. The reason why I wrote the book now, I could have been working in second 20 years, I could have written it some years ago, or wait a little longer. We're at a very interesting moment in time here because there's multiple drivers going out once, right? One of your drivers at physical risk of climate change are manifesting themselves, increasingly where seeing climate change play out physically is that that affects people. Consumers are starting to demand more sustainable products, employees, they want to work for companies they believe are sustainable. These are all real trends and there's a lot of economic research to show that these actually affect the businesses. Then you've got government stepping up more than ever. It's not consistent particularly here with parties change. The inflation reduction acts by far the largest government support ever in this area and that's as big implications. The greatest change of all is around innovation. We have products like solar and wind and electric vehicles that are revolutionizing industries and also really starting to bend the curve on emissions. Here in the US, most people are real ice. We actually peaked in our greenhouse gas emissions back in 2007. We actually aren't a delicate curve, not nearly quickly enough. We have to accelerate this transition. This innovation and technology is really making a big difference. We have about a minute or so left here and there's a line in your story with a graphic or a picture. Investors should climate proof their investments by mid-century in line with the recommendations of climate scientists. I'm thinking about our investors, people who are listening to this show, listening to you speak, listening to this interview, what's the take away? At this point, when they think about their investments and maybe their strategy, their time frame and the like. So the initial reaction that may be, well, mid-century is an awful long time, but now it's almost three decades and I'm going to be pretty old. Hold on, hold on, still here talking to you then. But investments are priced. They're valued on future cash flows and future expectations are on the value in those assets and those companies. And it's becoming increasing apparent that the world is going to decarbonize. By the way, whether or not governments make it happen is going to happen. Those climate change spaces, the physics went down to it and physics went up. So you're looking at your investments, think about how they're going to be affected not 30 years from now. And they're going to get affected in that couple years as these change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1930,2022-10-11 20:57:52
13705," Physics is going to force us to do this. So you're looking at your investments. Think about how they're going to be affected not 30 years And I would have they're going to get affected in the last couple of years as these changes really start to manifest themselves and then reposition about that Fascinating and I think just so relevant to so much going on especially as we continue to see the impact of climate change and then think about how it plays Certainly into investing strategy Bruce.

13706," From the heart of where innovation, money, and power collide. In Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Jay. I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up in the next hour. Our tech stocks turn sharply lower as the semiconductor slowdown takes the industry down with it. We're going to have more on the warnings from chip makers and when we might see a recovery. Plus, the gig economy faces a new reality after the Labor Department proposes some gig workers be classified as employees, sending shares of Uber down more than 15%. We're going to talk about what it means for Uber Lift, DoorDash, and more. And we get a glimpse into Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the metaverse. The company is leaning into the virtual workplace with new partnerships with Zoom and Microsoft. Zuckerberg also unveiling the new Quest Pro headset and showing off his avatar legs. All that in a moment but first let's get a look at the markets with Bloomberg's Taylor Riggs and Taylor Ouch tech. Going from bad to worse here. Yeah Emily, sort of feels like deja vu when I stood here in front of you yesterday. It was sort of another day of some significant pressure for the general major averages. And away as you can see here in S&P and NASDAQ and the chip makers again as you mentioned in that introduction. Off another two and a half percent and yes yields. The bond market reopened today but yields are climbing and that is also putting further pressure on some of those long duration assets as well. Change up the board and I wanted to mention a lot about the chip makers Emily to kick you off for the show. A four day losing streak here now for the socks. That is the big chip maker index underway. Some of the worst sort of losing streak that we've had within the last four days alone. You're now looking at a 12% sell off. I know that you'll dive deeper into that story but really further fall out from more of the restrictions around the chip makers and what it means for some of that business and that revenue of course in China. Flip out the board and I wanted to also sort of broaden out and take a look at the NASDAQ 100. Now this was a five day losing streak for the NASDAQ and the NASDAQ 100. Some of the worst losing streak that we've seen this year and again taking out some of the key technical levels as well when you think about hitting sort of the lows that we had earlier this year. And now going back to lows that we haven't seen since about March of 2020. So from a technical as well some of the fundamental standpoint as well. NASDAQ and those tech big companies also being eyed and looked at. Finally Emily let's just take up and take a look at some of these individual stocks. I'm just going to jump that down to the bottom too with Uber and Lyft huge research notes from the street coming out today. Saying that they're looking at making the ramifications the labor department at least on a federal level issuing some guidelines about how to treat gig workers if they're not contractors and their full time employees. How does that impact the revenue and the expenses of course of these companies Uber and Lyft a few of those under pressure today. All right Taylor thanks so much and improvement on day javu indeed okay hundreds of billions of dollars have been wiped off. The chip industry following a worldwide drop in demand for reference Taiwan semiconductor the most valuable chip maker in the world suffering its biggest drop since 1994. For more let's bring back our Bloomberg intelligence senior Alice Wu Jin Ho who's been of course following all the moves and chips and you know Wu Jin we were talking about a potential glut in supply for months but it seems to have taken everyone to buy surprise just this idea that we didn't have enough and now we have too much you know what what is this all happened so fast. Sure so thanks for having me on again Emily so so a couple of things right. I think the recessionary environment the recessionary concerns going into the 2023 have really started to hit the end markets servers PCs TVs so on a support and any electronic goods that seems to be pairing back and we saw evidence of that. Last quarter as with respect to AMD and Intel they.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1932,2022-10-11 21:06:23
13707," and any electronic goods, that seems to be pairing back. And we saw evidence of that last quarter, with respect to AMD and Intel, they made their first round of cuts. And I think what surprised everyone else is that, when we thought it was over, there was another round of cuts by micron as well as AMD. And then layer that on with the geopolitical risk, which is also weighing on TSMC. So would you say downturn in chips is leading or lagging indicator for the rest of the technology industry? Sure. So why don't I take it back into history if we look at pre-COVID? The chip makers were a, an early cycle has always been an early cycle industry. And they were the first one to come down once COVID hit. But once we figured out that COVID was not going to be bad, as bad as initially thought, they were the first ones to come back up from a evaluation perspective, right? It's going to take a while for estimates to catch up. So I know that there were a couple of rounds of cuts on the chips that are already, but even at 14 times, it's still not a trough multiple is going back to 2018. It's still 17% premium to trough multiple. So there still may be another round of earnings because to reflect 2023 expectations. Which companies are in the worst position based on what chips they make and what is most, you know, in the most and over supply? Sure. So if we think about it from an end market perspective, companies that are over indexed on the consumer side are hurt. And one of the reasons why TSMC is hurt so badly is because some of the leading chip manufacturers rely on TSMC's FAFs and think about it Apple, smartphone manufacturers, as well as AMD for their PCs chips. So those three buckets alone is going to create that slide. I think if you think about companies that manufacture their own chips, you have companies like analog devices that do not have as much consumer exposure, but they do have a fair amount of consumer exposure as well that may see a negative impact, as well as companies like Nvidia that's already warned on the weakness on the consumer side. All right, Wojgen Ho, thank you for helping us work through all of this new information. Our Bloomberg Senior Intelligence Analyst appreciate it. Meantime, a new proposal from the Biden administration would classify millions of gig workers as employees, rather than independent contractors. That could have extreme repercussions for companies like Uber and Lyft, which plunged on this news. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Jackie Davilo. So Jackie, tell us exactly what this new law involves and how it would impact the companies that you cover. So the proposal would just still be considered is essentially a new outline for how companies can determine whether their workers are independent contractors or employees, which carry certain legal and wage benefits, things like dental and medical. We all enjoy those as full-time employees. However, independent contractors like couriers and delivery drivers just don't have those same kinds of benefits. So this new proposal is effectively making it easier for companies to look at this certain criteria, some of it, which has been refined from the Trump era rule that it's replacing, like how integral our workers to the business overall, how much control do they have over their earnings, how much control do they have over how they can do their jobs. And these types of questions, which are really, you know, new ones compared to even the Obama era rule that it's mirroring, it's effectively more gig worker friendly. And Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, all have workers that have been clamoring for these types of benefits. So for them, it's certainly a positive. So what happens next? You know, there is a little bit of confusion around just how much of an impact this is actually going to have. And if you look at the statements that Uber and DoorDash and Lyft released, you know, they just weren't surprised. This is something that they were expecting since day one of the Biden administration. But what this really does, it's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1933,2022-10-11 21:10:45
13708," Respecting since day one of the Biden administration, but what this really does, it's more of an interpretive guidance. So it's not going to wipe out the gig worker classification system. What it's doing is saying, look, this is how we're going to look on it, look at it from here on out, and it has more ramifications, say in, you know, litigation if someone sues one of the companies for misclassification. This is the basis that can be used now. For the companies, you know, we look at Uber, who's kind of had to deal with this in London when the Supreme Court over there ruled that they had to classify their London drivers as employees. So they're not totally new to kind of the the impact of what it'll take if they have to switch the model around a bit. But it's certainly going to be somewhat of a hybrid from what legal experts as well as analysts are saying right now. In the meantime, Uber's former security chief in another story dealing with some old legal issues was found guilty of hiding information in a corporate hack attack dating back to 2016, you know, a pretty astounding verdict here. What was your reaction to this? What's been the reaction internally? And within the industry to this in terms of what it means for corporate transparency? You know, Emily, it's funny because that ruling actually that trial was going on going while Uber actually had a recent hack for, I don't, it was the their Slack systems that actually been hacked by by someone. And it was incredible to kind of see the the different reaction the company had. There was a blog post that outlined, you know, day by day what the updates were, what the impact were to customer data. And coming out of that trial, it's really two different Uber's now. The Travis Kalanick years really trickled down into just how the company held our handled corporate transparency now under new leadership. You've really seen that shift, whether it's through hacks or even safety reports, how they view climate progress transparency. The company is really, I think, more focused on just putting everything out on the table, which is a good thing, especially, you know, for customers that, you know, want to rebuild that trust, especially if they were around during the early years. All right. So intriguing. There Bloomberg Shacky Davos will of course follow what's happening with this new law. Appreciate it. Coming up, Mark Zuckerberg wants to make virtual meetings as real as possible. But our workers ready to use Meta's products. We're going to have more on the Meta Connect news. And Mark Zuckerberg's Avatar Legs, of course. Next, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1934,2022-10-11 21:15:08
13709," [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING이란ome playing together with sauce Ath verrga We build horizon work rooms as a first step towards a virtual office in the metaverse. It feels more like being there than any video call. You see more people's body language and the spatial audio gives you a sense of each person's place in the room. You can have side conversations with the people sitting next to you or gesture without physically being there together. It's hard to fully wrap your head around this until you get to experience it. Just some of Mark Zuckerberg's vision there for the workplace of the metaverse. And among other news at the MetaConnect event, Zuckerberg announced part of shares with Microsoft and Zoom to promote virtual collaboration. Unveil the $1500 Quest Pro headset and says meta will add legs soon to avatars. There they are. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Kurt Wagner and the economy founder, David Karpatrick. So Kurt, what are your big takeaways today? Is it the avatar legs? The avatar legs were a pretty easy one to point out and saw, obviously, a little bit better than just floating around in the metaverse. But now I mean, the headset was sort of the flagship product that was announced today. This new kind of high-end VR device. It's as Mark said in that video, it's more tailored toward working professionals. They're kind of going after a higher-end clientele than I think they have with some of their other stuff. But a lot of the technology that they kind of showed off toward the end of the presentation is the stuff in my opinion that's most interesting. This is, for example, like life-like avatars, right? Or even the ability to kind of use your hand or your wrist as a controller. All of that is very cool. The problem is it's just years and years away, right? So now you're asking people to be very patient. You're asking investors to be very patient as they build and work on this stuff. And so I think that's where the issue comes in. It's not that the technology is not cool. It's really far off. David, the stock dropped almost 4%. Why do you think that is? Well, one way to look at it would be, this is a company with 3.5 billion people in a business that's generating like 40 billion a year in after-tack profit that is talking about a business for which they've sold 15 million devices and a metaverse product that has 300,000 users a day. And that's what the management is putting its primary focus on. It would seem if you're an investor in a company that has such misguided priorities, I think you would be very disappointed. Is the workplace David ready for? Metaverse technology. No, not at all. No, it is not. It is not. It's simply not. We don't want to meet in the metaverse. It's very nice that Zoom and Microsoft have talked about possibly making a 3D version of their meeting products, but that is not what most people want to do. The company's behaving as if it was a gaming company. I mean, everything today was talked about as if it was a company for gaming, the kind of technologies or gaming technologies. It's kind of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1935,2022-10-11 21:19:43
13710," So behaving as if it was a gaming company. I mean, everything today was talked about as if it was a company for gaming, the kind of technologies or gaming technologies. It's kind of a gaming psychology, gaming aesthetics. But that isn't really what this company is. And it's a scary, scary situation this company has put itself in in my opinion. Kurt, what's your response to that? I think David's right. I mean, as I kind of alluded to there, right? To tech school, but can they convince investors that it's worth waiting 10 years for, right? And David points out like they have a business here that needs attention right now, which is the advertising business, right? I mean, they're kind of dealing with a real serious threat right here and now with TikTok and young people not necessarily want to use their apps. And so when you think about that that's the current state of the business and then you look at what the priorities need to be for Mark Zuckerberg, it doesn't necessarily align. And I imagine that there are a lot of people clearly, I guess, given the stock movement today, that saw this and thought, man, why are they spending so much time and money on this problem when they have others that they need to be addressing? Now, we spoke to Francis Hagen last week, of course, the Facebook whistleblower. And she had an interesting thought about Cheryl Sandberg leaving the company and the company now, of course, being fully in the hands of Mark Zuckerberg. Take a listen to what she had to say. Mark has surrounded himself with people who tell him the same kinds of stories over and over again. Facebook is just a mirror. It doesn't have responsibility. All these things that we're complaining about have always been present. We're just showing them to people. We don't play any role in this. We have no power. David, curious what your thoughts are on that? Well, I completely agree with her analysis of how they see this. I mean, to the degree Zuckerberg thinks about the sort of sociocultural impact of the products that he's built, he's still basically in the mindset of making the world more open and connected is really cool. And he thinks the metaverse is the next stage of that. He doesn't want to take responsibility for the ongoing problems that he has not resolved. And I continue to think that the reason the company changed its name almost exactly a year ago at the height of Francis Hogan's revelations about numerous misdeeds and errors and unresolved problems was to change the narrative, which to their credit was very successful as a PR move, but isn't really successful as a business move long-term. And now they're stuck with a new name and an ostensible direction that isn't really rational. So they have such serious problems. And if any other company had these problems, the CEO would be out. But this is a company with no governance with a board that is just a paper board because Zuckerberg completely controls it. He can't be fired. He controls all the shares. He controls a majority of the shares so he can do whatever he wants. And that is a very dangerous situation. And it is dangerous for investors to be in this company, even though its PE is lower than any other major tech company by a substantial margin. It's not a good investment going forward. Well, and that's in part because its market cap has dropped so much since Francis Hogan and since the company changed its name, this is now a $345 million company, David Howbad, with things have to get before Mark Zuckerberg considers something as extreme as taking it private. Well, you know that's something that I have thought about as a possible remedy for the problems the company has because then it could address the serious challenges it faces without the stock market breathing down its neck and judging it with the voting machine of the stock every single day, they have a lot of expensive problems to fix and it would be a lot better to do it if they were private. But I think it would have to get a lot worse. I mean, look, the stock is down from almost a trillion to $350 billion now. It could go down to $250 billion at which point. I don't think it would be irrational for him to consider taking it private since he completely controls it. Kurt, you know, we've talked and seen so much of their vision for virtual reality. What about augmented?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1936,2022-10-11 21:23:56
13711," taken a private since he completely controls it. Kurt, you know, we've talked and seen so much of their vision for virtual reality. What about augmented reality? How much farther does this go? Yeah, well, we saw some glimpses of that in the headset, right? They're calling it mixed reality, but it's this idea that while you're wearing the headset, you can actually see the world around you, you can overlay graphics or, you know, digital objects on that world. And that's ultimately the vision that Zuckerberg has for AR glasses, right, that we might wear them to look sort of like reading spectacles, but you'll wear those and that's how you'll interact without more, you know, not really a bulky headset. But, you know, I think to David's point here, what's interesting is like Mark Zuckerberg would probably tell you, hey, listen, you're betting on me, right? I have made for the most part pretty good business decisions for almost 20 years, and that's why he has control and that's why people, you know, invest in this company, but over the last year or so, I think he's really raised some questions as to whether this is a pet project of his or whether this is actually a good, you know, use of, you know, funds and attention, and we won't know that for like 10 years, and so that's, I think, the big trouble here is it's hard to say whether or not he's right. 10 years, very long time, especially if you're an investor, thinking about the near term, Bloomberg's Kurt Wagner and Teconi founder David Karpatrick, thank you both. We're gonna be right back with more of Bloomberg Technology. This is Bloomberg. Hello everybody, somebody on their Inst runtime. More allegations in the Elon Musk Twitter battle, Bloomberg has learned that just before the billionaire revives his proposal to buy the social media company, he accused Twitter of ordering a whistleblower to destroy evidence. According to court filings, Peter Zachko said he burned 10 handwritten notebooks and deleted 100 computer files at the request of managers as part of a $7.8 million dollar severance package.

The SEC has brought dozens of cases against digital asset managers, including the $15 million fine to block fire back in February. Coming up, start-ups getting strapped for cash and not why not change anytime soon.

It's the first time the company is hosting two big sales the same year. Was it the right call? And also, why some of those discounts may be deceiving. This is Bloomberg. Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. Your VC spent years aggressively buying stakes and cash burning tech startups, the current environment, and cratering share prices of even mature tech companies have dimmed the prospects for startups that were working towards their own IPOs. What does that mean? What does the future hold?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1938,2022-10-11 21:32:20
13713," share prices of even mature tech companies have dimmed the prospects for startups that were working towards their own IPOs. What does that mean? What does the future hold for them? Let's talk about all that. And more with Henry Ward CEO of the equity management solutions provider, Karta. So Karta has some fascinating insights into these pre-IPO companies. Henry, what's happening inside these companies right now? And what's the mood like? Yeah, sure. It's a tale of two stories. Here, there's a growth stage story where a lot of these growth companies are sort of in a frozen capital markets ring where they can't raise capital right now because they can't justify the prices that they raised previous rounds at. They're not willing to do down rounds because these rounds trigger anti-dolution provisions for early investors and it penalize its management. And so they're kind of stuck in limbo with these high prices that they priced six months a year ago, but the public markets won't support and they're trying to figure out what to do. In the early stage markets, there are a lot more active. Prices are resetting quickly. We're seeing investors continue to be active. There's a lot of dry powder. And so it's a very interesting market. We see this in our business a lot where early stage ventures still active. There's still a lot of deals happening with growth stage ventures that are still. What is happening with hiring and layoffs? We had a guest on an investor a few months ago who said he was expecting to see two to three million job cuts across the tech industry. Is that even close to happening? Not even close. It's really interesting in H1 of 2020 when we saw the massive set of layoffs happening. We saw headcount growth among our customer base grow about 7% this year. In the first half of this year, we've seen about 12% growth rates. So it's not as high as the boom boom years of 2018 and 19 where we were growing at 15 to 20% depending on the year. But 12% somewhere in the middle. It's not as bad as 2020. It's not as great as 18 and 19. But we're still seeing a lot of startups grow really being led by B2B SaaS businesses. So if you look at other sectors like healthcare biotech, they're suffering a little bit more. But B2B SaaS continues to to trends wrongly. So how do you square that with? We've heard from so many big tech companies there. You know, freezing hiring, slowing hiring down. They're being more deliberate. Do the numbers translate? Yeah. So if you look what's happening in the public markets that's translating to the private markets is there's, you know, in earlier this year, there was sort of a massive capitulation of investors saying, hey, these all these companies are overpriced. We don't know which companies are going to survive, which companies are going to succeed, which companies aren't. And so they punish the entire tech sector. What's happening now is the emergence of investors deciding, well, they're all companies aren't created equal. Some are more will grow better and survive through this period and others won't. And we have to sift through these companies and decide which ones are going to be the winners and which ones aren't. And what you're seeing is the bigger companies and even the smaller companies that are transactional revenue based, where the revenue can be volatile are punished more by investors than recurring revenue, contractual revenue businesses. So when you look at like the great software business like Salesforce and Snowflake, where they have contractual recurring revenue and high net dollar retention and high growth rates, they're doing quite well. They're starting to recover, but you see other transactional businesses are business based on media or other types of revenue models. They're being punished more severely. And so your starting to see a sector or a rotation between the high quality of companies and the lower quality of companies. And that's that's trickling into the to the venture world where you're starting to see investors just be more selective in the business models that they're willing to support rather than just support anything that seems like a great idea. Meantime, Karta is expanding internationally. I understand you've bought three companies since June. How are you expanding so quickly in the middle of a downturn or is it that you're seeing some potentially opportunistic valuations out there and taking advantage or taking those opportunities as you see them? Yeah, so last year we decided as a board and a company that we were going to get more aggressive internationally. We've always believed that sort of our the problem we're solving is ownership in companies and ownership is a global phenomenon, a global problem that we can solve across the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1939,2022-10-11 21:36:57
13714," We've always believed that sort of our, the problem we're solving is ownership in companies and ownerships of global phenomenon, a global problem that we can solve across the world. Obviously, every region has its own nuances and regulatory requirements and we're not experts outside the United States. And so what we've seen over the last few years, which has been really exciting for me personally as a founder, is all these carda startups in different regions. So we found the carda of UK. We found the carda of China. We found the carda of South Korea. We've found the carda of India. We've been and found the card of Africa. We've found carda in all regions. And I would say almost every developed country now, we have some version of a carda. Some founders started a carda for that country. And we've been talking all these founders and some of these founders we've invested in their rounds to help support them in their region and then others, including the three that you mentioned like Capdesk and Europe, Vellbown and London and then Zen Equity and India. We've actually bought the companies after getting to know the founders and falling in love with the team and the product. And really their goal is to build out what we've built in the United States and build it out for their region and their local market structure and then start connecting these things so that we have a global platform for equity management. It's an amazing time right now to do M&A. As prices are resetting, capital becomes more scarce. Founders are more willing to look at opportunities to join larger companies. We have a super active corporate dev team. Obviously, as you mentioned, we've done three deals just in the last two quarters, which we're really excited about. Nothing to announce yet, but we've got more in the pipe as we look across the world and try to find the cardest for every country and country. All right, pivoting to crypto for a moment. You recently introduced a crypto fund administration whereby anyone can run their own crypto fund on Karta, explain that and what the end goal is. Sure, so we have about 60% of our revenue comes out of the core cap table business, what we're best known for. 30% of our revenue comes from fund administration where we manage the accounting and the investment schedules for venture funds. Obviously, one of the big things themes that's happened in the last few years is the rise of crypto, particularly crypto investing. So we've done two things on the crypto side. So one is we've built software that allows venture funds that are raising crypto funds, which are different than traditional venture funds because they can now invest in tokens. They can take both equity and staffs and other token-like investments right alongside their equity investments. So it's a slightly different way to manage a venture fund. We built software to help support those venture funds. And then on the startup side, there's all these startups that are raising effectively capital via tokens and what we call a token cap table. So who owns all the tokens of initial startup? And so we also have a token cap table offering which allows startups to manage both their equity cap table and their token cap table and card up. All right, Henry Ward, CEO of Carda, good to have you back with us, Henry, thank you for stopping by. Coming up, could NFTs mean the end of the password for good, unstoppable domains is next.

13715," if you if if if 5 6 6 6 3 4 5 Time now for our crypto reporter. We're taking a look at diversity in Web 3 with the leading Web 3 identity platform, unstoppable domains, which just announced a new goal to provide online courses on crypto and Web 3 and distribute millions in NFTs, domains to 5 million Latinas to help them build and control their digital identity senior vice president and channel chief Sandy Carter joins us now for more on this. We're going to talk about that. But first I want to talk about the whole password and username issue, which we've been using ever since the internet's been around. How is unstoppable domains trying to change that? Yeah, thanks for having me, Emily. Unstoppable domains presents a digital identity to every user and that digital identity can be used to log into over 400 different applications, also be used to supplement email, do into an encrypted email as well as build a website. So it completely changes the model on its head, uses one way to get into an application and then that digital identity travels with you and that data stays with you, which is such a powerful proposition. I believe that digital identity and that ownership is not just something that's nice to have, but is a human right. So how realistic is this and how far off is it a world where we don't have to use your names and passwords at all? So I think we're just beginning our journey. I like to say Emily that we're in the dial-up phase of Web 3. There are so many capabilities you can already do with your digital identity and log into a set of applications, but the field is really limitless. I believe in the future will be storing healthcare data, education records, tickets, driver's license in there. So I think it's the right time to get started playing around and experimenting with your digital identity and to own it now. Since you own it, you don't rent it. It's very powerful to have that today as we're getting started versus waiting until it's too late. I know you've also been incredibly active getting more women into Web 3. You now have this announcement focused on Latinas. Talk to us about what this means and how you're hoping to increase diversity in this world for an increasingly important population. Yeah, well, you know, we just chatted about how we're early. And because we are so early in this initiative, I think it's really important that we hear all voices, you know, based on data from McKenzie and from Deloitte.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1941,2022-10-11 21:45:59
13716," Oh, early in this initiative, I think it's really important that we hear all voices. You know, based on data from McKenzie and from Deloitte, we know that diversity breeds more innovation. And right now, the population inside of Web3 and the metaverse is only 8% women. So we're not gonna get that powerhouse innovation we need if we stay so homogeneous. So back in March, March and this year. Yeah. Go ahead. Back in March 8th of this year, I announced an initiative called Unstoppable Women of Web3, whose goal is to educate that next generation of women and to help more women come into the space. And because Emily, I had so many women asked me for that education in their own native language. That's why we're announcing today that we're bringing that education to our Latina population and providing that education in Spanish. Now, you know, we've heard a lot of people in the Linde Gates, for example, has expressed concerns about women backsliding as a result of the pandemic and now a macroeconomic downturn. We've heard concerns about this within the broader tech industry as well. Do you have concerns about women in crypto, women in Web3, backsliding, or losing some of the progress they've made? You know, given, you know, these dreadful economic conditions that we're facing. It's interesting. So I met Fortune's most powerful women conference today. I actually got to meet Melinda Gates and chat with her some about this. I think that the, um, the output that's coming out right now in terms of the amount of interest in Web3, you know, conferences, even this one here, so many questions about what is the metaverse? How can we play? How do we get started? The conference is around the world are just bringing in so much interest. So I think for Web3 and the metaverse, I believe that if we can provide the right set of education, that we can really accelerate the number of women in the space. In fact, the number of developers alone in the Web3 space is increased by 66% most recently. So with the interest, I think now is that perfect storm. You know, that early days where we can get more women interested, understanding what it is so that they can jump in and have a really big impact. And I think now is the time given we are so early. All right, Sandy Carter of Unstoppable Domain, Sandy, thank you for joining us. Coming up is Amazon Prime Day still worth it? What does it tell us to expect about the holiday shopping season? That's next. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg. Bloomberg. Bloomberg. Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1942,2022-10-11 21:49:30
13717," Music...... Today, Amazon's second prime sale of the year, but the question on everyone's mind is, is it still a bargain? New research suggests maybe not. One of the professors behind that research is joining me now for more on this Jin Hong-Shi-A, a marketing professor at the University of Florida's board of college business along with our very own Brad Storm, who has of course covered Amazon for for decades. So, Jin Hong, tell us a little bit more about your research. The main thesis seems to be that these aren't the discounts aren't as big as you might think. Yes, this is a research, I conduct with my co-author, Yes, this is a research I conduct with my co-author, Sonsik Park at the University of South Carolina, and the Manchia at the Arzona State University. We invested the product sold on Amazon, and we find this a new pattern of pricing, in which the seller simultaneously increased price. And this place, this price, and make announcements of a price discount. So, in this way, a price increase is framed as a price discount. And the seller buyers sold the discount, and they saw that they get a bargain, but actually they paid more than the consumer who bought it. So, before the seller displayed the discount. Okay, so you're potentially actually paying more for something that you think you're getting at a discount. Brad, is this, you know, a long time Amazon strategy? Or is this something new? I'm... Yeah, I might call it... Take it away. Probably a long time retail strategy. I don't know that it's necessarily unique to Amazon. I can see it in department stores, and even discount stores. The idea of discounting something, and making the discount kind of an illusion, and inflating the actual retail prices, is I think a tactic across retail, and I think it's probably harder to control an Amazon, given that more than half of those sales are going to be brokered by third-party sellers, who control their own prices. It's probably something that's hard for Amazon to oversee. Okay, to implement this... Go ahead. Go ahead. My question in the business... The question in the business... You know, it seems like we saw some lackluster interest this second half of the year, and I'm wondering why that is. Is it because the discounts aren't really discounts? Is it because they already did this once this year? Is it because we're, you know, going into a recession potentially, and people just don't have as much money to spend, Jen-hung? I think what I'm talking about is not that you didn't get a discount. Is you actually were charged at a higher price when you were told you get a discount. So usually, the seller display at least price, or make least price comparison, when they actually drop price, because the price promotion, they may not give you the discounted claim, but in this case, the seller actually increased price, and the tell you it's discounted, and then they, or two days later, they will remove this discounted claim and the drop of price. So this is a very different. So. Okay. Brad, you know, Brad talked to us about the actual interest we saw this time around, and you know, this whole idea that split it into-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1943,2022-10-11 21:54:43
13718," about the actual interest we saw this time around. And you know, this whole idea that is split it into prime days, you know, the thought was that would drive more interest, but I wonder if maybe it didn't, it's not necessarily working. I would say Emily, it's probably a little too soon to say that today was a failure. I mean, remember, this is not a prime day. This is a prime early act of sale and it's this new creature. It's hard to compare it to the summer sale. It's really weird timing, right? That no one is holly shopping yet or at least you're not if you're a normal procrastinator like me. Other big sales days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday are around the corner. The numbers we have really don't tell a consistent story. I think we can both tell that like Twitter mentions and chatter about this sale are down. There's one research firm that's saying that basically sales today, Clover's the research firm, were similar to the previous 30 day average. But then you have another firm numerator saying that the average order size is way up and that the big sales, the big sale items are Amazon gift cards and Echo dots, the small Alexa devices. So look, if the purpose of this for Amazon is the deep in its relationship with prime customers and get more prime customers before the holidays to kind of lock shoppers in, then maybe they can declare this as success as they move into the holidays. Jin-Hong, is there something that you think needs to happen here based on what you've found? There has been a lot of scrutiny of the way Amazon prices certain goods, but not necessarily of the practice that you're talking about in particular. Do we need some regulation? We think the attention is required for this new practice because the regulation has been focused on the very good regulation, the set pricing has been put on the legitimate value of a list price. Whether you use the inflated or fake list price, but this is a different practice. This is the manipulation of the timing of this price introduction. So the seller synchronized the price increase with this price introduction and the comparison. So that's a new practice and this is really a new leading book consumer. Hmm? Brad, what's your take on the signals we're seeing about shopping and consumer sentiment right now heading into the holidays? It's tough, Emily. You've got the rising cost of food and fuel inflation. Folks are pulling back. There's no question that overall you are spending over the holidays is slowing down Adobe. I think that it was going to be about 2.5%. Previous years, you know, 8%, 9%. Of course, it was even higher because of pandemic fuel fear out of walking into stores. And retail has been kind of an anvil frame as on. You've got a very successful advertise business, AWS, of course. Even some sort of successful business around third party sellers and commissions, but retail itself, those online stores are they were flat last holiday season. It was down 4% in the last quarter. I think, you know, Amazon here, which has got hold up share for years, decades, is probably not going to be doing that this holiday season. All right, Bloomberg, Brad Stone, along with Jin Hong Shea, professor at the University of Florida, fascinating research from you. Of course, we're going to keep watching to see how this primed day unfolds. And that doesn't for this edition of Bloomberg Technology. Wednesday, we're going to have Amazon's head of prime on to talk about prime date 2.0 and holiday shopping sentiment.

13719, Upbeat Music...................... The great sci-fi art of the mid-twentieth century tees the vision of the future with one distinct element and common a life for humans in outer space whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business space travel seemed like it was just around the corner... Yet here we are a half century later and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism that long awaited future could be here sooner than we think.. For most of the history of spaceflight governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge along with innovative.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1945,2022-10-11 22:02:45
13720," from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with a Russian federal space agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism. Private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward, pick a short reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy-lifters. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight. So you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first seat to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide it with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the Vom Carmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there, and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. If you don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital, so when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship, you've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up, and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that, and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St. G. Children's Research Hospital, and I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1946,2022-10-11 22:07:24
13721," Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia at lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave and they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Hey Lee, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, what you're talking about race and ethnicity and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by super power, like the United States or Russia or China, well that's like really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. There are two billion dollar project called AxStation, who will become the first free-flying private international space station. Or to use a more consumer friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. So it's easy to carry instead of this giant tin can with all of that. The inflatable is lighter. You can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, half the less than half the weight probably. But even as space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours. So I haven't been privy to their private contracts. But I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make you make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of that I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you if something goes wrong. It's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider. A force space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities. It doesn't talk about private entities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1947,2022-10-11 22:11:42
13722," Another space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities, it doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom, you see the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that. Because the way it would be outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. So we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person, maybe there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do with microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist at space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Even if space hotels are right around the corner, don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely unaffordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-article space. When it becomes more like buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and, you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating costs of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies. Virgin Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launch delays and major funders, including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard and it's an absolutely shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago. And it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1948,2022-10-11 22:16:02
13723," jurors and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards of very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in a, it's in our DNA, it's that exploration bug, we are in exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. Vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be make a pilgrimage to Yosemite, all very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost house of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide and mine is a man named Jan and his crew. Aaron, let's take a look at the 10 Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer, but only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Svorestra, I'm an industrial designer out of LA and I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account and I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1949,2022-10-11 22:19:56
13724," I'm not going to be a North because this, yep, my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Wait a minute, we had a cab, but we got here lay last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM Land right on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. Oh man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. It has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet. Yeah. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA. Yep. And then just roll out when you want it. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. Yeah. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. This awning. This is phenomenal. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. I just popped that out. Sort of. So, home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down. So, a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation room somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up, it's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So, we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So, I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're poopin' out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos.

After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. My man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through Yosemite. Without a reservation, we had to talk our way in. Oh yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. Glad we got out of the smoke. Whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. It's 4 and 4 hours or so and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of Yosemite for the smoky... Look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where is it we're here in this near Fresno, this is California Farm Country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg so we're right in the Central Valley of California. Very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the red basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of Gus. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got so it was essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor, just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and finally got to the point where he said you know what, I either got to get out of this business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1951,2022-10-11 22:29:19
13726," And it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed. And this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so, just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this labor point, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor, I think, like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is kind of like the test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building and so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure, and spray and water out it in also just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the central valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where are they going? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the central valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019. Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay, and how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean, we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean, these machines, they just drive. But basically what we're doing, besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard gas, mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future, we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. So vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating.

Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon and hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months, she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew, tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor nut? No. Apparently, he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93-year-olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trustee companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle Worksforne is really start up called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ella Kew. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ella Kew. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that cannot and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis, we see that somebody tells her that they love her. Really? Or that they like her? Or that they miss her? Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1953,2022-10-11 22:37:31
13728," They like her. Like, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. Mm-hmm. They'll also tell her I'm depressed, or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human, because they don't feel like they'll be judged. L.E.Q. is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. L.E.Q. Tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise, you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now, they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of L.E.Q. From the way L.E.Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job, and it could be really hard, and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like the they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. L.E.Q. Tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up, and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. L.E.Q. Yes. Scheduled doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Well, older people connect to a robot, and she said, I don't know, let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia, and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1954,2022-10-11 22:41:55
13729," Lee for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job at Ugradschool was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming up all kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshots you worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where we'll be like a circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and have beer in their hand. And I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? It's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss Ellie Cuban? She always tells me to take a drink of water. At least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now the Q, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. Ella Cue, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that Ella Cue is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship or human care. Blastんな, CU Sova.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1955,2022-10-11 22:46:30
13730," Humans and human companionship are human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans. Not take humans jobs, leave humans without purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you are like the estimated 74 percent of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be one of the most impressive examples of the Internet of justice. If you are like the estimated 74 percent of adults in the US who use YouTube, You made it 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube. This might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. It's often it involves toys and for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think it was the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in a toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless, but how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it political technology, a big nighttime online show shared by brushing your user's notification. The company and their own works who launched their own Pixel Pixel struggles have hundreds of of your daily res Wrestling Daily and well different experiences were started. Interailleurs are more curious in the story of what big, very high quality church example. The commission specifically to learn more from both of your self was not ready.

13731," and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes, greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go, fighting man, but I do go on the land of the TNT air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toy started to become designed for a 30-second commercial. Close it's a mild amount of toolbox. Open it's a micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles, planes and post to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the real working job, highway, passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30-second commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds, and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. It's a mild amount of equipment. See a bad man. That man's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industries continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business, just growing a couple of percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, and drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005, and this was like, you know, the very early Web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what was the time was the user-generated content, like web blogging with the big Myspace, which is the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks to just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, Lazy Sunday, if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Killsonania! Oh, Charlie! I'm going to be a bit big. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1957,2022-10-11 22:55:14
13732," A chief audience officer at Maker Studios, I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is, one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform, and you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products, and then around 2012 and 2013, we saw this explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannel, and a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy, and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners, and it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this whole new format, and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss, and you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star, and they would open toys, and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed just about every toy, and people were just really excited. You open the toy, and you see a toy pop out, and kids just got excited, and see it piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom, we're in a, he's eating a lobster. The early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, it was terrible, I mean, they were 10 minutes long, they were boring, it was a shaky camera, there was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience, and they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video, it has 200,000 views on it, and it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing, and just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that, I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL surprise you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you'd collect. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting, it was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, 2016 they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1958,2022-10-11 22:59:26
13733," They said like what? And they said for example there is, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night and I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you buy with anybody buy an iPhone, take it home and open the box and show it on the camera and everybody will go and watch it. So I typed toy on boxing and my god I saw so many different videos and people kids and adults might toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why why not come up with the ultimate and that's it. That's the first L.O.R. surprise. Alright oh yes we've got a goal goal. L.O.L. changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play which became part of the entertainment. So normally if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out that's not exciting. You open up L.O.L. you peel it away you open up inside you have seven surprises and it took off like wildfire and quickly became you know the top toy in the country. By December of 2018 eight of the top 10 toys sold were all L.O.L. surprise brand and according to MGA from 2016 to 2020 L.O.L. would generate over ten billion dollars in retail sales worldwide. You know L.O.L. was bigger than Star Wars it's bigger than Marvel it's bigger than Barbie these brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone you don't have to you know figure out what Marvel are Star Wars is and L.O.L. it clips them all. In the toy world blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of L.O.L. in 2014 the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins and in 2016 spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets L.O.L. surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube and not putting ads on YouTube but working with creators and influencers to get their products in the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost not a necessity. In late 2015 Nickelodeon parent company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said well if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had except the conflict we are going to stop at your advertisement of toys. At the time Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network and not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death nap but MGA necessity is the mother of invention that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to they had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom both in L.A. federal court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon parent company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So that by itself forces us to go and say okay they help with Nickelodeon and let's find another way to reach to children and that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube especially and the rest as they say.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1959,2022-10-11 23:03:45
13734," All right. Here's what I'd like to show you. Dr Akmar. Thanks for that. Better show. Well. Okay. Sounds good. All right. равно que sentido. I mean. Dah, you're still a guy. Me? I think I'm going to come up. I'm not going to marry him. Done? I'm going to come up now. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl Singh. Good morning, Chocklady Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL surprise and you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million and even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ads spend and then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated you have to really take a deep dive into each platform and I'm promoting on Twitter, my promoting on Instagram, my promoting on TikTok. What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017 big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's world would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started you know charging for their services as they started building a following. Now because it is such a big business the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. And Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product. We made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1960,2022-10-11 23:08:08
13735," We get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, and meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically a TV show around the toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. I mean, had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform, YouTube Kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that, responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New John Risen formats there, that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like, their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands. And that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year, and there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1961,2022-10-11 23:12:52
13736," situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team, and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley. And like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big, so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things, and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote. Because it became so popular, so fast, that cities could no longer control it. And a peak night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests, and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their bigger cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Addyrbmb, and you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of measures, still. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York, because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets. And also, it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations, that could intern Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1962,2022-10-11 23:16:53
13737," If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to put in their perspectives, their risk factors, when they have to say, well, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into her room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner bodega, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Is back? Have you passed out there? Here you are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1963,2022-10-11 23:21:29
13738," Ebb and B is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Ebb and B's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what Ebb and B's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Ebb and B's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Ebb and B, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Ebb and B's entire business model is under threat. Forms Earth View sounds far fetched at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the map to distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing the basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds unique creativity and ambition. Today the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupula. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1964,2022-10-11 23:25:09
13739," Look at the earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object with ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture and explore beyond earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live. And it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter. And in total, they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's Space Operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in Lower Thorbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part I think is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using it in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1965,2022-10-11 23:29:44
13740," these sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that, and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away. An additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150th, the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. And that's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside. Which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the personalized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. But now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have the day to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window, whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronaut on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we can-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1966,2022-10-11 23:34:15
13741," Astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others, including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market, and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on the surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure, they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA, they think the best way to build a habitat on Marsha the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be so absorbed in the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material, it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg and if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form, it's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space and finding solutions for how to build the order.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1967,2022-10-11 23:38:29
13742," Very harsh, the cold, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, and finding solutions for how to build their door, or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant, lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site, and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth, and then we go prove it out on the moon, and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX, who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI Space Factory hope their technology could be monetized, as well as transformational, here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars force those to kind of make this jump in construction technology, which we can now apply on Earth, to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured, very energy intensive materials, to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station. On the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground, while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space and industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1968,2022-10-11 23:42:54
13743," This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later, and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighborhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So, you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living the city and then move out to the suburbs when you have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down. See the West Palm Beach, Miami area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic, we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Goshen, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being corded by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic, combined with record low interest rates, has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. Houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became what really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping.

13744," 820s to mid 40s and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram and within an hour you have 15-20 replies saying can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quid-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say you can have that, you can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. Ten years ago the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. There's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I want to live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. In the pandemic, many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Let's stay ownership.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1970,2022-10-11 23:51:33
13745," Get important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Relic state ownership. Let's start small. Let's don't be scared to start small. Instead, instead of renting a big house in the hills and California, like most artists do, buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte Main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming out, really home buying with a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer upper sight on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. I don't have any questions. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products and look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey. This can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit. But it also speaks to again, this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at $450, we could put $300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram and they say, I love it. Can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So while we can definitely, as brokers, create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1971,2022-10-11 23:55:53
