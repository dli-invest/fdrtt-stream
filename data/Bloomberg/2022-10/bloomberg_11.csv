13091," It has its more than---- And its more than--"" It's more than---- Thetilis It's impossible. The industry is in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life family isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are a trillion dollars of doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. When US jobs numbers are released, bang on. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. If you're looking for 263,000, you've won an instant expert analysis. Participation coming down to you. Put it all together for us. This is a slight disappointment relative to hope. You can find anything if your hawkers are published in this work. It's going to keep the fed on track for 75 basis point rules at the next meeting. This labor market is still pretty resilient. Nobody covers job state like Bloomberg, your global business authority.VEZ LINEFALL입니다. You're watching Debrake Asia. Good evening from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York. I'm Kathleen Hayes. I'm Annabel Drollers in Hong Kong. And I'm Heidi Stradwatt's in Sydney. The top story is our Asian stocks under pressure with strong years, jobs, data of supporting expectations of further aggressive fat Hikes Chinese markets are returning after the Golden Week holiday. China's top leaders hold their final gathering before the crucial Communist Party Congress has set to hands in, paying a third term as president and Beijing blasts the Biden administration's new chip restrictions saying they'll hurt supply chains and the world economy. Well, Heidi, Kathleen, we do have Japan and Korea shots. So far, Australia is the major market here trading this morning and taking a pulse check using the IMAT function. We can see that the selling here is very broad basis morning. Most sectors here in the red and we're watching a particular of those moves that we're seeing the biggest losses for the ones that are sensitive to rate.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1317,2022-10-10 00:02:35
13092," See that the selling here is very broad base this morning. Most sectors here in the red and what we're watching in particular, those moves that we're seeing, the biggest losses for the ones that are sensitive to rate rises here like IT, real estate, consumer discretionary among them, the biggest laggards here this morning. US futures also lower should indicate that because of that big sell, if we had it in the Wall Street session on Friday. This is all a real reaction to the job state that we came through. So basically the later market is still looking tight there. And also what we're seeing in terms of the supply of workers, not enough to cool wage growth there. So basically sealing the deal for a 75 basis point, strike from the Fed at its next meeting, also possibly another of the same magnitude in December. So certainly a lot of recessionary risks that's feeding through in the session this morning. Also weighing on sectors that are traditionally a little bit more sensitive or hold up better when we do have a raising rates environment. So ones like utilities, healthcare, financials, all in the red this morning. Also playing out on what we're seeing in the bond space. If you change on now, taking a look what we're seeing in terms of yields in the longer duration, the Aussie 10 year, also the Kiwi 10 year, both of those are moving higher this morning. No cash trading should mention that because we do have a Japan shop. This is Treasuries I'm talking about. Japan shut also Columbus Day latest. We won't get any moves on that. You can just check what we're seeing in future. So at the bottom of your screen, but a lot of concerns here about the impact of tighter policy and what that could mean for the risk of a prolonged contraction. Seeing more moves back into the dollar off that. So you can see that playing out in the weakness we see for the yen. And also the offshore yuan. We will of course be watching for the open of mainland markets in China. Heidi later today following the Golden Week holiday. Not a great picture. We're getting so far in terms of travel or consumption patterns. And of course, it continues to be about what? To the world's central banks are doing pushing those interest rates into restrictive territory causing fears now. Of overdoing it in financial markets. Let's bring out Chief Rates of Correspondent for Asia and our in-life contributor, Garfield Reynolds. And Garfield last week we talked about house swap markets might actually be pricing in a policy misstep right that might cause a policy reversal. If you take a look at the labor market data out of the US on Friday, does that really just deliver another gut punch to those hoping for an earlier pivot? Yeah, pretty pretty much. I was talking last week about Charlie Brown and the football. And yeah, certainly the footballs back in Lucy's hands, so to speak, for those who are up with that cartoon. But there's very little in those jobs numbers that would encourage any of the Fed presidents out there and governors to be thinking that a pivot would be appropriate. So markets still have some pretty strong expectations that inflation has peaked and therefore at some stage Fed hawkish to speak. But until the labor market shows serious signs that it is weakening, there's not a lot of motivation for the Fed to shift to an easier setup when it comes to policy unless you get a sustained drop in inflation. And that's the key thing too. J. Powell and others have been clear. They want to see sustained data showing that inflation is cooling down and something where inflation goes from 8.3 or so down to even under 8%. So it's got a seven handle. Is that going to be enough? Probably not. I think it's going to go lower than that. I bet you do too, Garfield Reynolds. Thanks so much. Well, let's move on to what's going on in China now as Chinese President Xi Jinping has opened the Communist Party's final meeting before the National Congress begins next Sunday. But COVID cases nationwide are mounting and we're seeing new evidence of slowing economic activity. Our chief North Asia correspondent, Steven Engel, joins us to look at this backdrop and give us some sense of how all these things may or may not affect what's going to be happening this week and next. Yeah, I mean, the plenum is happening right now. It was kicked off yesterday by Xi Jinping. It's happening essentially what they're doing behind closed doors is getting all their ducks in a row and fine-tuning. Obviously, Xi Jinping's big speech at the Party Congress on Sunday coming up, but also kind of get some policy crossing the Ts. dotting the eyes and the like. Excuse the mixed metaphors there, obviously. But again, it's just be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1318,2022-10-10 00:06:57
13093," on Sunday coming up, but also kind of get some policy crossing the T's, dotting the eyes and the like. Excuse the mixed metaphors there, obviously, but again, it's just behind closed doors of getting the policy right that they're going to essentially outline. And that's the big question. What will Xi Jinping likely say on Sunday? Well, he will most likely trump it the successes of COVID-0, even though it has taken its severe toll on the economy, obviously. What he says on Taiwan will be significant. What he says on the property slowdown will be significant. So this week is going to be a lot of prognostications and expectations for what he might say. And that's being done behind closed doors today by today and tomorrow and the rest of this week by the Central Committee. Some 370 members of the Central Committee along with the alternates before the 3000 delegates are so attend the National Congress that comes up on Sunday. Starts on Sunday. COVID-0 looms large though. How do we expect that to be addressed? Well, he will be trumpeting the successes of that, even though patients and tolerance in society starting to wear thin, even who Xi Jinping is the fairly strident former editor-in-chief of the global times, says static management. That's the euphemism now for COVID-0, essentially becoming intolerable in society. And we've seen that being reflected in the economic data of late. The Ticing Services PMI is the latest set of numbers that we got on Saturday showing that the lockdowns that we saw in Chengdu in Lasa, in Daliang, and in other major cities in September really took its toll, especially at a time when we usually get a bunchload of spending by consumers during the weeklong national week holidays that just completed obviously. And spending is down considerably again for another big holiday period in China. And the services PMI went into contraction down to 49.5 or 49.3. We were expecting 54.5 so it was well off those numbers. So again, this is part of the tricky balancing act that Xi Jinping will have to convey that the efforts that the Communist Party is putting in across China on COVID-0 outweighs the short-term negative impact on the economy. The problem is how long is short-term? It could potentially, if COVID-0 policies continue or static management continues as some say until the National People's Congress, the annual session of parliament in March, that could be a further, further drag on growth. They had 1,600 cases nationwide. That is the most since September 2nd. Still, a lot of people outside of China are saying 1,600 in a nation of 1.4 billion people. That's not a lot. You're going to be seeing likely Xi Jinping doubling down on that policy when he addresses the party Congress on Sunday. Our Chief North Asia correspondent, Steven Engel, there with the latest, let's get you to Bonnie Quinn, who has our first red headlines, Bonnie. Heidi, thank you. China is criticizing the expanded U.S. restrictions on its access to semiconductor technology. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mauning called them on fair and said they will also hurt the interests of U.S. companies. She believed they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. Recent U.S. measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In his first comment on the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service, alleging they had helped from some Russians, as well as unarmed foreign states. Kiev has not officially came responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks.

Chancellor Kwanseh Quartang was set to address a regular meeting of lawmakers on Wednesday, but Truss has now expected to replace him.

And up next, hereby K2 Asset Management's George Borboros is still underweight China. This is Boomburg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. OK. This October, delegates will meet for the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. As questions mild about China's economy, COVID-0 policy, and foreign relations, President Xi Jinping is looking to secure an historic third term. Keep it tuned to Bloomberg for the up-to-the-minute coverage and expert analysis you need. Coverage begins October 16th with special Sunday programming on Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we are going to do. I think Chairman Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. We are going to get inflation back down. I am confident of that. It does not necessarily mean that prices are going to revert to the old prices. Myelas, on your portray, may not be going back down to $13. A trade. Well, my U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers there and Minneapolis Fed President Neil Kashkary on the Fed's inflation fight. Well, on its guests expects an elongated U-shaped global recovery and still is overweight when it comes to energy, financials and health.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1320,2022-10-10 00:15:19
13095," They are delivering consistent to their word and that it's providing additional demand destruction to deal with inflation. Is there a point where you're going to say it's time to buy long-term bonds? So many financial advisors and portfolio managers have said in sovereign fixed income, you want to be very short duration. We've seen big sell-offs in bond markets yields are a lot higher. Is there a point where you say, aha, time to move that trade from the short end to the long end? Yeah, there is. And another great question. Sometime in the next 12 months, if you're looking for guidance, we take it from the short perspective. It's very short duration still in that 3 to 5 year part of the curve. Senior Unsecured, we think high yield is a replacement at this stage of the cycle because of the impairments increasing at the margin to equities as a risk at the class. Putting that aside, great value in that 3 to 5 year senior Unsecured FRNs, but you are right, some form of extending duration. We're not quite there yet. And when you see that, that's a bit of a risk on. Look for those other predictive indicators for an increase, a slow down, this is increasing and an increasing rate. It's bad news, it's good news in a sense. And that is, we need more yield inversion for the 2-10s, for example, in the US and to come through. Yes, I'd like to be thinking we'll be brave enough to extend duration sometime in the next 12 months and I suspect that made it all come earlier, like this year, early next year. Sounds like there's no rush to make the move. But what about energy, you know, OPEC Plus, cut, output? It seems like a lot of advisors, portfolio managers are looking at energy in one form or another, whether it's crude or gas as a good place to be. Yeah, we'll park ourselves there, like many other active managers, and just a reinforced here. And it's probably not as a price of going to cut. It just means that the US is going to really lift its efforts. It can never influence OPEC from the 70s onwards. We already know that. But it needs to lift its effort to reinforce energy security. And if I may have a quick backdrop on that, something like Woodside, and you've got many like Exxon, Chevron, globally, but something with LNG in your portfolio up to 50% of your portfolio in the case of Woodside. I'm just using an example. It is a key transition fuel for the developing, you know, for 2030, 2040, 2050 targets in the emerging world for the 2060, 2070. So for a good 50 years ahead, the key transition fuel is energy in LNG format, gas in some form for the development developing world. And that's why it works so well in the portfolio, strong cash earnings. So we say that it's good meeting to long ago. And obviously, those companies that have got, obviously, petroleum in a revenue lock, BHP's, EXP, petroleum revenue for an up to Woodside. So I'm just just as an example, it is a key area that still got strong cash flow through a good tailwinds and will maintain that position with many active fund managers as an FYI. But it is a key part of the transition for the emerging developed world. So I mean, it's going to carry on for a while. And speaking of the emerging world over the weekend, Bloomberg, having a story about how a lot of emerging market assets are just about at the point where they're looking more attractive that they have been beaten up, that they've probably made me bottomed, that there's some of the central banks have been successful in attacking inflation and still allowing some growth. What do you think of that argument? And is there any emerging market you like? Yeah, not quite there yet. A lot of damage for the US dollar strength that will continue into emerging markets, sovereign debt and corporate debt coming out of this period. And in the central of that emerging markets is not all, you can't all bundle in one. We do like emerging Southeast Asia, so Indonesia, Malaysia, anything around Singapore is a good play. Emerging markets and parts of Central America and South America are good and also bad, depending on the economies and the transition and the change of governments and the less predictive nature of policy and energy security. And then emerging markets out of Meena seem to be a very strong transition into a big savings hub for the next 50 years. That's a good long term. And there's competition between Qatar, UAE, Omar and Saudi as they're changing those economies. I've just said a lot in that small period, but the point of the emerging markets, you're going to play it from regionals, different perspectives, manufacturing and Southeast Asia and some financials to savings and energy obviously in the Meena region.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1321,2022-10-10 00:24:18
13096," bring in Southeast Asian some financials to savings and energy obviously in the meaner region and a blend in South America. And then it's always good value. It just means there'll be probably better value going forward similar to what the German economy is like in German equity valuations. Every year for the last five years it looks like good value relative to S&P 500. They'll just be better value going forward. Until again, we get some certainty on US dollar weakness and a turnaround and the Federal Reserve increasing and a decreasing rate. It's enough to correct some stability in currency markets which will filter down to other risk assets. All right. Well, George, you've done a very thorough job of looking at the markets and the world with us. Thanks so much. George Wabar has had a research at K2 asset management.

What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. At the end of the winter, when our storages will be depleted, it is of paramount importance that we have a joint purchase procurement of gas so that we avoid to outbid each other but that we have a collective bargaining power and that we put that in place. As European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, let's check on how futures in Europe are opening. We've certainly seen a lot of downside pressure in the US, S&P, NASDAQ, many futures. You can see that this negativity carried over from Friday after the jobs report into the early week trading. The European stocks index 600 closed down 1.2 percent on Friday. Technology stocks underperforming because the jobs report looking so healthy relative to what the Fed's expectations are, what they're looking to do on policy continuing aggressive rate hikes completely supported that. So you can see the Euro stocks 50 futures down 8.8 percent. The MSCI down more than 1 percent. DAX, that's the German stock index down 3.4 percent. So clearly this has gone from jobs report to the beginning of the week or see where it heads next. We have that real restaurant. The",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1322,2022-10-10 00:28:16
13097," down three quarters of percent. So clearly this is, it has gone from a job report to the beginning of the week where see where it heads next. Yeah, that reality checks out. It does that in perhaps. Let's get a quick check of the latest business-lash headlines and Japanese printer make a sacre Epson may raise prices because of the chronic supply chain upheaval that's disrupted electronic firms around the world and an exclusive interview president and CEO Yasunori Ogawa told Bloomberg that demand for printers and work from home products is robust and that the company is doing its best to mitigate production losses. Logistical issues are continuing and the cost materials such as semi-conductor as well that remains high. This is a serious concern for us costs are rising significantly and we have strong demand. We're doing our best to control our costs as much as possible but sometimes we cannot do as much as we would like. Renault is said to be open to cutting its stake in Nissan. Source to say the partners are ramping up over talks over the French car maker's plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets due in early November. Wadot Nissan is pressing Renault to reduce its stake to 15% to even up the two car makers shares at each other. Changes in the economy and pressure on the banking sector in general caused the CEO Goldman Sachs to abandon plans to dominate in the world of retail banking. That's the focus our big take story today. Bloomberg-Seqin enjoins us to the expansion into a mainstream proved expensive. Yeah, Marcus was the name of the big dream and you know you don't have to think back too far to remember when FinTech was all the rage and Goldman CEO David Solomon spent the better part of the last four years pitching the benefits of a full service digital bank now with the bank under pressure that changing environment is forcing Goldman CEO to shake up his own dream for a new source of business. That big four in a mainstream handling money for the masses. They're reigning that back in you know at one point he jumped on a flight to meet Reese Witherspoon the movie star the star legally blonde. She later sold her own media empire for big money but she had wanted to offer her online legions of fans and online financial service and so Solomon was thinking Marcus could do the trick but look at the trajectory of Goldman Sachs stock down more than 20% this year all of that has created an environment where shareholders not that happy with Marcus and take a look at what they're doing the restructuring consumer service plans reigning in a lot of the consumer related plans such as credit cards and so this is a restructuring of the big foray in a retail banking. Little slim down back to you. Bloomberg's again and there we don't want to come this is Bloomberg.

Welcome to the world of decentralized finance Bloomberg's covering all things crypto the people the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative like just be honest we've had sort of a shift in our we in some sort of circulation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. Now let's get to the first word headlines South Korea says it's military will be a security cooperation with US and Japan including the deployment of what it calls US strategic assets this comes after North Korea test fired two more missiles on Sunday.

13099," It's not something that I'm very optimistic about. Catherine Lemme, Blueberg Intelligence Senior, unless they're well taking a look at our markets, the channel are likely to reopen in less than half an hour's time. So it's been a big week that they miss and mix signals for investors. That's right, Heidi, because you have what? Catherine was just talking about the week read through that came in the China Golden Week and also you have that spike in cover cases that Catherine was just talking about now. So these are all, of course, negatives ahead of the open. But then you've also got to take a look at what we saw in the proxies. So how assets in the off-shore market performed during this period? We actually did see some pretty solid gains here, particularly in what we saw, not only for these ETFs here that are listed in New York, but also for the futures there gaining more than 2%. So these are obviously tailwinds, also supported by those moves that we did have globally for stocks, because they were still higher over the past five sessions, even though we did see that slump into the weekend following the US jobs. And that certainly is also something that will be weighing on Chinese stocks if you change on now ahead of the open today. Because we did have, of course, those US jobs numbers, certainly cementing the risk or the chances of the 75 basis point height from the Fed at the next meeting, also possibly in December. And that risk of tone is going to be really hard for traders in China to be ignoring today, plus when you add those other factors, like you were to saying, Kathleen, we had the private reading of the services PMI into contractual territory for the first time in four months. You had President Biden expanding the restrictions on China's access to chip technology. So the odds of a sustained rally here looking pretty small, particularly when you look at the performance of the Hang-Seng China Enterprises Index over the past week. So you had that bounce here, but then that fell off into the weekend, and so that really sets us up. Also what we see in the offshore yuan, quick look at this terminal chart here. The fixing, very important today, we'll be getting in about half an hour's time from now. We did have a bit of a move higher for the offshore yuan, but the onshore will be particularly closely watched, given we did have that record run of stronger than expected fixes to try and shore up Kathleen, those losses in the onshore currency. Yeah, thanks Annabelle. Chinese markets are open today after the Golden Week holiday. So let's discuss what to expect now. Joining us from Chengdu is the CIO Grow Investment Group, William Ma. So William, I'm sure you just heard the report from Catherine talking about how disappointing the holiday week sales were. I mean, you know, trips booked by rail down sharply, cinnamon tickets plunged, and then we get the Cushing PMI services number, having a pretty bad pullback. Are you more concerned about the economy? Are you less positive now on Chinese equities than you were? Well, actually, we're building exposure in particular to consumer stable sector. Just one more point, you know, on the domestic consumption during the Golden Week, we have actually seen mixed message. You know, when I talk to my friends, they are not traveling outside the provinces, but within the provinces, you know, they're going to the mountains, they're going to the theme park. You look at the theme park tickets, you know, on a year-on-year basis, they're increased by about 100%. So I think consumption is kind of like you don't mix. But having said that, you know, we're building exposure ahead of the party because we're expecting more policy announcements support, you know, after the party congressed. What kind of positive policy announcements are you expecting? There are three very important indicators, you know, you must have to watch out for. Number one, who would be the new premier? If you like, I think, you know, are premiered with a very pro-economy policy. We'll be very supportive to the market center and stimulus. The number two investors are watching out for is the potential, you know, step-by-step announcement of the COVID policies changes. Like, you know, we are expecting the government to announce the next three months, the next six months, you know, what are the steps of opening up? I think people are expecting the clarity of visibility, a plan for opening up. So people are waiting. The third one would be to watch is in November this year. The new premier is going to announce the budget for next year. And then whether the budget will be huge, you know, stimulus, physical and monetary support, I think those are the three factors that you must have watching for. So we're expecting a market rebound, you know, after the party congress, because those indicators will be more clear after the party congress. Here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1325,2022-10-10 00:41:37
13100," watching for. So we're expecting a market rebound, you know, after the party congress, because those indicators would be more clear after the party congress. If there's no update to a pathway out of COVID-0, does that really have any potential upside? Yeah, if there is no further update on the party congress, I think the consumer stable sector or some of the sector like government supporting like the electric vehicle will be continue to go up, but the overall sentiment would be quite, you know, rippling because people are actually expecting more, you know, civil COVID policy update. I think that is one of the key indicator people are expecting to change the economy outlook, you know, for the Q4 next year. When it comes to tech, evaluations low enough for that to be interesting yet is the regulatory overhang over or is there further uncertainty to go? Yeah, for the big tech, I will still remain on the conservative tip side because the whole, you know, big tech evaluation has been go there and I believe global investor when they come to China and Asia, they are looking for growth. We are not expecting a double digit, you know, earnings growth for the big tech, you know, next year anymore. So I believe, you know, when the investor coming in, they're looking for either the more faster sector or the most, you know, stable sector, you know, kind of let the food and beverages, the domestic consumption, like the good manufacturer compared to the big tech. So I think the era for, you know, high tech, high growth area for those platform company has gone until they go back to the kind of like double digit earnings growth. You know, one of your contrarian calls is buying justress assets from China AMC. I'm curious, you know, and more broadly, there's a lot of distressed property, you know, companies right now. Who do you like there of anybody? Yeah, I think it's not named specific, but rather we are seeing a change of the consumption kind of like pattern. Some of the younger generation instead of fine houses in Shanghai and Beijing, now they are renting, you know, surface apartments. So now is a good time for investor, you know, to take a fine page of the real estate developer selling core asset at 30% plus this account and then remodel it and then rent it out. So those are the niche, you know, opportunity real estate is a big sector in China market. So I think, you know, we are more interesting in this type of strategy rather than, you know, buying the offshore real estate, born, you know, at this account, I believe investor could be more long term in participating, this restructuring of this distress opportunity. Well, in March, the IO Grow Investment Group, really great having you with us. We'll come up next, the current economic climate and security crises are making this a uniquely challenging time for policymakers. We're taking a closer look at the multiple shocks facing global commerce in our G20 spotlight next. This is Bloomberg. I'm going to be watching retail earnings from both Home Depot and Walmart. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Alongside some cane, at least around the some, Jonathan Farrah. Across the board, these are good numbers. In a big headline, there is reaffirming the outlook. How much does this give faith that you can get some sort of resurgence in consumer spending? Bloomberg surveillance. Be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1326,2022-10-10 00:45:20
13101," We're just weeks to go until G-20 heads of state gathered for their big summit in Bali. We're putting the spotlight on some of the key issues they're facing in the post-pandemic era. We're looking at the economic, climate and security crisis making a unique challenging time. Today we're looking at how these are affecting world trade. The world trade organizations' global merchandise trade will slow next year as multiple shocks, including the Ukraine War, high energy crisis and central bank hikes raise manufacturing costs and squeeze households. We'll also get a read from some of the biggest economies with trade data out this week, including Japan, China and the EU. Heidi? We'll get some more from Maplenberg, Chief Asia Economics, Coruscant and Ender Curran, who joins us now. So Ender, we talk about this unique set of challenges that global policy makers find themselves confronting. Yes. So, one of the big stories, one of the big economic stories from the pandemic, Heidi, was this extraordinary boom in merchandise trade. We know what was happening. Consumers around the world were buying the kind of goods and kit that they need to work from home, study from home, and their lifestyle is adapted. That's all now on winding, that the man from merchandise goods is coming off. You're seeing that most pronounced in East Asia. We're seeing it in PMI readings. We're seeing it in South Korean trade data. We're obviously seeing it in China's trade data. And it is because, as you mentioned, there's so much going on now. You have that kind of post-pandemic shift happening, but you also have inflation, higher mortgage repayments. You have the European energy crisis, the war in Ukraine. And all of these are pointing towards a big slowdown in trade. As you mentioned, the WTO, for example, are talking about merchandise trade growth next year of 1%, just to give you some perspective on that last year trade growth in the world was around 10%. So, it is a big shift that's happening. And it does mean that one of the big drivers of the global economic recovery from the pandemic, which was the boom in merchandise trade, that is now coming off and coming off quite sharply. So, what is that going to mean for global trade relationships? We spoke earlier to Marie Ning. She's the Canada's trade minister. And they're pushing hard to get the CPTP off the ground. They are doing all kinds of trade agreements in Asia broadly. Is this going to slow down going to slow those kinds of measures down, those efforts to make the globalized trade further? Well, at the very least, what's happening in the world of merchandise trade is there's a lot of conversation around reshoring, on-shoring, friend-shoring and the like, Kathleen. And that's all part of the political backdrop too. Companies are looking at ways to cut costs and to bring production home in a way that it's cheaper for them to serve as customers, where customers are actually buying. We know that that's the headline takeaway for what's happening. But actually the data is not showing a dramatic shift in terms of merchandise companies pulling their production out of, say, China, for example, or pulling their production out of Asia, bringing it back to Europe in a significant way. That's yet to show through in the data. I don't think anyone expects multilateral trade agreements to turn around a global trade story either because that's all about declining demand. And of course, that's not something to do whether or not a trade agreement is in place. There are some bright spots though, it should be said, services trade is expected to be a growth area going forward because people are traveling again for tourism and education. That's especially the case in Southeast Asia, for example. So when we talk about the big decline in trade, it is happening due to slow down and demand for merchandise goods. Multilateral trade agreements won't change that. But as I say to you, the bright spots keep an eye on our what's going to happen to tourism, what's going to happen to education spend. Those are big export markets for lots of countries too. All right. The achieve Asia economic correspondent and the current. We'll talk around the UK's accession into the CPTPP continued over the weekend. Canada's international trade minister, Mary Eing, says the UK's bid to join one of Asia's big trade packs will take a bit longer. This is the first session requests. We've always said to CPTPP partners that the high quality of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1327,2022-10-10 00:50:30
13102," big trade packs will take a bit longer. This is the first session requests. We've always said to CPTPP partners that the high quality of this agreement, the gold standard agreement that CPTPP is, we encourage any aspiring economy wishing to join to meet those high standards and that they would be welcomed. So we are very much working with the United States, rather the United Kingdom, on this agreement and on their session. Japan is the chair for the UK Ascension process, so they're taking a really leadership role here as part of the CPTPP partners. But our first session, so we are absolutely working with the United Kingdom on this. What about the issues when it comes to China and Taiwan potentially their involvement? Well we've always said that this agreement is a high standard agreement. We welcome those wishing to join to meet those high standards, but this is also the first session. And the first session is with the United Kingdom. We as the CPTPP partners want to get it right. And so we're taking our time to make sure we do get it right through this first session with the UK. There's a big push into Southeast Asia, including one of the Singapore as the trading hub. Why the focus on this region? Where do you see, I guess, the benefits for all of the parties involved, and particularly where do you see the growth opportunities for Canada within Southeast Asia? Well terrific question. I mean, that's Canada's trade minister, but also the small business minister, and the mandate that I have from my prime minister and our government's commitment is to diversify and grow opportunities for market access around the world. I mean, Canada is the only G7 country that has a free trade agreement with every other country. This region is dynamic. It is growing. We already have the CPTPP. We are at the negotiating table with the ASEAN countries, as well as bilateral negotiations with Indonesia, which is where I'm heading to later this afternoon. So making sure that we diversify and grow into this market and into this region is extremely important. Canada is a trading country. Two-thirds of our economy is dependent on trade. One out of six jobs is related to trade. So as a trading country, creating opportunities into this region is important. I announced a Canadian trade gateway anchored here in Singapore, and the way that will work is that I want people to see this as Canada's front door to the region, but the door swings both ways. So I want to see the region having a place to learn more about Canada. Where do investing Canada and how we can collaborate together so that the trade really is both ways benefiting the region, but also Canada. A slightly different topic, but I'm wondering about progress made with the U.S. to bring it into the minimum corporate tax in line with the OEC agreement agreement of 15 percent. I know that's important to Canada as well. How is that going? We are working very hard and very focused on this important multilateral agreement through the OECD, of which the U.S. is part of. So we're at the table and we are working hard and hoping that what we will get at is a conclusion of this multilateral agreement reached with the OECD partners, including the U.S. Minister, I'm wondering how important a multilateral approach is in Asia with Canada and some of its partners, including the likes of Korea, that this multi-pronged strategy is also to counter China's weight across the region. Is that very significant in terms of avoiding a situation where you see multiple trading partners being pitted against each other? Well for Canada, it is really important that we continue to diversify and to provide opportunities for our exporters and for our businesses. We often talk in Canada about having a creating economy that works for all as the small business minister but also Canada's trade minister, helping businesses, whether they are women entrepreneurs, indigenous own businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, take, get the benefits of trade and to make sure that workers get the benefit of the trade means diversifying and looking into markets that are high growth markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1328,2022-10-10 00:54:10
13103," is take, get the benefits of trade and to make sure that workers get the benefit of the trade means diversifying and looking into markets that are high growth markets. We're talking about opportunities in the digital economy. We are increasingly finding partners to grow the green economy, to diversify and create those, that growth in green growth in Canada. We're doing so with partners in this region, whether it be Korea, whether it be Japan, whether it's here in Singapore and with the many partners that are absolutely in the CPTPP, as I said, we've seen the growth in trade with our partners who are here and we're looking to do more of that. The Canadian Minister of International Trade, Mary and they're speaking to us earlier. As we count down to the G-27, it will be having more analysis on the challenges that group faces on Mondays at 8.40am Hong Kong time here on Bloomberg Television. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, with you're always, always working. The global market has really ended the week with a very strong US job state. And that pretty much erased the bulk of the gains that we saw in global stocks last week. And the yuan didn't really do that well over the Golden Week holiday, either. It eaked out a tiny gain versus a dollar. And over the weekend, we actually saw a draft of really bad news in terms of consumer spending. We see tourism spending down about a quarter from a year ago and the number of trips taken also down about 36% from a year ago. And also we had a Biden administration issuing new curves against the Chinese tax sector, making it more difficult for US suppliers to export technology and their products to China. So we'll be watching very closely at the chip sector at the open as well. Overall, I think we probably will see a bit of a pop at the open, but overall I don't think it's going to last. I think there's a lot of negative sentiment in the world right now, certainly when it comes to stocks. Bloomberg's managing editor for Asian stocks, the young team too. Well, that's it from daybreak Asia. Our market's coverage continues as we look ahead to the start of trade in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shen Sen. So stand by for Bloomberg markets, China open. We'll see if this negativity is going to just continue to see through Asian markets. For our election.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1329,2022-10-10 00:58:10
13104," Standby for Bloomberg markets. China Open will see if this negativity is going to just continue to seep through Asian markets. We know the holiday week spending was not so great. And again, these strong U.S. jobs numbers, which depress stocks, pretty sharply on Friday continuing to probably go across Asia and the rest of the world. So that you joined us. This is Bloomberg. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. Late on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. Isn't possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean, that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life family isn't becoming more digital. I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah, I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall, and estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blitz and turns on the way, and the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1330,2022-10-10 01:02:17
13105," This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the future. We are going to be doing this now being with us. The 90 I'm in Beijing at Hong Kong. Welcome to Blue Moon Market. It's China Open. I'm Yvonne Mann. Our top series this morning, markets of dude after strong U.S. job data reinforced chances of more aggressive fed rate hikes and China's COVID shadow looms large as mainland markets reopen after the Golden Week holiday early indicator show consumption plummeting. Plus semiconductor stocks and focus as fresh U.S. curbs on China's access to chip tech add to the industries. Wows. It's certainly going to be a big one to watch here the semiconductor industry given just how demand and what we saw with Samsung that alarming earnings report on Friday on how this all fair is in terms of the geopolitics of course. But as we mentioned the China reopen is what we are building up to again. It doesn't look like we're going to be seen with a good backdrop here as well. Key to watch though a lot of markets are closed. So not much really clarity though but Japan South Korea Taiwan Malaysia are clothes U.S. will also be shut as well. So China is reopening after what has been sort of I could as you can say a bumper week when it comes to equities although towards the second half things looking a little bit dower but yeah it was that U.S. job support on Friday which is basically sorry the mood here this morning where we have seen the jobless rate go down still wanting to a hot labor market. This is how the bond market is fairing as well. If you take a look where futures are right now U.S. futures are also in the rest. Singapore is down about 8 tens of 1 percent. U.R. scene bond futures pretty much flakster this morning but yields in Australia and New Zealand all ticking higher. In fact when it comes to U.S. tenure yield long as weekly up streets since 1984. I think we're racking up about 11 straight weeks now and we're taking a look at when it comes to effects of course a dollar moves will be very present here today the Remden B but fix also we'll see if the PBOC is going to keep a pretty tight leash ahead of the party Congress just about a week away. $145 a year and here this morning your offshore rate is at 713 22 we're watching you're a watch of a pound very closely. The China tourism numbers were not good. So revenue falling about a quarter year on year you're talking about ticket sales air traffic at air ticket sales also did fall when it came to the chai seeing PMI services numbers that came out over the weekend also pretty bad as well first contraction we've seen since May not looking good 713 22 for your offshore right here right now Chinese tenure yields were a basis point lower we're watching Brent crew very closely as well just given the China demand picture the China reopening story as well after commodities had a pretty decent week last week but a 50 futures look at that down about 1.1% in Singapore here this morning so what really is the trigger here it continues to be the federal reserve and central banks basically no seeing signs of pivot just yet right to go away from the jobs data on Friday as we mentioned right basically saying things are looking still hot 263 thousand jobs in September the fed likely it's going to have to keep on that aggressive hiking path and basically what this means for this week right a lot of the time we're a lot of interest when it comes to inflation numbers coming out but here's what from our market watchers have been talking about here just last week. I came in right under the nose in line with expectations it's solid good news for those in the soft landing or the moderation camp it's a little bit disappointing to the to the dovish camp the labor market is slowing but is really not weakening little bit reinforcing to the hawkish camp we saw uniformly from from Fred president talking about a continued hawkish narrative and this this just be into that it's still an exceptionally strong labor market and here lies the challenge for the fed it's all about the fed it's got to keep going it's going to keep the fed on track for 75 basis point move at the next meeting think you get a 75 you'll probably get another 50 we get to make another 25 the fed's going to keep at it there's nothing in this this report that is going to suggest to them that they need to pull back",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1331,2022-10-10 01:07:22
13106," You probably got another 50. We get divided another 25. The Fed's going to keep at it. There's nothing in this this report that is going to suggest to them that they need to pull back. It's price to get really tight and the markets are reacting to that. And it's about to get busy as well. We're not quite done yet. You know, we come to the US inflation numbers that comes out 8.1% is the estimate for this time around. Maybe signs of maybe cooling inflation, but certainly we got to watch the PPI numbers coming out on Wednesday as well. The Fed minutes on Wednesday. We have India CPI numbers also China CPI numbers. So quite a lot there. We're also looking for some GDP numbers of Singapore, the MAS decision as well and B.O.K. that's the one to watch on Wednesday. Keep in mind IMF, that's all kicking off this week as well. We have earnings coming through from the banks. So it is looking pretty busy as well. And let's talk a little more about China first and foremost. Traders returning from the Golden Week holiday, set to face conflicting signals and really mitigating the market's chances of playing catch up to the small events that we saw in Global Stocks last week for more let's bring in our Bloomberg Asia Stocks managing editor, Lansing too. Lansing, lots of bad news for China over the past week. What are we looking for in terms of the reopen today? Yeah, if you just look at the futures and as you shown on your screen just now, it's down 1% for FTSE China 850. So that's not really building well. I think aside from all the bad tourism data and consumption data that came out over the weekend for the Golden Week, we're also looking at a lot of geopolitical tensions. The Biden and the administration just announced late Friday, new curves on chip export or technology export for Chinese technology companies. And that's that's really not good for the sector overall. And also there is a bit of a ramp up of tensions between China and Taiwan. So I think that kind of macro headwinds are really going to weigh on on Chinese traders at the reopen. And what sectors in particular is your team looking out for today at the open? Yeah, we're looking out for the tourism, you know, railway flights. That's kind of a reopening stock. So we're also looking at cinema, make cinema operators and as well as chip sector as we were talking about that. That was really the biggest news over the sort of Friday to weekend period. And that sector usually will gain when there is curves from the U.S. But we'll see how it pains out today. All right, Nancy. Thank you, Nancy, to there are agents talks managing editor joining us from Singapore. Yeah, there has been some signs though, right? People were talking about Xi Jinping, mass list is on these national day holiday events that he appeared in. The Beijing marathon is also back. So people are hoping that maybe that means COVID-19 could be seen some news after the party Congress. Let's talk about Jonathan Garner, Morgan Stanley, Chief Asian, EM Stragist, out with a report that came out maybe last week, basically upgrading Asia EM equities. Maybe that we're seeing signs of a trough here right now. Jonathan, great to talk to you. We spoke to you just about three weeks ago. You said not quite there yet. What's really changed in your eyes now? Well, in our view, we are now at or around a trough and we had major declines in middle of August all the way through to the end of September, which took us down to some exceptionally low valuations about 10 times forward PE for the EM index. That's actually below where we troughed in the COVID recession or 2018. It's one of the lowest multiples we seen other than the global financial crisis. And at the same time, some of the internals within the market, particularly the underperformance of career and semiconductors took those markets to really exceptionally low valuations. Are there, I mean, what sort of response have you gotten from clients right now? I think it's quite a bold call to be seen that maybe we're seeing a floor now, just given the macro weakness that we've seen. People are talking about tech downturn after that Samsung earnings that came out on Friday as well. What are some of the new term risks to that sort of conviction that you have now? Yeah, so this is a call out through the course of next year. It's a big call from us. It's sort of analogous to the downgrade we did in early 2021 on EM and China. And there's an enormous debate. We've been exceptionally busy in responding to client inquiries about this. I guess you've covered a lot on your show just listening to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1332,2022-10-10 01:11:49
13107," And there's an enormous debate. We've been exceptionally busy in responding to client inquiries about this. I guess you've covered a lot on your show, just listening to the intro before I came on about the bad news that's out there. But markets tend to trough on bad news when it's abundant. There's a lot of debate about the direction of Fed policy, the dollar and the S&P. And then obviously, again, how China after the party congress is going to evolve. And what are you expecting for the party congress coming up this weekend as well? People are saying that maybe we'll get some signs of maybe the easing of COVID-0 policy. Is that just wishful thinking? I would say that in terms of market expectations, there's much less optimism than there was in the summer. And we would agree with that. We're very unlikely to see any kind of big bang easing, but a gradual easing of approach over a matter of months, which leads to a pick up in growth from really very low levels now. I think that's a reasonable base case. And don't get on the property side. We've already got some important measures that are flowing through to actually clear the inventory and to enhance, for example, some of the developers in terms of their ability to issue credit on shore. So there is easing in the pipeline of a more conventional form in China already. And can you walk us through, you know, you mentioned that there's been a lot of debate. Do you think EM can still recover if US markets are still kind of seeing a lot of pressure here and what we're seeing across DM? Yes, we do. A really key part of our report is to understand that EM equities are early cycle. And within EM, career in Taiwan, the two markets that we're bullish on and the semiconductor and tech hardware stocks, you know, they have a track record of troughing on very bad news, like those Samsung operating numbers that you mentioned that came out actually after we wrote our report. But that idea that actually the worst of the news now is Q3, Q4 this year. And when we're in the second half of next year, the year-on-year comparable sort of inflected back up again, that's why we think stocks are troughing. And we've managed to trough in EM four out of the prior 10 markets before the S&P, including most recently in the 2018 cycle, when EM equities troughed at the end of October, but the S&P didn't trough until the end of December. And there's some quite important analogies between now and then in terms of the debate about the Fed, how long will they carry on hiking, and how long will they carry on doing QT? Where, you mentioned the rotation to tech. Just walk us a little bit more about how you are advising to at least investors on where they need to be shifting and changing the portfolio sector by sector. Yeah, so given that we're upgrading two very large markets, and one huge sector, the whole semi-tech hardware sector, we're downgrading elsewhere. So we're recommending taking profits on overweights on Indonesia and Singapore to defensive markets that have hugely up-formed here today. We're taking those down to neutral. And more controversially, we're putting in place an outright underweight on India. India is really in a completely different valuation paradigm from the rest of our coverage. It's trading at the 95th percentile of its forward PE range, about 22 times forward PE. That means, versus, for example, career two and a half times the multiple. That's a record valuation premium for India relative to career. All right, Jonathan. We'll have more on those calls here, of course. As you mentioned, quite a bold one as well. We'll get to your take more from Morgan Stanley. He's staying with us for the first half of this show. In the meantime, let's get you caught up with the first word news. We have Vani Quinn in New York. Hey, Vani. Hey, Vani. Thank you and good morning. China is being hit by a rebound in COVID-19 cases following the Golden Week holidays.

So we're talking about maybe about 300 pips or so of a stronger bias though. So maybe not as strong as the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1334,2022-10-10 01:20:09
13109," open out of that Golden Week holiday, 70992. So we're talking about maybe about 300 pips or so of a stronger bias, though. So maybe not as strong as we've seen of late, but certainly one to watch here as we get count down to that party Congress as well. They're probably going to keep a pretty tight leash leading up to that big event here. We're at 71327 for your offshore rate right now. Let's get to one of our top stories as well. China has criticized the US move to expand restrictions on its access to semiconductor technologies, saying that they will harm supply chains and the world economy. President Biden announced the export curbs on Friday. We certainly saw when it comes to the Philly semiconductor index falling some 6% on the back of all those bad news. Let's bring in Peter L. Strum here on what the impact of this sort of these curbs could be for the tech sector. And Peter, this all coming at a time when the consumer demand has been faltering too. Yeah, that's right. First to start with the new US restrictions on trade with China. There are really two big categories that the Commerce Department announced. One, they announced a series of new restrictions on what kind of chips and chip making equipment can be exported to China. This will touch on things like AI chips and also advanced semiconductor equipment that could be used by companies in China to make chips for everything from supercomputers to the military. The second category is that 31 companies were added to something the Commerce Department calls the unverified list. These are companies that they view as a potential risk in trading negotiation. So in the past, the unverified list wasn't as restrictive as it is now. Now the Commerce Department is saying that these 31 companies cannot buy broad swans of technology from the US. How far do these curbs go, Peter, in terms of the impact it could have on companies out there? Obviously, the US might have to do with a lot of this, but even just chip companies that have operations in China who are non-US may also be impacted. Yeah, it's a dramatic step to dramatic increase in the restrictions on trade with China. Just to pull back a little bit, of course. The US has led the semiconductor industry for many years now with South Korean Taiwan and particularly they have the most advanced chip making design firms and manufacturing firms anywhere. China's been trying to build up this domestic capability for many years. They view this as the foundation of the tech industry in a central. So this will handicap China's ability to build that domestic chip industry in very serious ways. Peter, thank you, Peter Lstrom. There are Agent Tech executive editor on the latest on these curbs that we got out of the US on Friday. Jonathan Garner is still with us. Morgan Stanley, Chief Agent, EM Stragis. This news, Jonathan. How does that impact, I guess, your call about upgrading tech in Asia? Yeah, I think there's a number of points to make about this. Firstly, we've been going through this for almost four years now since the Trump administration. So we've had things that have been very stock-specific on multiple occasions in the past that have affected particularly Chinese equities. If you look at, as your correspondent was saying, what's really going on here, it's about the high end of chip manufacture with very specialized processes and techniques. And in particular, the semi-equipment names, which are more represented in the SOX index than they are, for example, in Cosby or Taiwan. And again, I would say that if you look at China itself from a growth perspective, it's very different from a few years ago. It's contributing only mid-single digit to global growth right now. So if you actually look at where global growth is coming from, it's really coming from the US and some other parts of EM, like India and Indonesia, so in terms of future growth for chip products, China is not as central as it was a few years ago. How does China fit into that call that you have about this rally that we're about to see in EM in particular? And the tech sector, as you mentioned, how much conviction can we have and our valuations at least cheap enough for you to maybe start nibbling at that sector? You have valuations in China are, again, extremely cheap. Nine times forward from SCI China, at the Asia Financial Crisis Low Evaluation for...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1335,2022-10-10 01:24:48
13110," Valuations are in China are again extremely cheap, 9 times forward from a CI China, at the Asia financial crisis low valuation for Hang Seng. In terms of the actual performance of the market going forward, a lot will hinge on what we covered in the previous segment how we come out of the party congress. You know, within the China market, we're still broadly cautious on big cap internet names and private sector names that have been impacted by regulatory reset. And that's why in terms of actually the call that we're making, it's really leading with career in Taiwan and I'm waiting a bit to assess the situation in China on multiple dimensions, one of which of course is geopolitics, so US-China relations and things like this action for Chinese importation of advanced semiconductors. All right, and we are flashing some pretty early moves here in the pre-market, leading up to that open as well. When it comes to travel sector, obviously, there was some doubling down of COVID-0 from Xi Jinping, also the tech space as well, just given these curves that we heard from the US as well. So the chip sector very much in focus at the open, we'll have more, which I think, garnered here from Morgan Stanley when China does reopen. So everything from chips, China-related stocks as well, that we're very much in focus, holiday spending falls, we talk about air ticket sales, tourism revenue. It doesn't really paint a pretty good picture here, and people are looking for a catalyst, and everyone's still hoping that this party congress will see something, but we have plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg. Idiot! What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance, Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions and the technology, Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. This is Bloomberg Market China Open and Bonnie Quinn and the latest business flash headlines. Australian law firm Maurice Blackburn has filed a complaint against mobile phone operator Optus, claiming it failed to protect the personal information of its customers. Last month the data of almost 10 million former and current Optus customers was hacked. Maurice Blackburn says thousands of customers have already registered their details with the firm and the complaint to the Australian Information Commissioner is said to be one of the largest ever. India's Mint is reporting that Gautam Adani and his family are in early discussions with investors to raise at least 10 billion dollars. The report says potential investors include Tomasak, GIC and other wealth and private equity funds. The government says the capital would be used to fund the group's expansion plan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1336,2022-10-10 01:28:44
13111," For wealth and private equity funds, Mint says the capital would be used to fund the group's expansion plans in keen energy, ports and cement. Renault has said to be open to cutting its stake in Nissan. Sources say the partners are ramping up talks over the French carmaker's plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets due in early November. We're told Nissan is pressing Renault to reduce its stake to 15% to even up the two carmaker's shares in each other. Let's see if we can get those through right business dash headlines. Iván. All right, Bonnie, thanks so much. We're just a few minutes. We have an open train in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong. Because we're watching out for here today. We take a look at when it just comes to the holiday after Golden Week and basically how Chinese markets perform. For the most part, you actually do see that you do get some returns here. I think 2018 was a bit of an exception here, given that it was the trade war and the light, but that 10-year average is slightly just close to about 1% or more. So maybe that could be something of an indicator, although it takes a lot of proxies as well. We actually did see some pretty decent gains here when it comes to some of these ETFs to light. But take a look at the A50 futures, though. We continue to extend those deep declines about 2% as well. It could be a pretty interesting open coming up. The agenda, watching, of course, a lot of credit data come out this week. This is Bloomberg. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for my life. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. You're watching Blue Moon Markets China Open. It is the big reopen here after the Golden Week holiday, although we are seeing signs that the pre-market now looking too good. Just given what we saw in terms of consumption over this week as well, tourism revenue falling from 26% from a year ago. You have air ticket sales, cinema box sales not looking good as well. The party congress is just a week away as well. But certainly the music still looks pretty dull. Not just when it comes domestically in China, but we're talking about externally as well. With that very strong job support that we got on Friday, the U.S., we're not seeing a whole lot of visibility given a lot of markets in Asia are also closed as well. Korea, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, I should say, and Malaysia as well here today. But 1.6% lower when it comes to the Hang Seng. You're seeing your futures are lower by 2% this morning out of China. So it seems like it's more of a catch-down story than catch-up despite what some of these proxies had showed just last week. But you are seeing here a flat open when it comes to Shanghai. I will see how this all plays.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1337,2022-10-10 01:33:27
13112," just last week, but you are seeing here a flat open when it comes to Shanghai. We'll see how this all plays out here, but MSCI China will lower about 1.6% at the get-go. Shen Zhen looking a little bit better. We're seeing gains about four tens of 1%. So it looks like things are at least slow going, but still seeing some green here this morning. Let's flip the boards watching what bonds, modities, and effects are doing here. We are seeing a 28th straight day the PBOC has sent that strong and that expected fixing. It was about 300 pips or so. We are seeing some strength crossing when it comes to CNY. 713-21 for your off-shore rate, though. We did see some decent gains in the first part of last week. It seemed to evaporate a little bit once we got close to the last part of the week last week, but it seems like at least today the dollar is a little bit on the back foot here. 272 for your Chinese 10-year yields, so yields are lower by two basis points. Crew, take a look at that 10% gains on the back of what we've been seeing. So that's definitely a catch-up trade here when it comes to crew futures in China. Hang saying, wow, not looking pretty though, H's tech, we're seeing 3.3% lower here. There's morning, H shares are just below that 6,000 level, and we're watching the Hang saying 2.5% or less lower here this morning. It still continues to be that Fed story. We're an aggressive Fed. You have inflation numbers coming out later on this week. The U.S., it seems like we're another kind of strong print away from yet another bad sell-off here. But let's take a look at what it comes to stocks that we're watching out for. We talked about the geopolitics with the DC side of things, new chip technology curves. China has responded saying this is really going to harm recovery. This is really going to shake up supply chains once again. You are seeing likes of SMIC, Huahong-Semi. Look at that, down some 4 to 5%. Will Semi-conductor also down some 3%? Wushy Biologic, that's kind of the flip side. One of their units removed from that U.S. unverified list there. So, upside for that stock here this morning. Flip of the boards. We're also watching when it comes to not just the property space, a cattle as well. CIC is the slashing that price target by about 20%. They said Fed-high export concerns there. Not much moving for the stock at this point. But we talked about Billy Billy as well. There's been some talk about some reviews of some of these stocks here. Hong Kong listed that may have more mainland access. Those that carry weighted voting rights will be closely watched on Monday here today as the exchange operator telling investors and officials will be conducting assessments for inclusion into these trading links with the mainland. We're watching the travel stocks as well. It's a pretty mixed picture across the board here. But everything that we saw when it came to Golden Week wasn't too golden. We kind of knew that expecting that leading up to this. But you're saying that when Macau are now some 4.2%, safety holdings. That was the one big underperformer last. What were we saw? The bond stocks, their record lows. A lot of questions about their debt repayments here. We're seeing a bit of upside here at least today for that stock. But yeah, it doesn't look too good right now. Still with us, the Jonathan Gardner, Morgan Stanley, Chief Asia and EAM Stragists. Who has given us some good news at least on this Monday morning. But they're calling signs and at least showing signs of a trough here when it comes to these markets. How's the dollar kind of change, or maybe it doesn't change in any way, to give you such a more optimistic outlook when it comes to EAM? Are we seeing signs of a peak on the greenback? Yeah, the dollar has been exceptionally strong. In fact, on some measures, it's sort of 40-year high. I think what's important here in Asia is that the corresponding weakness that we're seeing, for example, in the Japanese yen, the Korean won the Taiwan dollar, these actually help margins for the big cap exporters from our geography, just at the same time as they damage margins for some of the constituents of the S&P 500. So these moves have been so large that whatever your debate is about top-line revenue growth and where the global economy overall is going, there's going to be some sort of different cutting of the pie as it were in terms of corporate profitability that arises from these dollar trends. And you mentioned about Japan, how does a weaker yen then impact your view? I mean, you mentioned Japan is one of your favorite markets right now. Yeah, we've had Japan as a defensive overweight this year, FX Hedged. And we made one change in our note last week, which is to recommend taking off the hedge for the dollar-based investor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1338,2022-10-10 01:38:20
13113," We've had Japan as a defensive overweight this year, FX hedged. And we made one change in our note last week, which is to recommend taking off the hedge for the dollar-based investor. Now we can clearly see the Bank of Japan intervening to slow the pace of decline of the yen for the first time since 1998. But FX hedged Japan equities are actually up year to date, so have proved to be defensive, along with markets like Indonesia and Singapore. Japan's trading about 12.0 times forward PE, so that's basically at a 10 year low, and also very cheap relative to S&P 500 with that tailwind for the exporters of the yen weakness we've already had. Does that, you know, unheijing things for currency? I mean, does that sort of play apply for all markets across EM or in Asia as well? Because we continue to see a lot of weakness across a lot of the Asian markets that you cover. Well, as Japan is a major developed sovereign with highly developed financial markets, and as Japanese rates are so much lower than US rates, you're actually paid to hedge the yen this year. So it actually adds two dollar returns to have the hedge on. It's not possible to hedge in large size some of the currencies that one has here in Asia, such as for example, Indonesian rupee or even Indian rupee. So we don't typically make currency hedge recommendations except for Japan, which was a big call for us until last week. And so, I mean, it gets to my earnings then, your outlook as well. Obviously, FX is going to be one of the key factors we're watching out for. What are you being watching out for in the quarter? Things are looking pretty depressed. Are we seeing any signs of maybe things are looking a little bit more, maybe brighter? Yeah, we're looking for a really, really bad quarter. And as I mentioned to you, with names that we put in our focus lists last week like Samsung Electronics, LG Display, SK, Hinex, even TSMC, we're anticipating the third quarter just pass that will be announced and the fourth quarter will be the trough in what are very cyclical markets and stocks. So, to that extent, the debate with clients is just how bad are things now? And will we get a normal cycle versus an alternative view that maybe we enter, you know, like a multi-year slowdown in tech spending? Now, that is too extreme a view. It's the inverse of where many people were in early 2021, where they weren't anticipating the cyclicality that was caused by the brought forward demand for these goods during the COVID recession. So, again, our whole pitch is that normal cyclical forces will work going forward, and we're actually in the worst of it right now and will be in a much better place in the second half of next year. It was interesting. Mike Wilson, your colleague in the U.S., talk a little bit more about, you know, even if inflation comes down the U.S., earnings wise, a margin erosion is still something that we'll look out for because demand picture is not looking too good now. And you're still seeing a lot of companies inability to kind of pass on those costs. Are you seeing any of that in Asia, Jonathan? Are we likely to see margins improve in any way? Well, the U.S. is, it's some extent, the inverse of the situation here. Its economy is still until very recently been strong. In some segments, it is clearly slowing, i.e. semi-intact in the third quarter. But the dollar strength is the clear inverse of currency weakness in Asia. And so that important point of differentiation is why we are actually upgrading here, whilst Mike remains cautious on the outlook for the S&P. And that kind of dynamic has happened before, as I mentioned earlier on your segment, you know, four out of ten prior bear markets, Asia and E.M. have troughed before the S&P 500. But with the additional kicker of just how extreme the dollar behavior is, there's an even greater chance that when we actually get the numbers as we go through next year, are stocks in Asia, semi-intact hardware are actually posting some pretty good numbers off the basis we have in the third and fourth quarter this year? Jonathan, thanks for joining us. We have one last question or M-life polls question that we've been asking all of our guests. Where is the next recession? Where do you see the signs of a recession? I know, Morgan Stanley has a kind of different take on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1339,2022-10-10 01:42:18
13114," Paul's question that we've been asking all of our guests is where is the next recession? Where do you see the signs of a recession? I know, you know, Morgan Stanley has a kind of different take on the whole recession call right now. Okay, let me be very clear about this. The Chinese economy has been in a recession for some considerable time. You can see that in particular in the way that unemployment has risen. Europe is going into a recession in aggregate. And some parts of the US economy have moved into recession, particularly in the SEMS and tech space. So this debate, some extent, is over. We are in some kind of global recession as of the third quarter. The question is how do we get out of it through the course of next year, and that gets to obviously the debate about the Fed. But also the kind of actions that a myriad of corporates will take in terms of reshaping their businesses, which cause the business cycle in the first place. So yeah, the debate about are we going into recession or not is over. Something that we see indicates that we're in some kind of recessionary environment as of the third quarter. And we'll get a lot more of that as companies announce over the next couple of weeks. All right, we're already there. All right, Jonathan. Thank you, so much for joining us this morning from Morgan Stanley, Asian, EMS, Stratus. They're joining from Singapore. It's got the Vani Quinn. She's in New York with your first word news. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Vani, thank you. China has criticized the expanded US restrictions on its access to semiconductor technology. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Maoning called them unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of US companies. She believes they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. Recent US measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry in advance its military capabilities. China is praising Elon Musk's proposal for a Hong Kong-like unification system for Taiwan. In the Financial Times profile, Musk says he would support a special administrative zone for Taiwan. On Twitter, China's ambassador to the US thanked Musk, saying the one country, two systems framework was key. Taiwan's president, saying when we'll pledge on Monday to strengthen the island's economy and deepen ties with Democratic allies in a national day speech. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan. North Korea has a country of threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks. French President Emmanuel Macron's urge citizens not to panic and act responsibly after shortages caused by a refinery strike left gas stations in some regions completely drained. The transport minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the type market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries, affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and Al-Number, a quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Bonnie Quinn. This is Bloomberg. Yvonne. All right. Take a look at your benchmarks here in Greater China with that reopening in mind here, not looking too good. In fact, we're seeing the CSI 300 set for the lowest since we have seen this April 2020. So, Sharers getting about that daily decline, about 6.1 percent. MSI had China. I see more deeper losses, Hong Kong as well, H.O.S. check, lower by some 3 percent coming up. We're going to do a deeper dive into the slump in China's holiday spending during golden week as St. COVID rules weigh in the population. I have the crucial party Congress. We have more analysis coming up. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1340,2022-10-10 01:46:34
13115," let us onدي dance recomendmaker the after what has been a golden week holiday, week long holiday there in greater China. You continue to see the CSI 300 and some pressure as well, hangs saying, though, that's where we're seeing a lot of the pain here on this Monday morning. Here's something that's gonna wake you up. You're gonna need some coffee for the rest of the week given just all the event risk at tapping. We have the party congress just about six days away as well. And there has been some weak data as well. That's hygiene, PMI services number that came out of the weekend in contraction once again. And you're taking a look at, at least when it comes to the currency, we are seeing some strength here, 712-06 for your offshore rate right now. So let's bring in our panel to really talk a little bit more about the numbers that we saw when it comes to golden week. And also, of course, what to look at, if it's spec'd in this party congress, joining us now is our chief, and these are correspondent Steven Engel and our Bloomberg economics chief economist. Steve, I'll start with you. Yeah, this wasn't very golden, this golden week. Yeah, that's right. We head into the party congress, which starts on Sunday with some economic headwinds. Perhaps political tailwinds, obviously, as Xi Jinping will most likely secure that president's defying third consecutive term, as they got rid of the term limits for the top man, as well as potentially the age retirement age limit. So that political agenda for Xi Jinping will probably include some of him, his successes, trumpeting the successes of COVID-0, even though there are signs that the society across China is starting to get really weary about these lockdowns and the ongoing COVID-0 policies or static management as they call it in China. But what's happening this week is the plenum, and essentially they are getting their ducks in a row ahead of the party congress, which is China's closest thing if you want to call it that an election, where the new leadership teams will be picked. Obviously with Xi Jinping at the top of that pyramid, but the plenum is essentially fine-tuning the policy, changes or policy points that Xi Jinping will deliver on Sunday, including any constitutional amendments and policy priorities that will be legalized and formalized at the National People's Congress in the upcoming march. David, you're taking on the numbers that we got. High-frequency data, or even just the official data we got when it comes to just air ticket sales, cinema box sales, tourism revenue, down some 26%. Yeah, what I'm going to say is that the data says definitely released a slag is trying for the consumption with the consumption data in the holiday. So yeah, I see your sign, everything was done. And especially in the travel-related spending is by the household. And obviously people were avoiding long-distance trip because of the concern over the possible constraints by the COVID-19 and that is what we saw in the market in the holiday. And when it comes to the Beijing PMI numbers that we got over the weekend, we're back in contraction. What did you see or some of the biggest drags that we saw? Yeah, definitely for Beijing because that was a major-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1341,2022-10-10 01:51:27
13116," weekend, we're back in contraction. What did you see as some of the biggest drags that we saw? Yeah, definitely for Chinese, because that was mainly the small business and the full service sector. That was the part that impacted the heaviest in China's economy. So that was not a surprise to me because everyone knows that the economy, particularly in the sub-execter, things like that. Steve, you know what it comes to the party Congress? You're starting to see some science we're talking about the Beijing Mirathons coming back. Xi Jinping was seen not wearing a mask because some of these national data all- Good, latching onto science. I know, right? Teleaves, are they going to relax COVID-0? From my vantage point, obviously, I'm not in China right now. Well, I am in China. I'm in Hong Kong. But I'm not on the mainland, so I can't necessarily give that direct anecdotal evidence. But I have not necessarily seen any major signs that they're going to relax all of a sudden COVID-0. If anything, they're increasing some of the restrictions. As reflected that we saw in the PMI, the services PMI with the lockdowns in September in Chengdu, in Lasa, in Dalian, other major cities. Right now, if you're the head, a Communist Party boss, in a major municipality or province in China, the last thing you want to do is have an outbreak. Allow an outbreak ahead of the Party Congress. So I think there's going to be tightening before there's any relaxation and any relaxation might not happen, might not be actually institutionalized, legalized, legislated until the National People's Congress, the annual session of Parliament in March. David, what are you looking out for on the Sunday then? In particular, when it comes to economic policies, what is most pressing to you? Well, can I say nothing? Because actually, yeah, actually, over the weekend, what we caught the last week called our eyes was the policies for the ReISD sector. But in our mind, that was just some technical adjustment in the markets, in the policy side. That was far from enough to boost the reboost of the housing market. So that I think people, I don't tie a lot of hope to that. And for the other policies, we are still watching to see what kind of policies can boost the consumption again. But to be honest, we think that the hurdle is the concern over the various containment measures. So that anything you want to do, you must overcome the hurdle, firstly. So that is why I say, no, I'm not so kind of encouraged. So we are still looking for some good news, really good news, but just as Steve has said, we don't have any clues on that. David, we'll have more. I'm sure for the full week here, as we can't have the party conference, David, true from the Uber economics also want to thank Steve and Ingle, our chief, no, these are correspondents. We got plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg. Next week, Bloomberg has the biggest names.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1342,2022-10-10 01:54:59
13117," Next week Bloomberg has the biggest names in business. First, from the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut, a global perspective on alternative investments with influencers from politics and finance. Then, Bloomberg Invest, New York, where industry leaders discuss the challenges and opportunities in today's changing economic landscape. Coverage begins October 11th, only on Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. With the Federal Reserve's inflation mandate, inflation is much too high, understanding where energy prices are going, where food prices are going, where commodity prices are going. And it's important to us as it is to all Americans. All right, you heard there, you know, Cash Car, the Minneapolis Fed President, also the U.S. former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Sumbers. Speaking there, when it comes to the Fed's inflation fight, it seems like that resolve very much still there. You're feeling that pain across these markets here this morning, the back of that strong job support that we got in the U.S. on Friday. You have inflation numbers coming out this week out of the U.S. as well. You have the whole geopolitics side of thing with this U.S. chip restriction, so you are seeing the likes of Huahong-Semi, wow, down some 8.9 percent. We're watching, of course, this unverified list the U.S. came out with with a list of some more companies as well, very much in focus. So, yeah, there's a lot on the plate there. The data hasn't looked good when it comes to gold a week, or a week away from the party Congress. So, there's a lot of event risks out there. U.S. futures are still in the red here this morning. So, be it the moves that we're seeing, not as bad, U.S. markets are closed as well, along with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia here today. So, we're not seeing volumes or in particular a little bit low across the region here very closely. But, yeah, let's go to Vanyu Quinn in New York for a quick check of your latest business flash headlines. Hey, Vanyu. Hey, Yvonne, thank you. Japanese printer makers, Seiko Epsom, may raise prices because of the chronic supply chain up heevil that's disrupted the electronics firms around the world. In an exclusive interview, the president told Bloomberg that demand for printers and work from home products, Acero Boston, that the company is doing its best to mitigate production costs. And Chinese who deliver giant Maytuana said to be considering expanding into Hong Kong, this as domestic growth slows. Those are your latest Bloomberg business flash headlines, Yvonne. All right, Vanyu. Thanks so much for that update here as well. We're continuing to watch these markets. We're going to give you a brief update coming up. This is Bloomberg. It's one of the qualities, I guess, that you found in your mentors. A motivates you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1343,2022-10-10 01:59:40
13118," We can come from men and it's one of the qualities I guess that you found in your mentors that also pushed you up. Do we need even more nurturing post pandemic? Is the way that we talk with employees going to change? I think talent becomes the single biggest differentiator of a successful entity versus the most successful entity. So you've got to do everything possible to hire, train, retain, put your arms around talent. You really got to focus on your talent. In the past it's always been given money. You know, show them that they have upward mobility and can make even more money and that's the only reason people come to work. I think post pandemic, we're seeing more and more people say I have to worry about me as a person, I have to worry about my family, I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health. So we've got to start encompassing people as holistic humans as opposed to the tool of the train, which means that we have to engage with our head, heart and hands. It's not just head and hands, the heart has been engaged. So we have to be sure more empathy, show that we care that they're citizens of the community, your members of the family, and all of those have to come into consideration as we help an executive or an employee. Be an employee and be a post to the community and the family. The stakes are higher. Is it possible the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply? I mean that has happened before. We've looked at this very carefully and the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life family isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but you know, and COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year. The semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are a trillion dollars, a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates. It's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Yeah, almost 10 am here in Hong Kong and in Singapore 11 o'clock in the morning in Tokyo. This is Blue Moon Market. It's CyberShots. It's CyberShots with the event. Our top source is this morning, Hong Kong mainland markets falling after not so golden week holiday that saw tourists revenue tumble with COVID shadow, looming large semiconductor socks under pressure as well as Beijing warns fresh US curves and access to chip tech, threatened the industry and global growth. And all cons as China's top leaders hold their final gathering before the crucial Communist Party Congress that is set to hand Xi Jinping a third term as president. Okay, so how do we go? We've got a lot of pressure at the moment. Of course, as I follow through from the was a better than expected to read out of those non-phom payroll numbers, but I can certainly say that it was a case of gain of there being good news, meaning bad news. We've got more and more surety that we're going to get a mega rate height coming out of the federal reserve. Of course, this is all playing out here on the bond market also looking at the currencies and certainly the moment we could see the R&B opening up. And of course, it's the first day back. Is it not even after that five day work? Why day long golden week holiday in China? And what are we seeing actually here as we play catch up? Well, there's a lot, right? We were all thought that these different proxies that we saw last way. Everything was in the green that maybe we could see the Asia market come back with a boost. Over the weekend, we got some pretty bad numbers when it comes to the chai-ching PMI services.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1344,2022-10-10 02:03:42
13119," these different proxies that we saw last week, everything was in the green that maybe we could see the Asia market come back with a boost. But over the weekend, we got some pretty bad numbers when it comes to the Chinese PMI services, first contraction we've seen since May. You talk about the tourism revenue that we saw out of people just traveling in around China. That went down about a quarter. And then you have the whole geopolitics side of things with DC giving these sort of chip curbs to a lot of these companies that maybe operate in China or export to China. So the tech space, HISTEC is lower by about 3% here this morning. The CSI 300 we're heading back to about those lows that we've seen from a few months ago. And the event risk doesn't really end the quite there, Rich, right? We got the jobs report from the US on Friday. But we also have inflation numbers this week as well. Could really kind of keep things, I mean, the volatility going. Yeah, arguably, this is much more important than the job is number in many senses. Yes, you probably expected the year on year. We're looking at what 8.1% here. We're looking at also the core number. The core about 6.5% with regards to that. But don't forget also, it is a big week in DC as well. IMF and World Bank meetings taking place. And we've got to be OK, Fed Minutes and more, right? Yeah. And a lot of inflation numbers, not just out of the US, India, China, Singapore GDP, the wrap of the week. The Fed Minutes could be pretty interesting as well. Just, you know, are we going to see any more signs of maybe this result from the Federal Reserve here, that pivot that we were hoping for last week seems to be squashed right now here. Let's bring an M-Line strategy as Mark Cranfield on, you know, where the market is going to go from here, Mark? What's your latest here? And what are you watching out for the most this week? Obviously, the focus is very much towards the Fed and then how many more jumbo hikes do they have in store? I mean, people before Friday's payrolls numbers, they may have been thinking that the Fed would be content to push rates up to 4.5% early next year, but it looks as though we're going to reach that by the end of this year. And we may soon have people saying that 5% is needed as the ceiling for US rates before there's any chance of them taking a pause. There's certainly nothing to suggest that the Fed is anywhere close to reducing rates again. So as you've seen, some people on Bloomberg writing, like Muhammad Aliere, saying that the Fed is bringing closer to the risk of recession now, because they could go too far, too fast, be aggressive with too many big hikes. And then slow down the economy rather quicker than they really hoped for. So a soft landing now seems to be a pretty difficult thing to achieve in the US when you've got the employment situation much stronger than people were expecting. And the need for interest rates to go much higher. So this week's CPI report may show a slight softening in the numbers, but it's certainly not going to be enough to diswade the Fed that they're going to be hiking by big numbers in November. Yeah, but the thing is, how does this power of the currency market? Does it give the dollar more impetus? And do you know what about the yen with the being holiday? I think it's a sports day. Yeah, it looks as though some people are taking advantage of the Tokyo holiday to push dollar yen around quite a bit. We've seen it go up and come right back down in a pretty short space of time. We probably can't read too much into that. But as you mentioned earlier, it is the week of the IMF and World Bank meetings. And there are several countries around the world who've already said that the dollar is too strong for them. We've seen a few in Asia, Taiwan, Korea, have all mentioned that. There certainly could come up on the agenda for people meeting in Washington this week. They may try to pressurize the US authorities into some sort of measure to say that the dollar is too strong or it's become strong enough. There hasn't been any sign that US treasure is willing to do that so far. But this is a big week. And there are several countries Japan, maybe one of them as well, who go to the US and say, look, you're getting pretty uncomfortable. We don't want to risk of a repeat of the Asian financial crisis we saw in the 1990s. So maybe it's time to do something about it. Traders will be watching for any chink in the armour that there is going to be some sort of co-ordinated intervention. Hasn't been on the cards so far. But then again, in the past, it has come completely out of the blue. So it could be a big week for foreign exchange markets. Mark, when it comes to Chinese markets coming back online, what struck you the most in just the pain that we're seeing right now in China? I'm obviously as you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1345,2022-10-10 02:08:48
13120," When it comes to Chinese markets coming back online, what struck you the most and just the pain that we're seeing right now in China? Obviously as you were saying earlier, the high frequency data during the holiday is not helpful But if you want to look for one single thing that traders are focused on when we saw the The media reports coming out from China today They were still Resolutely defending the COVID-zero policy traders want to see it gone They want it they could only get really optimistic on China equities when they know That COVID-zero has been put to bed and that China is reopening until that happens It's going to be very difficult for China equities to get serious long-term investors back on board That is the biggest headwind and traders want to get rid of it Mark good sir. Thank you very much indeed Mark ran for you that M life status and you know we had golden week of course and this market reopening and a bit of a That's quick in either direction really isn't it? I mean we're seeing a little bit of a perhaps a little bit of pressure But let's say it kind of makes sense of it all and bring in our Asia equities reporter here Charlotte Yang is with us and Charlotte We're leading up to the Congress that's for certain and that's perhaps the fundamental thing on people's minds Yes, so traders returning from holiday. This is definitely not the idea session to open with and given that the big meetings happening just this Sound day. So for today's market, you know the global South on Friday even though China's less affected by fat It's still I'm tracking on some of the sentiment on shore as well as you mentioned the weak consumption data coming out from the golden week As well as properties acting and that things really you know improving as well as COVID-zero all of this is just tracking I'm going to new outbreak as well You know exactly. Yeah, and also the latest news was cheap and from the US as showing that we are still on the high tensions between China and US And yeah, so it's just I saw you coming on set you know it's so busy today What it comes to party Congress though? What are analysts? What are traders saying to you about what they're expecting? How are they repositioning or positioning around that? Yeah, so that's for the position Everyone's still very skeptical and wait and see but they're definitely watching for all kinds of cues and rumors coming out this week As we approach the big meeting so on the political side give that watching a gas in my very closely on how the composition You know for the key the highest leaders will be and as well as who will be the new Vice premier as that we indicate a lot about like how we're going to in terms of like non-apolices And then it's then it's like COVID or should we expect more similar policies coming Coming out of the big meeting absolutely, you know and as you mentioned It's going to be anything they say about softening the COVID lockdowns and that's going to be actually key because amount of people who have had in the program Who've said well if they just Got a real and didn't have these lockdowns. Well, we've been in different places entirely for the economy I agree in tally and everyone's saying that you know if there's a clear sign of COVID zero shifting then we could see China as like the biggest turnaround But and then like these it's really interesting how people are searching all kinds of cues like the Beijing marathon thing And that people think oh this might be a dick and something but then like you just mentioned then the we have we have another COVID lockdown. Yeah, so it's just a lot of conflicting signals. It's just mixing all around all right Charlotte It's gonna be busy week for you as well our Asia Equities reporter Charlotte Young joining us here on set Let's get to your first word news.

UK Prime Minister Liz Tross is planning to speak directly this week to mutinous MPs in her conservative party. Chancellor Kwasi Gwarteng was set to address a regular meeting of lawmakers on Wednesday, but Tross is now expected to replace him. A poorly received tax-cut package and a fractious annual conference have Tross fighting to regain control of her party just a month into her tenure. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg, quick take powered by more than 2700 journalists and more than 120 countries. I'm Vani Quinn, this is Bloomberg. Rich. All right, so still the camera at the emblem of the market. So we're looking at Malaysia's 2023 budget announcement and what it means to the country's markets are going to develop with may bank investment banking. But first we're going to count down to the China Party Congress out of a golden week that saw COVID-zero way on activity. We have more on the economic outlook with Paychen Liu of NatWest markets. This is Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance.

This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg. The lineup. This October delegates will meet for the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.

Keep it tuned to Bloomberg for the up to the minute coverage and expert analysis you need. Coverage begins October 16th with special Sunday programming on Bloomberg, your global business authority. Here we go. Let's just check in on these Chinese markets. The tech side of things are gaining a disservice to the broader market here as well. Hangs down 2.3% and look at Shanghai just off by about 2.10. So we do have China's tourism figures as well. Revenue, I think, was down 26% during this National Day holiday? Yeah, you take everything from air ticket sales, box office sales. I think it just looked weak across the board here. It's probably the reason why we're seeing such a sell off here when it comes to some of these mainland markets as we reopen there. Let's bring in Patreon.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1347,2022-10-10 02:16:36
13122," It just look weak across the board here. It's prior to the reason why we're seeing such a sell-off here when it comes to some of these mainland markets as we reopen. There, let's bring in Paycheon, Leo, China, economists at net-west markets. You know, the goal main number is certainly not as golden as we thought. I'm just wondering your take on them and how has this way on the outlook of China now? Thanks for having me today. Clear the data on holiday tourism, alongside the services of PMIWISO, the weekend, are showing that China is still struggling to see any sustainable, strong recovery with the COVID policies in place. In fact, COVID policies are on site with progesterator, pressure are the two biggest risks China's short-term growth currently. So, I mean, are you seeing any signs of improvement when you look at the data overall here, Paycheon? Well, we look at services and consumption sector recovery they are really in sync with the COVID policies in place throughout the year. Whenever COVID policies saw signs of easing, these indicators will be coming back stronger, otherwise it's just going to still struggle with a sustainable recovery. So that means as long as we could see COVID easing in coming quarters, there is hope that the service sector and consumption sector recovery will come back. But until then, we're still going to see them struggling. On the other hand, on the X-Box sector, a manufacturing sector, those sectors are seeing a gradual slowdown from the peak of recovery Q2. I guess what you mentioned, COVID-0 basically is what's dominating the narrative of the consumption story. If that goes away, does everything just turn aggressively higher? Or do you think that it's still going to be a very slow and gradual recovery in consumption? COVID policies are really wild cards. So I think it's very hot for us to conclusively say if you're going to see a sudden turnaround or a gradual comeback, it really depends on how the COVID-19 exit strategy will play out. Our ways of assumption is that we probably are going to hear some communications over the COVID-19 exit strategy after the party on risk. But most likely, the easing of COVID policies is going to be very gradual and it's going to happen throughout the 23-mile period. All right, Richard, when you look at the markets themselves right now and what they are actually telling us, are they really the moment of baking in all the problems that we have right now? And what would it take now for there to be a move at a pivot, if you will, to the upside and get the bulls out of their pens? Well, I think we need to see a few bottom lines being established on the slowing down before we see more optimism in the markets. First and foremost, the prology sector is still struggling because China is still pressing ahead with the leveraging policies. The three guidelines on prology sectors, developers are not lifted and the purchase controls and minister controls for the buyers are also not lifted in some bigger cities. So until we're going to see any policy intention to establish a bottom line to prevent any further purchase extra weakness, we're still going to see them struggling as well. On the other hand, we are also looking for more explanations from the party congress on the official balances between the quality of growth as well as the growth rates to see where the balance pivot towards. If there is a pivot towards the growth rates, then we might see more policy stimulus coming from the officials. Otherwise, I think they're still going to press ahead with reforms and that's going to be exchanged with short-term pain for the long-term gains. What else are you looking for in terms of maybe just the political lineup, right? And what is I going to tell us about policy moving forward? Well, I think for the upcoming party congress, President Xi is widely expected to remain in power for at least the next five years. So the focus then will be on the lineup of the Politburo Standing Committee for the dynamics of policy changes. And that goes to handing hand with the party.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1348,2022-10-10 02:21:16
13123," So the focus then will be on the lineup of the Politburo standing committee for the dynamics of policy changes. And that goes hand in hand with the policy priority for the next five years. We're also going to scrutinize the political work report to see what are the authorities focused for the next five, five years to one decade. Page, I know. Thanks so much from that West markets there. We have some white pictures that are happening in Taiwan right now. Tomas National Day celebrations are underway here, which does include a military parade. We're expected to hear from the president, saying, when set to speak later on, we got plenty more ahead. This is Wilbur.. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We're having a look at these talks surrounding Britain's accession to the CPTPP. I got that right. It's continued over the weekend, Canada's trade, international trade minister Merriam. So, as the UK's bid to join one of Asia's big trade banks, we'll take a bit longer. This is the first session request. We've always said to CPTPP partners that the high quality of this agreement, the gold standard agreement that CPTPP is, we encourage any aspiring economy wishing to join to meet those high standards and that they would be welcomed. So, we are very much working with the United States, rather the United Kingdom, on this agreement and on their session. What Japan is the chair for the UK accession process, so they are taking a really leadership role here as part of the CPTPP partners. But our first session, so we are absolutely working with the United Kingdom on this. What about the issues when it comes to China and Taiwan potentially their involvement? Well, we've always said that this agreement is a high standard agreement. We welcome those wishing to join to meet those high standards. But this is also the first session. And the first session is with the United Kingdom. We as the CPTPP partners want to get it right. And so we're taking our time to make sure we do get it right through this first session with the UK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1349,2022-10-10 02:24:58
13124," as the CPTPP partners want to get it right. And so we're taking our time to make sure we do get it right through this first session with the UK. There's a big push into Southeast Asia, including one of the EU Singapore as the trading hub. Why the focus on this region? Where do you see, I guess, the benefits for all of the parties involved? And particularly where do you see the growth opportunities for Canada within Southeast Asia? Well, a terrific question. I mean, that's Canada's trade minister, but also the small business minister. And the mandate that I have from my prime minister and our government's commitment is to diversify and grow opportunities for market access around the world. I mean, Canada is the only G7 country that has a free trade agreement with every other country. This region is dynamic. It is growing. We already have the CPTPP. We are at the negotiating table with the ASEAN countries, as well as bilateral negotiations with Indonesia, which is where I'm heading to later this afternoon. So making sure that we diversify and grow into this market and into this region is extremely important. Canada is a trading country. Two-thirds of our economy is dependent on trade. One out of six jobs is related to trade. So as a trading country, creating opportunities into this region is important. I announced a Canadian trade gateway anchored here in Singapore. And the way that will work is that I want people to see this as Canada's front door to the region. But the door swings both ways. So I want to see the region having a place to learn more about Canada. Where to invest in Canada, how we can collaborate together so that the trade really is both ways benefiting the region, but also Canada. A slightly different topic, but I'm wondering about progress made with the U.S. to bring it into the minimum corporate tax in line with the OEC agreement, a 15 percent. I know that's important to Canada as well. How's that going? We are working very hard and very focused on this important multilateral agreement through the OECD, of which the U.S. is part of. So we're at the table and we are working hard and very, and hoping that what we will get at is a conclusion of this multilateral agreement reached with the OECD partners, including the U.S. Minister, I'm wondering how important a multilateral approach is in Asia with Canada and some of its partners, including the likes of Korea, that this multi-pronged strategy is also to counter China's weight across the region. Is that very significant in terms of avoiding a situation where you see multiple trading partners being pitted against each other? Well, for Canada, it is really important that we continue to diversify and to provide opportunities for our exporters and for our businesses. We often talk in Canada about having creating an economy that works for all, as the small business minister, but also Canada's trade minister, helping businesses, whether they're women entrepreneurs, indigenous owned businesses, small and medium-sized enterprises, take the benefits of trade and to make sure that workers get the benefit of the trade means diversifying and looking into markets that are high growth markets. We're talking about opportunities in the digital economy. We are increasingly finding partners to grow the green economy, to diversify and create those, that growth in green growth in Canada, but doing so with partners in this region, whether it be Korea, whether it be Japan, whether it's here in Singapore, and with the many partners that are absolutely in the CPTPP, as I said, we've seen the growth in trade with our partners who are here, and we're looking to do more of that. Mary, there, Canadian Minister of International Trade, just take a look at when it comes to markets here today. It's a pretty tough Monday morning here, just on the back of that strong, newest jobs report. You have inflation data coming through here. In terms of movers, it's really the tourism, the travel sector we're watching out for in China, giving just those pretty depressing numbers that we got when it comes to tourism revenue, ticket sales alike here. So you already see the likes of leaning down some 8 percent this morning. Yeah, it's so big of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1350,2022-10-10 02:29:51
13125," Pretty depressing numbers that we got when it comes to tourism revenue, ticket sales, a like here So you already see the likes of leaning down some 8% Yeah, so we connect to stocks in China having an absolute beating as well There we go, I mean this is all down to US curbs on China's access to American technology, right? Let's tell you what we have coming up China is Expanding those chip access to chip technology by more details coming up So I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I've had. I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. All right, you can hear the music there. National day celebrations are underway in Taipei here this morning. We see markets are closed there as well. And yeah, we're excited to hear from the president's having one a little later on. Yeah, and looking at what's happening market wise. Of course, there's a national day holiday there in Taiwan. I also got Turkey going off its lunch break right now. No, it's actually on holiday, of course, because it's sports days and there we go. There's no trading today. Yeah, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, US, yeah, there's a lot. China's reopening though, that's certainly what we're seeing here. We're looking pretty bad when it comes to equities here this morning, come on, at least we're having a bit of more a scene where green here with some of the dollar weakness, I guess, you could say, but offshore Remembee, you actually are seeing some decent games here a bit of a catch up, I guess, when it comes to the onshore rate, we're hovering around 7, 11, 35 here that fixed today. We thought we could see maybe a pretty strong result of the PLEO C here leading up to the party Congress. It wasn't that strong that bias here today as well. I think it was about 300 pips or so. But you see New Zealand 10 year yields, 11 basis points here in the back what we've been seeing in the Treasury market as well, that US jobs report, you have inflation numbers coming out later on this week. I think when it comes to US 10 year yield, we have seen at least 11 straight weeks where yields have picked up. That's the longest stretch we've seen since the 80s. OK, well, that might not go the follow through from that jobs report on Friday. OK, let's get you to the first word news. Bunny Quinn is in New York. Rich, thank you. China is being hit by a rebound in COVID-19 cases following the Golden Week holidays.

China is praising Elon Musk's proposal for a Hong Kong-like unification system for Taiwan. In a financial time's profile, Musk says he would support a special administrative zone for Taiwan. On Twitter, China's ambassador to the US thanked Musk, saying the one country two systems framework was key. Taiwan's president, Zai Ing-wen, will pledge on Monday to strengthen the island's economy and deepen ties with Democratic allies in a national day speech. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles Sunday, adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and to act responsibly after shortages caused by a refinery strike left gas stations in some regions completely drained. The transport minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries, affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Global news, 24 hours a day on air and Al-Munibir a quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. I'm Vani Kwin, this is Bloomberg. Rich. Okay, we're having a look at China as it criticizes the latest US moves to expand restrictions on its access to semi-conductive technology, as you're saying the alarm supply chains and ultimately the global economy, Asia Tech Editor Edwin Chian joins us now. Edwin, what's the deal here exactly? I think what we're seeing is some of the most sweeping curves against China that the US has unveiled in years. I think that the counter things that goes well beyond what the Trump administration did, with the way it sanctioned Huawei and other Chinese companies, I think taking together these broad restrictions threaten to stifle China's ambitions to build a global semi-conductive industry, and they're also far-reaching implications for global chip firms, for instance, and video and the memory chip makers such as Samsung and Hynix. But it's all very complicated and it takes a while to parse exactly what's happening here. Yeah, obviously, maybe talk about how far-reaching some of these curves are. I mean, does it have to be someone, the Chinese companies that are going to be the most seeing the most pain from all this, or maybe even for Asia Tech companies as well, if you have China operations, are they also impacted from this? Yes, I think broadly speaking, the three areas that the industry has focused on as in service to the restrictions we're unveiled. One is simply a ban on AI and kind of high-performance computing chips, and then related to that, a ban on equipment that can make such high-performance computing chips. And then finally, we have what we call an unverified list, which is sort of a pre-curse to the entity list that, while we kind of make famous, it's the best-known company on the entity's list. The unverified list is essentially a step on to join the entity list, and what happened was Washington gave itself pretty broad powers we think to add companies to that list and migrate them to the entity list shortly after. Edwin, the stuff. Thank you, Asia Tech editor Edwin, Chandler. I'm going to get you back to Taipei. We've got Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen pledging there a moment to strengthen the islands. The economy is apparently going to be talking about deepening ties with Democratic allies. We're looking also at this all happening against this background of the risk of a global recession, and of course we've had these unprecedented military drills by China here too, Edwin. Yeah, and of course everyone's looking to see what",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1352,2022-10-10 02:38:33
13127," Drills by China hit two of them. Yeah, and of course, everyone's looking to see what she might say, leading up to, of course, with the party Congress in Beijing over this weekend as well. Her stance on when it comes to China policy. Obviously, we have seen kind of this revolving door of U.S. lawmakers that have made their way to Taiwan in the last few weeks or so. So we'll see it. We'll bring you the latest term once we do hear more from the president here this morning on those national day celebrations. Okay, let's get to the Korean Peninsula. We've got the South there saying that it's military will strengthen security cooperation with the United States and Japan, including the deployment of what it calls U.S. strategic assets. Of course, this is against North Korea firing two short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday, Brendan Scott, Lee Blumberg's North Asia government coverage, and joins us for more tensions are high. And certainly the moment we've got these military drills in prospect as well. So it gives a sense of what we have going on on the ground now, Brendan, between Washington and Seoul and how they square up to Pyongyang because Beijing has been deaf and deafening with its silence. Oh, yeah, everybody was wondering what Kim Jong-un was up to these last few weeks. This unprecedented barrage of missile tests, including intermediate-range ballistic missile fired over Japan. The first time that's happened in five years. And all the while, Kim Jong-un had been silent and had not appeared in public for about a month. What we know now, thanks to a series of reports from the North Korean state news agency this morning is that Kim Jong-un was overseeing all of these tests, participating on the ground as a commander in chief as he has been known to do over the years, and that he is characterizing them all as a warning to the U.S. over their recent military drills in the Sea of Japan and elsewhere around the region. He said this in the mind of a lot of experts is pointing the stage to some sort of low yield nuclear test in the coming weeks. They've been expecting – he hasn't set off an atomic bomb for about five years as well. And so that's the next milestone we're expecting. Of course, this comes across against the backdrop of nuclear saber rattling over the Ukraine war on the other side of the Eurasian continent. So it's really sivating to this sense of tension globally right now between the West and Russia and China and their allies. What are we expecting from the response from the West, particularly when it comes to U.S. Japan and Korea as well as they've sort of been kind of joining ties here and trying to offset this in some way? Well, we've seen an increase recently in and around Korea with drills between the U.S., South Korea and Japan. Also, they're trying to give the drills that they normally do a bit more visibility so that they can present the United Front against North Korea. It does seem like we're back into sort of an old escalatory cycle here with North Korea where we're going to see both sides signaling to each other in a tip-for-tatt way. So I don't think we've seen the end yet of tests from one side or the – an exercises from the other. Brendan, thank you so much for that update. Brendan Scott there from Singapore, who leads our government coverage here in Asia, coming up. May Bank Investment Banking joins us to review Malaysia's 2023 budget announcement and what it means for markets. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1353,2022-10-10 02:42:58
13128," Let's go my favorite commenting! No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources. From more than 120 countries. The moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. The global economy has unveiled a smaller budget for 2023 seeking to narrow the government's funding shortfall, even while lowering tax rates in the run-up to elections. Spending will total $80 billion that's down 3% on the estimate for this year. We've got Anand Pathmar, a content joining us now. He's had a regional equity research at Maybank investment, Banking Group. What do you expect out of this budget? It does sound a bit like Britain here funding shortfall and then tax cuts on top of it. I guess for you putting in context, we are expecting general elections to be announced in the next few days, if not weeks. It's perhaps understandable that a budget would be a bit of a giveaway budget. It was a record expenditure for 2023, but we aren't having $2 billion. We had a lot of giveaways for low-income households. There was a 10 billion in cash transfers by itself. Also tax cuts for the middle income, as you mentioned. Also for the civil servants, which is a major voting block for the government. We had quite a lot of salary increases and increments as well. So really, not so surprising that in terms of fiscal property, perhaps a bit deferred to the next budget perhaps. Do you think it moves the needle in any way when it comes to the economic recovery for the country? Yeah, I think the focus very much right now is to cement the economic recovery we are seeing here today. So the economy is on track for 67% GDP growth this year. And I think the government really wants to see that in the bag given the rising external headwinds. So in terms of fiscal targets, I think we are being okay, I guess, to defer a few of the more pressing spending issues. So for the fiscal deficit, we were expecting a target of about 5% for 2023, but actually it's now 5.5%. So a bit more of a buffer for the government to work with in terms of stimulating the economy. So it really depends. For the next budget, we'll see a dramatic pullback once we have passed elections, once we can talk about more sensitive issues like removing subsidies and introducing more taxes, that we will see a more aggressive fiscal deficit target. What is the actual read through if there is any here for equities, I guess, because I mean the KLCI is down what about the 11% of the year to date are there about, Sun-Un? Yeah, I think for equities, it's really a side relief compared to budget 2022 or last year's budget, you know, when we had this one-off prosperity tax, there were no such levies in this budget targeted at the corporates. So I think that's a major plus. I think the government's also, while we didn't see it in this budget, the promise of future fiscal discipline was also quite welcomed by the conference sector because that reduces the risk premium of the government keeping coming back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1354,2022-10-10 02:47:24
13129," future fiscal discipline was also quite welcome by the corporate sector because that reduces the risk premium of the government keeping coming back to the corporate sector for money whenever it needs it to plug fiscal gaps. So overall I would say it was a mildly positive bias in terms of equity market re-through. Where in the consumer sector do you think this could benefit the most? What are the clear winners do you think? Do you look at tourism, for example? What are some of the key things that you're watching out for? Sure, I mean there were a lot of incentives and tax, you know, so giveaways for a variety of businesses. So I think a lot of them were very incremental and long-term in nature but certain sectors like consumer tourism as you pointed out as well. Also renewables, EVs, they're also quite significant tax incentives being given to some speedup recovery. In the case of EVs adoption as well. Coming back to the consumer sector, as I mentioned before we had significant cash transfers to various segments in a middle class, civil servants, low income. So that's really going to be quite stimulative for that sector. So we think we have a couple of picks or preferences there but mostly in the consumer staples and consumer discretionary space as well, like the DIY, which I have foods which has the Starbucks franchise. Also farm fresh would be some names that we would be recommending. Let's put your regional hat on now and it gives a sense of what you like and what you don't. Yeah, I think Asian is a whole, thus far a bit a little bit like Malaysia. We have seen quite a strong recovery in the underlying economies, you know, post the end of lockdowns and the opening up of borders. And we think that tailwind will continue at least into the fourth quarter of this year. But beyond that, you know, interest rate increases will start to impact, you know, the major slowdown we're seeing in developed markets will start to impact as well, especially the more trade oriented economies like Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. So I think going into 2023, we're probably more biased in favor of the larger sort of domestic demand-driven economies, which can which are more insulator from external headwinds. I think one good one is Indonesia, you know, I think that's an economy that has a huge domestic market, seeing a lot of inflows on the FDI side as well from supply chain relocation. And also the government's own push to encourage investment in industries related to things like EVs. Also, Vietnam is another country or market that we really like at this point. The market that is down almost 30% year to day. There's been a lot of retail panic because of all the macro volatility. But we see huge opportunities in domestic market again. A lot of FDI inflows and the market is trading at 10 times the E, which we think is extremely attractive. Should I expect more pain for EM, Asia or ASEAN currencies as well? Do you think we've reached, you know, the floor for some of these currencies? Is it time to continue to hedge what's your take? I think given that we still don't expect dramatic interest rate increases across Asia. We are seeing them in all countries. I mean, Vietnam made a big move a week ago with 100 basis points increase. They're still very much lagging the 300 basis points we've seen year to date for the US. So I think from that perspective, we will see some pressure continuing for emerging market currencies. ASEAN currencies as well. I think the overall sort of sense or a risk of a version on investors' part as well. We'll see some version from holding emerging market currencies. But beyond that, the reality is that ASEAN markets have been outperforming year to date despite the currency weakness. I can just look at the indices. And I think the underlying economic, some of the attractions of the region in terms of GDP recovery, so very low-beta stock markets will continue to hold water and we'll see continued out performance into the early part of next year. Anand, thank you so much for joining us, especially as it is the public holiday there for E. Thank you so much. Anand Patma Kampthan joining us there for Maybank Investment Banking Group. There we go. That is the President of Taiwan speaking just to been talking about the chip industry in the country, talking about the need to bolster leadership in semiconductors, ensuring critical chip facilities safety too. Right, there's a lot of commentary about this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1355,2022-10-10 02:51:43
13130," to bolster leadership in semiconductors and ensuring critical commentary about this whole chips curbs that we heard from the US. If you took a look at the biggest one, it's Korea and it's Taiwan. There's a lot of questions about what these curbs mean for some of these companies. She's probably speaking a bit more about that as well. She's been talking a little bit more about Taiwan has to prepare all times amid rising tension. China military actions affect Indo-Pacific stability. So we're looking at more science of firms trying to stance here right now. Taiwan to take responsibility for defending itself. What would hope so? Anyway, there we go. If on. Right, okay. We're going to take a break. We're going to be back at the other side of it with a full market check. Thank you. When US jobs numbers are released, we're coming almost bang on. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. If you're looking for 263,000, you've won. An instant expert analysis. Participation coming down to you. Put it all together for us. This is a slight disappointment relative to hope. You can find anything if your hawkers are published in this work. It's going to keep the fit on track for a 75 basis point rule at the next meeting. This labor market is still pretty resilient. Nobody covers jobs today like Bloomberg, your global business authority. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears. Moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. Let's have a look at some of the latest business fashion headlines. We've got the Australian Lough Morris Blackburn filing a complaint against mobile phone operator Optus. It's claiming that the company failed to protect the personal information. If it's customers, last month the date of almost 10 million former and current Optus customers was hacked. Morris Blackburn says thousands of customers have already registered their details with the firm. The Australian Information Commissioner is set to be one of the largest ever. India's mint is reporting that Gotam Adani and his family are in early discussions with investors to raise at least $10 billion. The reports saying potential investors include to Masssec, GIC and other wealth and private equity funds. Mint saying that the capital would be used to fund the group's expansion plans and clean energy, ports as well as cement production. Chinese food delivery giant, to Michuan, is set to be considering expanding into Hong Kong and other international markets as domestic growth slows down our sources telling us that plans were at an early stage. Michuan is not yet responded to requests for clients. The company is now in the hands of the company. It's a big week for data, it's big week for earnings as well. Plenty of more volatility to come. I think about what the big names we're looking out for. We talked about TSMC. We have black rock fast retailing. That's all happening on Thursday as well Friday. We have a week. Let's have a look at what our Mlife Pulse survey was all about. Whether earnings would disappoint and push equities to new lows. This is a Mercedes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1356,2022-10-10 02:55:34
13131," Let's just have a look at what our Mlife Pulse Survey was all about when weather earnings would disappoint and push equities to new lows. And this is some of the respondents. Earnings expectations have fallen sharply for the third quarter. We believe that they're going to be better than expected. The official right now for the third quarter from faxat is a 2% gain with several sectors in the negative territory. We think that 2% is too low. As much as I hear people tell me the consumers in good shape, they're not in the US. The savings rates decade low, credit card use is decade highs. And it's definitely a deceleration. In the US is nothing that any of us like to write home about, so to speak. Nevertheless, the economy is on a more solid footing than most places. And earnings still look attractive. The next move will be a more realistic assessment of earnings by analysts. Going into the third quarter earnings season, if we have some positive surprises, the market's looking for good news. I think it will react. All right. Continue to watch his live pictures out of Taipei, the president there of Taiwan, speaking for the National Day celebrations. One pretty strong wording of what we're hearing here when it comes to Taiwan won't compromise on sovereignty and democracy. Taiwan will build asymmetrical warfare capabilities as well. And they will take responsibility for defending itself. So some pretty hawkish sort of wording from the president here and really kind of talking more about the defense side of things when it comes to Taiwan. Okay, well, as they would be talking about semis, let's have a look at what's going on, a tech-wise hearing home Kong. It's not looking great for technology, certainly. And if you look at what's happening, every stock is down apart from Kingsoft, of course, there. It is just margin high. It's just the only stock on it the way up. There's no news behind that, but they did fall earlier last week after seeing a substantial loss through the intercept numbers. So maybe it's just gone down too far at that stage. Yeah, BYD though. 10% loss is there. Watching some of these chip stocks here in the back of those chip curves that we heard from the US as well, that seems to be one of the biggest drags today. This is Bloomberg. So you build a successful company, but you might not want to run it for the next 10, 15, 20 years, or do you? And if you didn't, would you want to go into government, if the president called you to serve our country, would you go into government, or would you start another company? I love what I do. And I feel like I have this luxury with 23 me that it keeps evolving. We started out just as a start out consumer company. We're thick in research. We got into drug discovery in 2015, and now we're getting to the delivery of care. So I've been really lucky with 23 me that it's been endlessly interesting, and I'm surrounded by incredibly talented, brilliant individuals where I learn from them. And what I always advise people to do is you should take jobs where you're learning. And if you stop learning in a job, then you should quit. And frankly, when people leave 23 me, I say, if you're not...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1357,2022-10-10 03:00:12

And like, frankly, when people leave 23 me, like, I say, if you're not learning anymore, you should move on. So I'm 100% committed to 23 me. That said, my other passion is other direct to consumer. Like, I wanna build out a true consumer-empowered healthcare world, like one that is outside of the existing system. And I do, there's no greater force than government. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ It's impossible, the industries in an arms race that will lead to spending itself into an oversupply. I mean, that has happened before. You know, we've looked at this very carefully And the digitization of everything. Tell me what aspect of your life, Emily, isn't becoming more digital. Well, I'm trying to prevent that, but yeah. I think it's happening. And COVID has accelerated that. The industry cost $500 billion last year, the semiconductor industry overall. And estimates are $1 trillion a doubling by the end of the decade at that point. I believe those estimates, it's not that there's not going to be some blips and turns on the way. And the majority of that is driven by leadership process technology of which only three companies can satisfy that need. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto, the people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. Welcome to Bloomberg market Asia. I'm Juliette Sali. I'm Richard Salamuddin Hong Kong. Let's have a look at our top so you've got Asian stocks starting the week lower. This after the US jobs number support the case for all aggressive fed reserve tightening. Hong Kong and mainland markets fall after a not so golden week holiday that saw tourist revenue tumble with COVID shadow, looming large. Semican Dr stocks getting beaten up as Beijing wants fresh US curves and access to chiptack. It threatened the industry and the global growth picture. Well, we are starting the week on the back foot when it comes to equities due to that stronger than expected jobs or a port which just has delayed these fears again of a 75 basis point hike once again from the Fed. I guess Tans get it telling us once again, good news is starting to be bad news here. So we are seeing equities coming under pressure today and of course we mentioned the reopen of markets in Hong Kong and China the CSI 300 down 1% and testing those April 2020 lows. A lot of weakness in the tech space which we'll get to in a moment, weighing on Hong Kong's market to we also had the one fix 28 stronger fix than the estimate as we saw that fixing resume. You do have a little bit of weakness strength that should say coming through into both the on and offshore remain being a pick up in the key we there to we are still watching weakness though in the Japanese yen and getting close to that level that we saw on September 22 when there was intervention the yen with a 145 handle there. Commodities looking pretty bright today, but when it comes to the bond market seeing similar moves in Australian and New Zealand debt to what we saw in treasuries on Friday. So you've got the yield on New Zealand's two year up by about 11 basis points and similar to what we're seeing in the 10 years. Well, let's flip the board and have a look at the pain though that we are seeing in some of these chip makers and this is of course in reaction to the news that Biden has expanded these technology curves. We've been seeing smick in particular for quite substantially and we've got B.Y.D. down by about 10.4%. So all of that contributing to a very hefty drop on the Hangseung Tech index this morning, Rich. Yeah, because they're the open that in Thailand now and have it go. What's going on with this?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1358,2022-10-10 03:06:06
13133," So all of that contributing to a very hefty drop on the Hangseung Tech Index this morning, Rich. Yeah, because they're the open that in Thailand. And I have a look at what's going on with the set. And it's following the region down 8-10 to 1%. I can say the dollar again is a climbing against its Thai counterpart about the bar. They're weakening a second straight session. Foreigners apparently dumping the country's stocks and bonds amid jitters over what the Fed's going to do next. Certainly looking at India as well, possibility we'll be seeing a loss there according to that nifty contract. And also we're kind of girting ourselves here as well for what happens with the Rupi is it is tip to extend its recent decline against the dollar. We've got a moment to certainly the reserve banks interventions there not been able to arrest the slide and the currency. And like in prior occasion, so there we go. It's a double whammy of higher US rates and higher crude prices back to haunt the Indian Rupi. Let's get to chief Asia economics course one and the current here. Having a look at this not such a golden week particularly and so give us a sense of what we what we're seeing. Well, right now a lot of the conversation is the shock from US jobs and burs, which means of course the Fed are going to have to be more aggressive. There been some expectation maybe there would be a pivot maybe we slow down in rate hikes, but Fed seems like it might have to go by 75 again inflation this week will dictate where to do go. Of course, that has a global spill over because the Fed will pressure central banks in this part of the world to also have to raise rates and of course it means a strong. But you're only getting the other way of course. Exactly, which is where it comes into China. It's pressuring China's currency. It's pushing you on in the wrong direction. They're not even getting much of a dividend from a week you want at a moment either. So there's a lot going on. A lot of it stems from Fed aggressiveness. The hopes that the Fed might be having to a ease off a rate hikes like a little bit of failure now because of those jobs numbers. You're getting looking for that data deluge as well later on. Yeah, well, there is a lot coming this week, but as I say, the top one is US inflation. That's really the focus because if that comes in pretty high, it will more or less cement that it had fed a husky whatever now thinks it will look to 75. If that comes in materially weaker or slower than anticipated, then that might revive hopes. Hang on a sec. Maybe the Fed does have a glimmer of light here that Fed will ease off over coming months. But I would say the biggest number to keep an eye on this week has got to be US inflation. And I just getting back to the China story, though, too, because we did see some more weak data there as well in terms of the services activity contracting in September. So we're looking ahead as to what we might see from the PBOC in terms of further support. And of course, the party Congress, when does that kind of change the dial if we see a pivot from COVID zero? Yeah, obviously the party Congress is all important gathering a GLA, but it's not clear how much kind of micro policy detail we might get out of it. There will surely be some signaling on what the authorities want for the economy. But you know, it's on it's unlikely. I think that we'll get an expert signaling of a major pivot on COVID zero, which is, of course, choking so much of the activity on the ground. I doubt we'll get micro details on, you know, extra stimulus or support for the economy or specific measures, at least, that usually comes in later meetings, not least the work's conference in December. But nonetheless, you'd have to say the signaling and the commentary that comes out of the gathering will be very important. How much of a focus will they put on reviving the economy? Will there be any hint of a potential move away from COVID zero over the months ahead? But it's unlikely that we get specific details. It's more about kind of a mood music that comes out of that meeting more than anything else. All right, Chief Asia economics correspondent and a current with us in Hong Kong. Let's bring in our guest Hans Gettius founder and CEO of HD Research with me in Singapore. So that's stronger than expected jobs report that we were discussing and then we're looking ahead to inflation. Doesn't look like we're going to get the power pivot. Well, it looks like the labor market is still ready to be strong. And as you mentioned before, bad news is good news. The possibility, you know, I mean, this guy's was good news was bad news. So the market's correct. The possibility of 75 basis points interest rate hike depends, of course, what's going to happen with inflation this week also. But it looks more like 75 basis points right now. The fact seems to be relentlessly determined to raise interest rates further. And what does that mean in terms of these recessionary fears? Well, the problem here is that inflation is actually a lagging indicator. And the problem is that you may push the economy into a recession because you can only cause push inflation that we have now by killing off demand. And that means by definition would mean a recession or at least a high risk of a recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1359,2022-10-10 03:09:35
13134," We kill cost-push inflation that we have now by killing of demand. That means by definition, it would mean a recession or at least a high risk of a recession. Not only that, you're not only in the U.S., but you have a slowdown in China. You have a recession already in Europe, so we have the risk of a global recession looming here. When we look at the earnings picture, though, as well, I mean, we're hoping that there will be some upside there, too. Does that kind of change the picture? So we still continue to watch some potentially movement lower in terms of these indexes when you're already saying U.S. equities are at a bear market and the trend is looking down. Yes. There are in the bear market trend is down. I mean, you have to bear one thing in mind. The bear market does not end when, as long as the fate is raising rates. First of all, they're raising rates into an inverted yield curve, which is unprecedented, really. And earnings eventually will reflect this because you have a time lag of, I don't know, nine, 12 months or so. And incoming earnings may well be lower and earnings downloaded revisions will occur. And given the high level of interest rates, you also have download pressure on the price earnings ratio. So there's a good prospect for prices, and at least in the big index, it's to go lower. Hans, give me a sense of how you sing liquidity, and whether there is sufficient liquidity in the system is QT-gather speed. Well, that's the problem that actually draining liquidity. A QT is something that is sometimes forgotten. We'll talk about the rate hikes, but QT itself is a tightening of several hundred basis points over a time period. So yes, liquidity is a problem. It puts upward pressure on the dollar. And if the dollar goes up, it's a problem for global liquidity. It puts pressure on emerging markets in terms of that servicing. So all this combined is something that you have to worry that the Fed hopefully is not going to overdo it, but there's really a risk of that happening. There's also this, we could be revisiting a housing crisis in the US as well. How do you see that market as rates go up? Well, the housing market is in trouble. First of all, housing or real estate is the biggest item on the household balance sheet. It's higher than stocks. And with mortgage rates going up and demand for housing coming down, so I think there's a good chance of lower real estate values. And that has a wealthy fact. In fact, that has much more of a wealthy fact than a crash in stock market would. So that's something which is cost for worry. And again, raises the prospego or the possibility that the Fed may have overdone it already. That's absolutely possible. I wanted to get back to the China story because we're certainly seeing some pain after that, not so golden week holiday. And as we're talking about to end there are perhaps nothing changes that's going to boost sentiment after the party congress. But where do you see value across assets? Is it looking in bonds? Yeah, bonds might be an opportunity. First of all, the you on is set the multi-year low. Not sure how much lower that can go. It could maybe, but as long as the Fed is raising rates. But bond deals to 10 year deals about 2.8%. I think that would be, that's a place to hide because there's not much else in terms of opportunities. Having said that, the PBOC may well probably caught interest rate. We see some monetary stimulus and some fiscal stimulus. So there could be opportunities in the equity market at some point. But it's a bit too early for that. And I think it would have to be rather aggressive and maybe wait for this party congress to be over. Maybe also trying to see some progress on the COVID-19 policy because that is a huge headwind. Yeah, exactly. That's what's going to change the dial there when it comes to overall EMP picture though and the strength of the dollar. There has been some fairly bullish calls that perhaps the end is inside and you're going to start to see a rally. Do you see that? What's your EMPs? Well, at the moment, it doesn't look like it. But if the Fed work to pause, it will give some upward pressure on emerging market currencies and things. That will be the key. That's the first indicator we would look at. But it doesn't look like it right now. Again, we may be surprised. Maybe there's a surprise coming in the next few months in terms of a pivot, but it does not really look like it at this point. Hans, what is the question that most of you clients really want answered from you? Ultimately, is it about the US emerging market or elsewhere? Well, US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1360,2022-10-10 03:13:31
13135," answered from you. Ultimately, is it about the US emerging market so elsewhere? Well, the US probably not. I mean, I'm not bullish on any equity market right now. Maybe there's an opportunity in India, but also that market has gone up a lot. But if you have a three to five year view, which is rare these days, but if you do, India offers great opportunities because at first of all, just with the biggest growth, GDP growth, about 7.4% this year, it has a young population. So demographics are in favor for a long term investment in India. And of course, you have to reform the Modi reforms that are ongoing. So I think that's a long time opportunity. But at this point in time, I think the best way to do is to hide either in cash or in short, they did US government bonds. I mean, you get risk, you get 4% in US dollars. If you're a mixed as a portfolio manager for balanced portfolio, make 4% this year, you're probably considered a demi-god. Good stuff, Hans. Hans Gertie there from HG Research. And looking at Marcus in the moment, said he chips stocks, really pulling the hang of the same thing. And the reason for that is the topic of our first word news from Vonny Kwen in New York. Right, where is China criticizing the expanded US restrictions on its access to semiconductor technology? Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mauning called them on fair and said they will also hurt the interests of US companies. She believes they'll harm supply chains and the world economy. Recent US measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities. South Korea says its military will boost security cooperation with the US and China, including the deployment of what it calls US strategic assets. This comes after North Korea test fired two more missiles on Sunday. Seoul says the provocations violate UN Security Council resolutions and will strengthen sanctions against its neighbor. The Biden administration says it remains ready for talks with North Korea on removing nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula. But National Security Council spokesman John Kirby also says Washington is increasing military cooperation with South Korea and Japan to counter threats from Kim Jong-un. North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday adding to 10 it launched over the past two weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In his first comments on the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service alleging they had helped from some Russians as well as unnamed foreign states. Kiev is not officially claimed responsibility for the past, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp.

And as most of the world moves on from Covid, President Xi Jinping has set to trump its strict measures to control the virus. Doing so at China's once-in-five-year party Congress details coming up on that, but they're going to leave you with the images now of what's going on in Taipei. These are pictures coming from Taiwan's national day parade. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1361,2022-10-10 03:17:26
13136," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to crowds America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This October delegates will meet for the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. As questions mild about China's economy, COVID-0 policy and foreign relations, President Xi Jinping is looking to secure an historic third term. Keep it tuned to Bloomberg for the up to the minute coverage and expert analysis you need. This begins October 16th with special Sunday programming on Bloomberg, your global business authority. All right, well, we are counting down to that China Party Congress. But of course today we are watching weakness after the not so golden week holiday. The Hang Seng index down by 2.5% with chip stocks tumbling as President Biden expands technology curves and that is weighing into the Hang Seng tech index. While the CSI 300 is now testing April 2020 low, so if it holds at these levels, it will be its lowest close since the height of the pandemic. We've certainly got a lot of a lot of American tensions in the spotlight. And of course, Rish, that not so golden week. No, it's only a let's have a look at all this in the company of Bloomberg intelligence equity strategist, Marvin Chen. Marvin, not a great reopen here, certainly here. But what's really causing the pessimism? Well, yeah, I mean, it looks like the A shares missed out on the bounce last week as global equity ended on a week or no after the US jobs report. And this week, we said the CPI data to contend with. This just goes to show that even A shares are less correlated with global markets. The Fed and dollar impact at the moment are just too large of a headwinds overcome. And things are not looking much better on the domestic side, soft golden week consumption data. And up to COVID cases may also drag on sentiment. So putting this all together, we think we could be looking at another week of volatile trading. When we look at consumption amidst the rising COVID cases in China, what sort of movement are we seeing? Is there actually going to be any change in COVID-zero policy as we look ahead to the party Congress? Well, market expectations for golden week spending were quite low, kind of given the heightened sensitivity around COVID cases heading into the party Congress. But broadly, the week spending data still shows low consumer confidence. Some of this may be due to COVID restrictions, which we think won't see any major shift in the near term. The other major issue impacting consumer sentiment is the property market and the negative wealth effect it is having on spending. So we think we may not see a stable consumption recovery until the property market issues are resolved. Okay, now what are we likely to get to this party Congress? So what are we focusing on? And are we likely to get more policy support? Yeah, the party Congress is largely a political event, but we can get some hints of policy direction shortly after.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1362,2022-10-10 03:21:45
13137," Board. Yeah, the party Congress is largely a political event, but we can get some hints of policy direction shortly after. Of the two biggest issues, COVID and the property sector, we think the property sector is likely to get more support following the Congress while COVID policy may only be tweaked gradually. For property, we're still expecting further interest rate cuts, intradable archives to support liquidity. And from the fiscal side, we could see more special loans and bailout funds to help developers complete-stalled projects. Local governments may also be called on to relax purchase requirements to stimulate demand, but these policies will likely vary from city to city, and some of these are already underway. All right, Bloomberg Intelligence, Equity Strategist, Marvin Chen, thank you. Play more ahead on Markets Asia. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to do. We use the power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How will we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. A year back with Bloomberg Markets, Japanese electronics joined to Seiko Epsom, says it may be forced to raise prices because of the chronic supply chain upheavals, our own Annabelle Drillers spoke exclusively with the CEO, Yasunori Agawa, who also gave us an update on the company's moves to reduce its environmental impact. Yes, we're steadily making progress with our plans to shift all of our operations to renewable electricity by next year. It's all on track. We really hope that people around the world can share increased awareness of the climate change issues facing us, and we want them to understand Epsom's contribution to mitigating this problem. When you talk about that greater focus on climate change, how would you see that shifting consumer patterns generally? To help relieve the climate change problem, we believe we have to put a lot more effort into making products more recyclable and easy to use. We want our customers to use our products much longer than they did in the past, and if we achieve that, I believe we can help people to deal with climate change. Epsom's eco-printer doesn't use cartridges, and if you replace a laser printer with an inkjet printer, there is significantly less energy use as inkjet's don't use heat. People can also contribute to the environment by choosing",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1363,2022-10-10 03:25:45
13138," And if you replace a laser printer with an inkjet printer, there is significantly less energy use as inkjet's don't use heat. People can also contribute to the environment by choosing a product with far fewer replacement parts. In commercial and industrial printing, traditional analogue textile printing uses a lot of resources, but by converting to digital technologies, we can dramatically cut down on waste. We can also make a shift towards much more on-demand printing. These are the kind of areas that Epson is putting a lot of effort into. I'd like to just ask a few more questions about Epson's business, because that's a lot of interest to our viewers. So starting with higher material and logistics costs, because they have been a big drag on the company profit in previous quarters, would you still see that being an issue now? Logistical issues are continuing and the cost materials such as semiconductors well, that remains high. But there has been an improvement. However, both of these issues are still impacting our overall business. Epson is trying to respond to these difficulties. Though we're seeing strong demand for products around the world, we are making adjustments, for example, design changes to help mitigate the logistical issues. In terms of demand, because you've got three key markets, the US, Japan and China, how willing are you to pass those higher costs onto consumers, given there's a lot of concern around the overall health of this segment? This is a serious concern for us. Costs are rising significantly, and we have strong demand. We're doing our best to control our costs as much as possible, but sometimes we cannot do as much as we would like. One of the factors that we watch quite closely is this drop-off in demand that we're seeing in the PC market. So does that also signal the start perhaps of a demand-side slide for your market as well? We're not feeling significant impact there. We see strong demand for working from home products and printer demand is still very robust. What about the weakness that we see in the yen, because we've seen a lot of companies inside Japan forecasting a rate that's much stronger than the one it is today? So how do you see that impacting Epsom's next set of earnings? For Epsom, obviously, weakness in the yen has an impact where we have to purchase parts and materials from overseas, but on the other hand, when we export our products, it is cheaper for people to buy them abroad. At the moment, the impact of the weekend on a business is pretty much balanced. I was Saco Epsom CEO. Yes, and Ero Agawa, speaking to Annabelle Drillers earlier. We'll a quick check now of the latest business flash headlines. Limburgs also say PIMCO 6th Street and a group including center bridge partners are among bidders for at least part of Credit Suisse's Securitized Products Business. We're told discussions have become more advanced with the Swiss Bank due to announce its strategic plan this month. A deal involving the group is a key pillar of plans to downsize its investment bank. Chinese food delivery giant Meituan is said to be considering expanding into Hong Kong and international markets as domestic growth slows. Our sources say plans are in an early stage and Meituan has not responded to requests for comment. Speculation about Meituan's potential expansion has grown since it hired an executive from Quasho technology earlier this year. Australian law firm Morris Blackburn has filed a complaint against mobile phone operator Optus, claiming it failed to protect the personal information of its customers. Last month, the data of almost 10 million former and current Optus customers was hacked. All right, let's have a look at what's going on with the markets and certainly dominated by this weakness for semiconductor stocks in China slumping after fresh US curbs on China's access to American technology.

It is 11.29 AM in Shanghai Chinese markets about to go on a break in a minute and returning from that golden week holiday on a not-so-golden note. The Shanghai compound is 4.10%. We're looking at the CSI 300. It is headed for its lowest close since April 2020. We also have the Sino-American tensions in the spotlight with chip stocks tumbling with President Biden expanding the technology curve. That has been weighing in to a lot of the players in the Hong Kong market and flowing through into Shenzhen as well. The China X is down by about 1.2%. We had a strongly won fix for a 28th day as that fixing room resumed. You are seeing a little bit of strength today coming through in the offshore one at 7 spot 1197. All right. Let's have a look and consider it more on what's going on in China. The most of the world does move on from COVID-19. President Xi Jinping has said to use that once in five-year party Congress which is coming up to trumpet his strict measures to control the virus. John Lewis, our greatest senior, a China senior executive entity, joins us now. So we are getting into Congress mode and all sorts of things swirling around. But has he got much to be proud of given there's also a fresh outbreak taking place? I think what we hear from President Xi this coming Sunday, it will be about how his tenure in office has taken China to new heights. Even when it comes to COVID, I think we are going to hear about how COVID-0 has been the right policy for China, how it's prevented deaths, which it has. There's only been about 5,000 deaths in China versus upwards of a million in the US, for example. But I think we are going to hear about how things have been going well, the optimism, the bright side of things. We don't think we'll hear too much about how things have gone poorly. In terms of how the sentiment is on the ground, a really interesting piece on the Bloomberg today, John, about people's, I guess, awareness of COVID-0. Just tell us what the mood is like on the ground. And given the fact we just have had gold and weak, such different kind of scenes in terms of eating out tourism than this time a year ago, and even in 2020, I guess. I think it's really wearing not only on the economy, but just on daily life. This is year three of COVID for China, and the restrictions are more intense than they've ever been. For example, we had a city in Shai Chi Province this week that is locked down without any infections. They locked down the city just as a preventative measure to make sure there would not be any infections ahead of the party Congress. This is the sort of China that we are living in right now, and it is a grind for people wanting to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1365,2022-10-10 03:35:48
13140," Make sure there would not be any affections ahead of the party Congress. This is the sort of China that we are living in right now and it is a grind for people wanting to travel, for people who need to travel for business, for anyone wanting to go overseas to study and come back. All these things have been incredibly difficult and have continued to be in a, and I think it's time goes on that where is going to become ever more pronounced. Good job, I mean all of this coming with this background of further tensions between Washington and Beijing. This time it's got of course surrounding the whole access to American semiconductor technology and it just gives you an idea of how things are really quite fragile there. I think the relationship between the US and China is more tense that it's been in a long time, maybe ever. The chip issue is at the heart of that, it's really at the crux of the competition between the two countries. Chips are so important now, they go into everything from cars to exercise bikes and this is the latest effort by the Biden administration. It was telegraphed before but I think China in its response pointed out that it's going to, in some ways backfire because China is the world's largest market for chips and so denying American companies access to that market is going to hurt those companies. China is putting billions of dollars into its effort to create its own chip industry, to create its own advance chips, whether that succeeds or not is still up in the air at this moment. All right, Bloomberg's greater China senior executive editor John Lou with us in Beijing. Let's head to New York now and get the first word news with Bonnie Quinn. Hey, Bonnie. Hey, Julia, thank you. China has been hit by a rebound in COVID-19 cases following the golden week holidays. It comes just as the country's top leaders are set to gather in Beijing for the upcoming Communist Party Congress as he've all been speaking about. Meanwhile, China's services activity contracted in September for the first time in four months as lockdowns in major cities such as Chengdu, Dampin to consider spending. China is facing a masks proposal for a Hong Kong-like unification system for Taiwan. In the financial times profile, Musk said he would support a special administrative down for Taiwan. On Twitter, China's ambassador to the US thanked Musk, saying the one country two systems framework was key. Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, will pledge on Monday to strengthen the island's economy and deepen ties with Democratic allies if that's in a national day speech. UK prime minister Liz Truss is planning to speak directly this week to mutinous MPs in her conservative party.

Prince President Emmanuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and act responsibly after shortages caused by a refinery strike, left gas stations and some regions completely drained.

Vani, well, Russian president Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of carrying out an attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. Bloomberg opinion columnist Clara Ferrer, Mark Asjohan, is here in Singapore for more. So Clara, we haven't seen Ukraine officially announce responsibility for this, but it does seem like another setback for Putin's military. Absolutely, it's really hard to overstate both the symbolic and the strategic import of what we have here. This is the bridge over the Kert Strait connecting the Crimea and annexed Crimea and peninsula to the Russian mainland. Putin inaugurated it in 2018 when back in 2019 when the rail portion was inaugurated. It is very much a personal project for him, but it's also really important strategically in terms of supplying Russian forces in the South Ukraine. And it's a very obvious target. So Russia's failure here, both the security failure, intelligence failure, and really a propaganda failure, very hard for the Russians to manage. But it doesn't seem like Putin would take this line down, can we expect some kind of retaliation? I'm sure we will, but the interesting thing here is I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1366,2022-10-10 03:39:40
13141," under failure very hard for the Russians to manage, but it doesn't seem like Putin would take this lying down, can we expect some kind of retaliation? I'm sure we will, but the interesting thing here is actually that he was silent for almost a day, almost two days, in fact, after the attack, which is typically what Putin does when he's under pressure. The shape of that retaliation, of course, remains to be seen. The fact that he has called it a terrorist act is very significant when he does leave his options open. I suppose he has to call it a terrorist act really clarulter, because what he's conducting is not a war, but a special military operation. And the thing here is, we are on the Ukrainian side. They haven't actually admitted responsibility. Have they yet? No, we've seen some interesting reactions from the Ukrainians. I mean, from commemorative stamps to a post sort of putting side by side the blast and Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday, Mr. President, member of Putin turned 70 on Friday, the day before the blast. So there's certainly taking advantage. It's a very complicated action to carry out. So very clearly this is the involvement of the Ukrainian forces. I think what we need to see, what we are seeing here, is the strain from Russia, from both the ultra-nationalists really pushing Putin to go much harder. And then Putin himself being much more pragmatic. And I think that's really what the delay and response signals. OK, and you know, there's another aspect to all this, I mean, I'm sure that in Beijing, Xi Jinping has been watching the actions of President Putin. What do you think his takeaways are from all this? Well, I think the number of them, I think from the point of what it means for the way Putin will act, I think certainly that's one of the factors holding back any use of strategic or tactical nuclear weapons. And really that would put Russia in complete pariah camp. On the other hand, all this entire episode for Beijing has been about, you know, what if they were to invade Taiwan, what would they need to do, how prepared would they need to be for all these very, very complicated military and political outcomes. Clara, thank you so much for that. Clara, for every market, it's a blue and low columnist joining us.

Asia's largest IT services company Tata Consultancy Services Meanwhile will report its second quarter earnings. And Trackson Technology launches its IPO today with a price range of 75 to 80 rupees per share. It is looking like we will see downside of about 1.4%. Indian markets open according to the Nifty Futures contract here in Singapore. Jules, we heard earlier from Jonathan Garner. He is more concern is chief Asia and emerging market strategist and he is actually unlike others moving India to underweight. These are the reasons why. More controversially we are putting in place an outright underweight on India. India is really in a completely different valuation paradigm from the rest of our coverage. It is trading at the 95th percentile of its forward PE range, about 22 times forward PE. That means versus for example career 2.5 times the multiple. That is a record valuation premium for India relative to career. Let us have a look at all this and the outlook with a Mumbai based venture capital fund which invests in early stage startups and is backed by veteran investor. Not Mobius, it is called equanimity investments partner, Shilpa Segal joins us now. Thanks a lot for joining us. It does seem odd. Everybody seems very positive on India apart from Jonathan Garner and Morgan Stanley there. But leaving that to one side, what is your take on the buzz there? So as we all are aware today India is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. It is also the fastest growing one. So this itself says that the buzz around India is not unfounded. The startup ecosystem has matured very well in the last few years and it continues to grow in the years to come. So what are you looking at in particular? Where are the startups of interest? What industry groups in particular? When you talk about industry, groups of Sharda, there is opportunity across sectors. We are in the FinTech or consumer tech, even the health tech is shaping up very well. But for us as early stage investors, we are sector agnostic. We like to come into a stage where the companies have just started growing. We are looking at innovative models which are able to use technology and build very capital efficient and sustainable businesses. And the good thing about being sector agnostic is we get to see companies from all these major sectors of our startup ecosystem and their opportunities across. So that is a very good thing for the early stage part. What kind of challenges are you saying when it comes to the fund raising opportunities at the moment, Shilpa? And is there kind of quite a strong demand? Through the fundraising environment has not as a beat and as a voice just as it was in the last year, 2021 was an outlier year. The investors are facing a lot of volatility because of the public markets. There is a lot of uncertainty also. So they have gone into a weight and watch mode and the funding has dried up a bit. But you know having said that most of the effects of that is faced by the late stage companies. Early stage ecosystem, the area where we play in is still doing quite well. It has been stable. And having said that I also believe that the fundraising environment after this rough patch is bound to settle down. Why? Because the domestic investors continue to increase their exposure to the private as well as the public markets. If you see the number of HNI's, family offices and even the registered AIFs in India is on a record high. The local PEDC funds are sitting on a dry powder of close to 50 billion dollars. So that is a lot of money which has to be invested across all the stages in the Indian startups. Let's see. And Shupa, you talked there about some of the domestic money, but what are you saying in terms of attracting overseas capital here? Yeah, you know, when you look at the foreign direct investment in India, that chart is also on an upward trend. We have net inflows of close to 56 billion dollars in the last 12 months. Green Economic Co Jeez.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1368,2022-10-10 03:48:22
13143," you know, when you look at the foreign direct investment in India, that chart is also on an upward trend. We have net inflows of close to 56 billion dollars in the last 12 months, and all this money is going to be invested like I said across various stages in India. So though foreign funds have been pulling out money out of the Indian equities, the private markets of India still continue to be very attractive to the overseas investor. Give me a sense here actually of some of the investments you made, as well, and a couple of names which are kind of peaked my interest. I'm, you know, it portfolio companies such as I believe thinkly and what do they do and so most are saying I can guess perhaps what they make, but gives a sense of why you've invested in what they do. Yeah, so you know, like I said, we look at business models which are innovative and make the use of technology for building capital efficient models and both these companies are squally fall in that thesis. Thinkly is a part of the curator economy which is a very new thing in India. They are trying to help content creators monetize their content which could be audio, video as well as written content. So thinkly is a very new age model and it's still shaping up, it's in the early stages. Some of the things already are on its road. Where are you looking next and I guess what kind of sectors to invest? Yeah, like I said, we are sector agnostic. We are looking at all these sectors, but in India, I think FinTech and even the e-commerce sectors are doing well. If you see both the sectors have demonstrated that they now have enough depth with a lot of models, a variety of companies in the B2B, as well as the B2C segment, these two sectors have raised tons of capital and are dominating the unicorn list and they continue to grow at a very good pace. The health tech sector and the tech sector are also shaping up very well with a lot of models and innovative solutions for local Indian consumer. So I think all these major sectors are doing exceedingly well in India. Sure, but you didn't get to Samoosti Singh, you just about to tell us about that. You can do more. You can tell us about insurance, Samadhan as well. Yeah, inshallah Samadhan is actually one of my personal favorite portfolio companies. It is one of the only companies in India which is not selling insurance or selling insurance products. They are helping Indian consumers solve the very pertinent problem of claims, redress, they are trying to also build up an app which will help the consumer go through their policy and realize if there are any errors right at the beginning. So when the time comes for the claims, they are already set and on a path where there are no hurdles. So this and for all this, they are making use of technology. It's quite an innovative company and it was also on Shark Tank. So yes, that's insurance Samadhan for you. The other one. Samoosti Singh, yes, Samoosti Singh is trying to standardize the Indian slacks market with the use of technology. Samoosti is a very favorite street food in India and what Samoosti Singh is trying to do is bring it to the entire country in a standardized format, the taste, the presentation, etc. And they are also making use of technology to ensure that the demand and supply is matched at any given point of time, the deliveries happen in time. So again, bringing innovation to a very simple model like selling Indian slacks. That's what Samoosti Singh is trying to do. All right, equity and investment partners, Shilpa Sego. Thank you so much for joining us and we should check in as well on the rupee, which has fallen to a record low down by about half of 1% against the dollar to 82.72 and this is we see Indian markets reopen to the downside of about 1.2% on the sand sex and similar losses coming through on the Nifty as well. So continuing to watch the strength of the dollar there and how that's going to flow through into market action as well, the yield on the 10 year 7.49.

13145," As we've seen, the latest business wise headlines let's have a look at the Renault. It is said to be open to cutting its stake in Nissan. So it's saying the partners are ramping up talks over the French car makers plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets. And that's due in early November, where till Nissan is pressing Renault, to reduce its stake to 15% to even up the two car makers shares in each other. Japanese print-term maker, Seiko Epsson, may well be raising prices because of the chronic supply chain upheaval that's been disrupting electronic companies around the world now. But an inexpensive interview with the president and chief executive Yasunori Ogawa telling Bloomberg that demand for printers and work from home products is robust and that the company is doing its best to mitigate production costs. Logistical issues are continuing and the cost of materials such as semiconductors well, that remains high. This is a serious concern for us. Costs are rising significantly and we have strong demand. We're doing our best to control our costs as much as possible, but sometimes we cannot do as much as we would like. India's mint is reporting that Gautamadani and his family are in early discussions with investors to raise at least $10 billion. The report is saying that potential investors insist it's in raise while $35 billion plans are crimes underrisking their approach to endangered lives. We need an immediate help that this point obviously has been a threat to domestic, GIC, and other wealth and private agree LORD's. Alright, let's have a look at what we are looking in the week ahead, wish we had some qianflation prints coming out this week from India, China, the United States wa bothered the US. The US will tighten policy further by recent trading there for the same dollar but they expect Singapore's GDP to hold fairly steady. How much of a boost we got from the F1 weekend when that's reflected in the next quarter? Yeah, that should be good to look at there as well. Let's quickly look at markets as Hong Kong goes off for its lunch break. It is one of the drag the overall region down down to 1.5%. We have a chip weakness in particular out there as well, Beijing and Washington of course so these tensions come to the fore once again as the US slapped to kerbs on China's access to American technology. All of that really against this fear of slow down or recession globally. So now you've been a JP Morgan for about 25 years? Yes. Okay, so and now you run one of the most important parts of JP Morgan which is I say is the asset and wealth management business. What actually is wealth management and how is that different than asset management? Great question. The two are often used interchangeably but they have distinctions. The asset management business is where we manage money on behalf of individuals, institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds. We manage them in mutual funds, we manage them in ETFs, we manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity and the like. And that is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1372,2022-10-10 04:04:16
13146," As we manage them in ETFs, we manage them in single stock, single bonds, hedge funds, private equity, and the like. And that is the heart of the fiduciary business that we run here at JP Morgan. Wealth management is that, plus, understanding someone's entire balance sheet. So for the individuals where we manage money, we also help them with their mortgage. We help them with alone that they might need. We help them with their basic credit card. And so, wealth management is trying to help someone with their entire life, both their assets and their liabilities, their planning, their gifting, the legacy that they want to leave for their families, the 529 plans they need to prepare to get their kids to go through college. And it's a great insight into people's entire journey. I've always been a person who's just been attracted to hair. I like to sit and think and theorize how I can manifest these visions that I have for braiding and how I can take something that may seem like it's a line drawing in my mind and apply that to someone's scalp. We are the only culture that has hair that grows out of our head the way that it does. Anyone from the African diaspora is born with this amazingly curly hair that can be shaped into a variety of different ways of expression. I want black people to love themselves for how they naturally appear and also to appreciate the cultural practice is such as braiding that our ancestors have practiced for centuries. Animationist. Esta So what's up, stories this morning? Market states of Jude after strong US jobs data reinforced the chances of more aggressive rate hikes from the Fed. Kind of stop leaders hold their final gathering before the crucial comment is part of Congress that set to hand Xi Jinping a third term as president. We take a closer look at Goldman's retreat from retail banking as the CEO David Solomon cons that cost of an expensive turn to consume a landing. I'm Arrafik, the Saudi-Rabbi utility whose shareholders include Aramco and Savic, secures enough investor demand to fully cover its IPO within hours of opening order books. Just got an A&M across the Emirates, I'm Yusuf Gameledin in Dubai, another day, another city for you man. Our whole new city is of Rinesdambul and it's phenomenal, I know you're very familiar with this city, but for me it's a whole new adventure on the Vosferis and Turing Iran. But you know there's a huge amount of culture to talk about, but of course we got the markets to talk about as well and no country escapes the savage rally in order. Now we've given back 1% this morning, there's no data but so there's a little bit of a concern but we put on 16% last week so both Brent and WTI don't nearly 1% this morning, just take a look at the trajectory Yusuf from last week, we're up over at 16% Goldman's talk about higher prices Morgan Stanley says, we're circling on a hundred dollar oil, big call action in the 110, 111 area and you are just seeing again real heavy criticism coming out of this kind of 2% of the world's output by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen again talking about the folly of OPEC classes decision.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1372,2022-10-10 04:05:51
13147," heavy criticism coming out of this cut of 2% of the world's output by Treasury Secretary Janet Yallon again talking about the folly of OPEC plus's decision, the IMF. It'll be a hot button topic there. Let's talk about the dollar as well. You're sort of an exurable rise is the line that I've written down here. The drumbeat of hawkish fed continues. Williams talks about 4.5%. Evan talks about 4.5%. Waller says, I don't know how we pause. And in times of brutal angst in markets like the Nasdaq down 4% years of, where do you hide? You hide in King Dollar. Yes, of good morning. Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you what. You look at US equity futures at the moment and we're called lower on the S&P 500 mini bear in mind that we're looking ahead to a very busy earnings week. You've got the big banks from Morgan Stanley all the way to JP, Morgan Delta Airlines, Zinder as well. Outside of the banks as well as TSMC. There is, of course, something to be said about where to hide and Goldman Sachs things that actually the third quarter earnings in Europe may not actually look as bad as suspected. They retain an overweight on value stocks that they think of medium-term SM-Trumi to the upside. GTV go for our clients. Let's talk about the big moves late Friday. The Syrian cross asset vortex. That's exacting a heavy toll on some of the tempted bulls. Almost 95% of the companies in the S&P 500 fell. The Nasdaq was down nearly 4%. Much of these technical indicators we've added here, including the 50-day and the 200-day moving average have been broken. Medley Global Advisor says, trade the bear market on technical analysis and position. Rather than the no pivot outcome. Forget the pivot trade for now. Downside to 3200, then a rebound to 3800 by September. Let's get you to the fixed income spaces. Well, a little bit less liquidity. We have a holiday in Japan. So the cash market is closed. We get a sense of the treasury futures here. And we're seeing those a little bit range bound as we speak. It's going to be a busy week in terms of issuance because we're looking ahead to $90 billion worth of options that's really going to spice up quite an eventful week that was for US treasury. It's madness. Well, it was the ORABA who spiced up our life last week with a dovish hike. Let's see how the Aussies are doing at the moment. Julie, it's Sally's in Singapore with the Asian market. They've had a week off to let their wounds. But it's a brutal return. Good morning, Miss Sally. Good morning, Mr. Cranny. As certainly as look, we do have the regional benchmark index there, but use of alluded to the fact Japan is closed. So is South Korea. So is Taiwan. So that's a bit of a skewed picture. But we really are looking at the weakness that is coming through in China after the return of the not so golden week. And you've got the CSI 300 on the lunch break testing those April 2020 lows. We've been seeing a lot of weakness coming through in Hong Kong's market too. And particularly in these tech players. So not only do you have the concerns about the Fed aggressive tightening and the return to golden week amidst the not so golden week momentum that we saw with tourism very much hit hard. But you've also got Sino-American tensions once again in the spotlight by an expanding these technology curves, which is weighing through into a number of those tech players you've seen, smick full by more than 5%. We're watching the yen too, particularly as the dollar strengthens there. And will we get to that level that we saw on September 22 when there was intervention? Let's flip aboard and have a look at the broader picture of China's economy as we lead into the party congress and what kind of policy support we could see because we did see some weakness once again when it came to the services activity dropping below the reading of 50 for the first time since May. And this is due to the COVID lockdowns in major cities like Chengdu, dampening consumer spending. So just adding to the murky picture that we have seen for the Chinese economy. I think we're looking at a Japan chart there, but certainly in terms of what we've been seeing with some of them, I mentioned in the Chinese economy, Yusuf, it is looking a little sluggish. Yeah, I love the title of the chart. Post sugar push. Jules will compare notes later in the program. And thanks for that. That's Jules Lietsali there. Let's get to a place where there may not be a lot of sugar rush because the further reserve is closing ranks around the goal of quickly raising rates to about 4.5% before holding there with the latest job status and reaffirming traders bets on another big hike from the FOMC. Focus now turns to the inflation data that comes out in the next few days. Let's head out to our chief Asia economic correspondent and the current. So I think that there's this con.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1373,2022-10-10 04:10:18
13148," from the FOMC. Focus now turns to the inflation data that comes out in the next few days. Let's head out to our Chief Asia Economics correspondent and the current. So, Ann, there's this constant drum roll of hawkishness of state-acorice of the inflation pain. How does that set us up for the CPI print? Well, you said there had been some expectation that by now the Fed would be slowing the pace of its rate hikes. The jobs that on Friday has shattered out. There will be no Fed pivot. All the indications are netted. The Fed will push towards another 75 basis points move next month. It will take a lot to knock them off that path. And as you mentioned, we have inflation data this week. Obviously, it's expected to confirm that inflation has already peaked in the US. That won't be news, so to speak. What might be news is it would be if the pace of inflation slows faster than expected. But it would have to slow by a lot more than expected to knock the Fed off the path that they're currently on. Because, like you mentioned, all the signaling coming from the Fed officials now are that they are locked on to their primary task, which is to bring inflation down. And they're going to do that by getting the Fed cash rate up to around 4.5 percent as soon as possible. And that's why markets now think that another 75 basis points move will be the most likely one next month. Even if inflation does slow, as I said, you would have to slow by a lot to really change that narrative. Yeah, and a good to see is that someone says, keep tightening, even as collision looms and the risk of some kind of financial traumatic event might be low. But it's nonetheless, it is there. And let's see what the hot CPI print is this week. Our chief Asia economics correspondent, Ender Karn. Well, let's turn, as most of the world moves from COVID-19, President Xi Jinping, it's said to use China's one in five-year party Congress to trumpet his strict measures to control the virus. So let's bring in our senior editor for greater China, John Lujon. There are signs that tolerance for China's COVID-zero policies that cracking. Our high significant is that ahead of this weekend's event. So China's COVID-zero policy has had its costs, obviously, socially, economically. We've seen this week a city in Shenzhen, and she promised lockdown because just to prevent infections, there had not been any infections in the city, but still it chose to lock down. And so that policy has been prosecuted extremely strictly ahead of the party Congress. That's meant people who are looking to travel, have not been able to, means business people looking to go overseas to do a deal. They've not been able to do that. And so the impact on daily life has been very pronounced. And that's my favorite and ever more unpopular policy. But at the same time, I think what we will hear from President Xi is about how successful COVID-zero has been at protecting people's lives. China's at just over 5,000 deaths throughout the pandemic. That compared to upwards of a million in the US. And I think that is sort of the emphasis we will see from President Xi when he speaks on Sunday at the party Congress. I mean, I just want you to weigh in on the development of the last few hours. And that is the United States expanding some of the tech curves. What are the specifics? And I mean, we're seeing a very real-time market reaction. But what could the deeper implications be? There have obviously been American curves on what semiconductor technology Chinese companies were allowed to buy. That's being escalated with this latest move by the Biden administration, which specifically targets AI and supercomputing applications and chips that go into those applications. The economic impact, I think, is longer term for any company in China looking to develop an AI technology. I think this is a risk that has suddenly appeared. And I think you're seeing that reflected in the stock market. Obviously, AI, supercomputing, those are integral parts of the future economy that China is hoping to build. And so not having access to that technology puts a great risk that future. Obviously, China is trying to spend a lot of money to develop its own chips. But a lot of questions about whether it can do that. Yeah, the whole localization ambitions question. Thank you for the analysis, John. Much appreciated.

13149," It's Bloomberg's greater China senior executive editor, John New. Now, changes in the economy and pressure on the banking sector in general have caused the CEO of Goldman Sachs to abandon plans to dominate in the world of retail banking. That's the focus of our latest big take, which looks into Goldman's retreat from retail. Let's get more from Bloomberg's senior editor for Asia Finance, David Scanlan. David, so the CEO kept doubling down and doubling down. Quarter in, quarter out. This time, it looks like he needs to retreat. Yeah, in Kudos to Sri Netterage and for this great piece about Goldman Sachs. Remember, this is Goldman Sachs, right? It's the ultimate bulge bracket Wall Street firm. They do IPOs, they do mergers, they manage money for very rich people. But for the last couple years, they've been trying to get into the consumer banking. It's credit cards, it's high interest savings, those kinds of things. Not your typical Goldman Sachs product. And Sri points out the peak of this pitch, as it were, was reaching out to Reese Witherspoon rather. The actress in Hollywood, if you want to go mainstream, you want to go to Hollywood, right? Well, it didn't quite work out. There was no deal with Reese. And they've really been dialing back this whole effort. It's been proven to be very expensive in these new customers. It's been proven to be very unprofitable. Their losses are up about $4 billion now. So they're really dialing it back to this effort right now. So the question that goes through my mind, and I know we've written about this a few times, is if you're sitting on the investment banking desk, sorry, not on the investment banking desk, they're under pressure, the deals desk are under pressure, the flow side of the business is doing quite well. I mean, they're going, we're piling this money into a business which is taking away from us, it's taking away from the pie. Is there an internal dislocation between the focus on retail and what the Holy Grail is within Goldman's, which is, you know, IP? I think there is a bit of internal frustration. I mean, to be fair, it is bringing in a lot of money. They've raised about $100 billion in these deposits for this effort. But I think they're realizing that we, as a standalone business, is just not working out very well. Why not tie it in with our wealth management business? We know that very well. We've got lots of wealthy customers who could perhaps use some of these products. They also reach out to some of the corporate clients that they have. So if you're a big company, you're an apple, you might have Goldman Sachs manage some of your employee money. Let's funnel it that way. So they're not giving up on it, but they are clearly not committing the resources they had initially planned to do because it's proving to be too difficult. Okay. Let's see how it turns out. I see you're editor for Asia Finance, David Scannan there on The Big Take today. Let's get across for the first word headlines from around the world to Simon Foxman, excuse me, and I'll have some on. Good morning, men. As Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annexed Crimea to Russia. In his first comments, since the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service, alleging they had help from some Russians, as well as some unnamed foreign states. He has not officially claimed responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp. South Korea says its military will boost security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, including the deployment of what it calls U.S. strategic assets. This comes after North Korea test fired two more missiles on Sunday. Seoul says the provocations violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and will strengthen sanctions against its neighbor. In the U.K., Prime Minister Liz Truss is planning to speak directly this week to mutinous MPs in her conservative party. Chancellor Kwanzeh Quartin was set to address a regular meeting of lawmakers on Wednesday, but Truss is now expected to replace him. A poorly received tax cut package and a fractious annual conference have Truss fighting to regain control of her party just a month into her tenure.

The transport minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries, affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Global news, 24 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 7,700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Simone Foxman. This is Bloomberg. You sir. Thanks, Simone. Let's get you out of a snapshot of what else to come on the program. The managing director of Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs. That's Wille Monson. He's going to join us to discuss the state of the Middle East economy. We're also going to hear from Shirak Do Shihiti, Qatar Insurance Group, CIO, on some new deals and emerging volatility. I'm Max Marmath, the head of the Asia Research at Ulyus-Bak. Join the team to talk feds at the market moves and volatility across the assets where to deploy in a time of angst on Bloomberg. How much I could push Haviseen from the Qashirah government in terms of green funding? The Qashir administration has committed to doubling the amount of investments in so-called green technologies. I think we need more than just pronouncements. We need real money backing, very innovative startups and innovative companies in this space. What do you make of Qashirah's new capitalism? Well, I think he is framework is reflective of the challenges that Japan's society is facing, namely that growth has been present, but growth has not been, of course, evenly distributed. But frankly speaking, it's hard to register the income if you don't have how much income to begin with. If the government and private sector can work together and collaborate to drive more innovative growth startups, that can really drive the income growth that the Qashirah government needs to redistribute. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other, and we just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slow, managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German power was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. Not only does it have to overcome inflation, but it has to restore its credibility. So yes, I fear that we risk a very high probability of a damaging recession that was totally avoidable. I think I believe that earnings, the earnings slate that we've got...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1376,2022-10-10 04:22:11
13151," live poll that we've created at Bloomberg, 724 individuals surveyed the M Live poll, 60% believe that earnings, the earnings slate that we've got coming up will propel equities lower, JP Morgan, Walmart and Apple will be the key to the earnings outlook. Let's begin the conversation with our guests, it's Mark Matthews, head of Asia Research at Julius Burham Mark. I know that we were setting you up there and perhaps you missed what Larry and Muhammad Ali are in had to say, but to Larry Summers Point, the Fed are going to keep tightening, even as a collision course looms. And if you look at the language from the Fed, we're not talking about 4.5%, 5%, have equities all but priced in 4.5%, but credit has yet to catch up. Good morning. Good morning, man. My answer to your question is that we do not think the Fed will hike 2, 4.5%. And if we're wrong, the market's going to go down a lot, but we are thinking 50 basis points on the 3rd of November and that's it. And of course, the inflation's got to continue to go the right way, but I think it is. And I think everybody looked at the payrolls as a hot number, they weren't. They were substantially lower than the average year to date or August. So we're looking at the glasses being half full despite the fact the market's going down. All right, Mark, with that in mind, how do you approach the current levels in valuations both in the US and elsewhere? I mean, if you're saying they're not going to go that far, so it's going to be like you might want to start positioning for a bottom, but what does the execution look like? Well, we bought puts back in August, expecting a very choppy and volatile market. And we are looking to remove those sometime before the end of the year. We are expecting year and rally. We think the bottom is in sight and it will be choppy and volatile. But we think we're getting very close. And the reason I say that is we're finally starting to see stresses in the financial markets, which I know that seems counterintuitive. That's a bad thing to see. But we think that will lead to less consumption and investment and slower economic growth, not enough to have a recession, but enough for the Fed to not hike by four and a half percent, two four and a half percent, as I said. Well, there's somebody out there who's been a million bucks on the VIX going to 150. So they spend a few dollars on convexity. That's for sure. Okay, this is a big call. I think it's a big call from you that says that we're at or near a bottom. So what does that then mean for treasuries? We're seeing foreign institutions bail on treasuries at record rates. I think that might be to do more with FX intervention. But if we're basing out, as you say, on the downside and on the Fed, what does that do to the treasury market market? Excuse me. Well, Manus, I think to your point, it probably means that it shouldn't go up that much more. And I'm not saying this is going to be a smooth ride, by the way. I don't want to sound cavalier. We're in a bear market. But if you look back in history, bear markets that were not accompanied by severe recessions, even the ones that were just accompanied by fairly light recessions, didn't go down much more than 20%. So the S&P's down 24% from its third of January high. And what I would simply say is we've already priced in a mild recession. For the record, I actually don't think we're going to get a recession. But if we do, I believe it will be a mild one. And meanwhile, we've got the inflation indicators starting to really turn around. Importantly, I think in some of the ones that have been stickier, like rent prices, the base effect from healthcare will start to moderate that. So, yeah, I think we're getting toward the bottom here. I mean, I want to just flesh that out because you talk about some of the major gauges around CPI. And I'm thinking of some of the shipping congestion, which has begun to ease. It's one of the most red stories on the terminal. There's several charts to go along with the story, including one that shows the difference between 2015 and 2022. And how that drawdown has occurred. Where within the CPI basket do you expect the most material changes when the data hits later in the week? Off the top of my head, I actually can't answer that question very well. But it's clear the market is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1377,2022-10-10 04:27:08
13152," data hits later in the week. Off the top of my head, I actually can't answer that question very well, but it's clear the market is expecting a higher core inflation number than in the previous month in a lower headline inflation number. So intuitively, it should be in more of those flexible items like energy and food where we see the declines. But beyond that, I don't know if I could specify that much in detail. Mark, well, even there. Thank you very much. That's Mark Matthews head of Asia Research at Julius Behrou, trying to absorb some of the commentary. There are a lot to cut through. It's still much more to come. This is Bloomberg. So, I'm going to start with the question. Some of the cryptocurrencies have been very popular. If a client came to you and said, look, I'd like some cryptocurrencies in my portfolio, what would you say? We've actually been really deep into crypto, deep into learning about blockchain and all of the new businesses. I would characterize this as crypto learners. We have made a series of toe-hold investments on behalf of our clients, both in some of the currency baskets as well as with some venture firms that are investing primarily in the crypto area. I think it has the potential to be completely game-changing, but it is still such the wild west. And so, it's so uncertain. But it has the potential to completely upend everything. Welcome back to the program. Most of the Middle East equity markets were actually trading on Sunday with the exception of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. So, we got a good sense of both liquidity and risk appetite. In the case of Tadal, that wasn't the case. It was risk aversion. It's about 1.6% with a big mits from Al-Maria. It's one of the heavy weights on the Saudi stock exchange. And we'll get to that in more detail momentarily. Also, a little bit of downside that in Qatar, the two closures there to buy an Abu Dhabi, that is from late Friday. We'll see what kind of catch up happens when they come back online within the next 90 minutes, man. Yes, if I'm looking forward to how credit sweeps actually opens on the day. We've got this obviously monster move on Friday on the back of them buying back their debt. So, that will strike one by the new CFO, $3 billion debt buyback. But the Bloomberg scoopers, of course, the securities business, the SPG unit, is up for grabs. We now know that PIMCO and maybe center bridge could be bidding for this unit. The ADRs had a monster rise of over 12% of the closed business in the States. Let's see how we open today the beginning of a recovery in CS.

What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is the McDade Brake Middle East. Our top story is this morning. Market stains of due that are strong US jobs that are reinforced the chances of more aggressive rate hikes from the fat. China's top leaders hold their final gathering before the crucial Communist Party Congress that set the hands using ping a third term as president. We take a closer look at Goldman's retreat from retail banking as the CEO David Solomon kinds the cost of an expensive term to consumer lending. Anorath and the Saudi revenue utility who shareholder to food, aramco and sabak secures enough investor demand to fully cover a type of year with an hours of opening up the order books. Let's circle back to the markets in Asia. See how they're holding up in the last 25 minutes. Julia Sali joins us again from our Singapore studio. Jules, how's the session matured? Well, we are not looking very good today, use if you know that China and Hong Kong are on a lunch break at this time. So no change in those markets, but certainly that is where the weakness is as we saw a not so golden return from golden week. The Hanks saying index is down by two and a half percent in the morning session and certainly a lot of weakness coming through in those tech players as we continue to see sign or American tensions in play as well. President Biden expanding these technology curves. You've got China's market also under pressure holding around April 2020 lows as it resumes from that golden week holiday. We've got all the concerns about what's happening to the global economy, but also you had a pretty dire outcome when it comes to tourism and consumption spending given the strict COVID zero policies that are still in play. We're also watching the New Zealand market under a bit of pressure and it's kind of interesting day because Japan, South Korea, Taiwan are closed. So giving us a little bit of a skewed outlook when it comes to the regional benchmark index, but certainly lower for a second session. We had a stronger fix from the PBOC for a 28th day. You have seen a bit of upside coming through in the on and off shore currencies, but you can see most of the currencies lagging against the dollar and we are seeing some weakness too in the bond market, specifically in New Zealand and Australia. So some big moves coming through on the two and ten year yields in New Zealand, Manus use of. Well, they certainly rock the market for a couple of days last week, didn't they, Jules? Let's talk about some of the brightest spots. So they're probably stopped.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1379,2022-10-10 04:37:29
13154," market for a couple of days last week, didn't they? Jules, let's talk about some of the brightest spots. So the property stocks in China, what are the details? If we move from zero, COVID and beyond, is that what we're trading on? Yeah, well, indeed, we're looking ahead to the party congress and whether or not there is going to be some relaxation of curbs that will start to support the broader economy, particularly after we saw that Taisin activity index fall below 50 for the first time since May. So one bright spot today is in this property space. You can see the Bloomberg index of China developers up by about half of 1%. Hopes at Beijing will be offering some more supportive measures at this party congress. We did see new home sales by floor area dropped by almost 38% on the year over the week long national day. And CIMB says that the Golden Week sale decline is a little disappointing. So these bad numbers just continuing to stir expectations that regulators may launch more supportive measures to reverse some of those weak trends, Yusuf Manus. Jules, thank you very much for that. That's Julie. It's out of there with a deeper analysis on some of the moves in the Asian markets. Let's get back to this part of the world. Marafec the Saudi Arabian utility whose shareholders include Aramco and Sabeck secured enough investor demand to fully cover it up in terms of the $897 million initial public offering within hours of opening the order books that comes as Al Mariah kicked the earnings season off with profit at missed the average analyst estimate. Let's bring in Walid Moss and he's a, of course, an expert on the subject. He's the managing director of global investment research at Goldman Sachs. Walid just in terms of this latest IPO, how does that kind of fit in the picture with readily available liquidity and interest on behalf of investors? Good morning, Yusuf. Yes, so I won't be able to comment specifically on any of the names, but I would say in general, if you look at the exchanges across the region, there has been a strong primary market activity. And when we look across EM exchanges within our coverage, you can see that the region has seen strong interest both in terms of primary activity and strong investor interest. And that's something which you see in the primary market and you also see in the secondary market. Well, he, good morning. Good to have you with us. So let's see how this IPO goes. I'm just curious within the global context. You know, I've had a number of countries in the past four weeks and the strength of the dollar is pervasive in every country that I have been to. To what extent is the strength of the dollar driving flow to the IPO landscape inside the, and to a certain extent, flow of money into this region, our region, despite the turbulence in global markets? Yes, that's an extremely fair observation. If you look at some of the other emerging markets, one of the key investor concerns has been around EMFX, especially in the wake of a stronger dollar. And given the region with the pegged FX to the dollar, that's another strength. People are looking for investors are looking for US dollar returns and the region does offer them. And given where commodity prices are, that's another strong underpin to the region's investment theme. And as a result, both within the primary and the secondary market, you're seeing that strong level of interest from global investors. In terms of some of the research that you've put out over the weekend, one includes a paper on what's going on with Saudi banks. And you've looked at the liquidity, both by nature of the Interbank rates, but also in terms of how do the two conclusions investors need to take away as they count down to their earnings announcements in the next two weeks? Yeah, so look, I think there are a few drivers of credit growth in Saudi Arabia at this moment. Number one, obviously, mortgage is a stop of mind for investors. We do expect around 20% keg of for the next three years, which is pretty strong. We also expect double digit growth in the corporate space, which is also equally strong. And then one of the other factors we've highlighted is SME. We argue that SME may be the next mortgage like credit growth driver. And you can see a very strong growth underpin from the SME space. So first point, credit growth should remain strong in the medium term. The other thing which we've been talking about is the underpin from higher rates. And the rate-sensitive corporate banks are key beneficiaries of that. So if you were to look at the earnings over the next 12 months, including.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1380,2022-10-10 04:40:14
13155," This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geocolatal potential rises. Now, to a major asset management tie-up in Qatar, one of the region's largest insurers Qatar insurance company has bought a 51% stake in Q Investments Management Business. Now called Epicure Islamic Investment Management, the Venture manages $7 billion in assets. Shirok Doji, a easy chief investment officer at QIC and a board member at Epicure Investment Management, he joins us now with our colleague, Indohasimod Foxman. Shirok, just give us a sense of some of the ambitions that come post this deal. What's in reach and what would you like to achieve as we go into the next year? Thank you guys. Good morning, everyone. The ambition of force is to grow the asset management footprint of Qatar insurance company. QIC is the largest insurance company in Middle East and North Africa. And asset management business comes naturally to insurance companies. We set up Epicure Investment Management in 2019 under Qatar Financial Center, regulated by QFCRA. It's been a conventional investment manager managing close to $7 billion of investment assets. What we lacked was in Islamic arm and this was an interesting opportunity for us to acquire 51% of Q Investment Management Business, which is Islamic in nature. It allows us to now provide a sharia compliant solutions to our clients. But the part from here for us is to grow further organically as well as in organically in the region, Qatar particularly and generally in GCC and Meena region. Shirok, there's a lot to unpack there. And in your last announcement, you said we've reduced our exposure to severe risks globally. And instead, we focused on more predictable retail markets in our region. So if growth is part of the narrative, are you ready to buy Islamic businesses? Is that part of the structure? Are you going to be in an acquisition mode rather than organic mode in this business? So yes, I mean risk reduction on the insurance side internationally has been something which we've even embarked on for the last four years, but that's more on the insurance side. Asset Management is a unique business for insurance companies. It provides income without any capital strings attached as you can imagine. It fits well to optimize returns for the shareholders. In terms of growth, we have both the options open. Organic growth is important. We are seeing a lot of money flowing into the region because of the oil prices and because of the dollar-based nature of the markets. So organic is natural, but we will also not shy away from an organic growth like you saw with acquisition of given-vest business. We will look to acquire more businesses in the region. How money flowing into the region? How does that oil money, which is mostly invested in sort of national businesses? How does that drive your increased clientele? Are you seeing more demand from institutions? Are you seeing this from wealthy people? How does that filter through to the kind of clients you're speaking to? So the clients for Epicure are institutions largely and it's natural that countries like Qatar, which have been usually benefited because of the Russia-Ukraine war. The flow of money is coming into the institutions as well as to the government sector. Our clients in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1381,2022-10-10 04:47:21
13156," solutions as well as to the government sector. Our clients include pension funds, certain listed companies in Qatar, at the moment as well as some other non-listed large institutions. They are all being benefited by the flow of money which is coming in and that's going to help us sort of grow our AUMs within Qatar. Sure I get it's been a painful year for a lot of investors. Bonds got wiped out, right? Worst year, you know, I mean if you can count back all the way since 1960 stocks got hit hard as well. What's changed for you in terms of the paradigm of asset allocation given some of these historic moves that are new to all of us? Right so if you look at equity markets, you know, Epicure focus is predominantly on the region. The region, the equity markets in the region actually have been benefited or have performed well this year compared to this rest of the world. Qatar for example is about 12% Saudis, about 3%, 4%, Abu Dhabi is about 15% for the year. So we have, you know, our equity mandates are equity portfolios. While we have de-risked them off-late but we were aggressive in the first half of the year with the oil prices about 100. Fixed income and so cooks I think that's definitely an area of concern and has been an area of concern. We had reduced the duration. Let's take a little bit deeper. I mean there has been an annihilation of Pond portfolios across the world. The Gilt Marker broke two weeks ago. Have you materially reduced bond exposure at a sovereign level in the GCC or globally? Look, I mean the markets have completely got destroyed. The more portfolios have got destroyed globally but the spreads and the region have remained very solid again due to the strong fiscal situation. We have reduced the duration of the portfolio significantly. We've gone in very high quality front end which is, you know, two years, three years, reduced anything about five or seven significantly in terms of portfolio allocations. Not sure whether that answers your question. Let's talk a little bit about alternative assets. You're also invest in private equity in real estate. Is this the moment to jump in to deploy some of that dry powder and where are you putting your marginal dollar? I think the marginal dollar definitely is not getting into risky assets. It's getting into the front end of the high quality fixed income market or in money market funds to be very honest at this point in time. There's no point being in putting them the marginal dollar as you said in risky assets like private equity or in real estate. I think we'll get better opportunities in 2023 to deploy that into those key assets, generally. So, I didn't get the chance to push back. So let's round off with one last hurrah for Ray Dalio. In your mind, Shirag, you're at the short end of the curve. You've reduced duration. Is cash? Trash? Well, cash is not trash. Cash is definitely yielding a lot more than what it was yielding last year. But at the same time, look at two year and three year rates. You're at 4.3 on the front end. Add a little bit of credit risk. You're hitting 5.5 on a high quality front end fixed income. So yes, well, cash is good, but I think in the front end real estate, front end fixed income is looking particularly attractive for us at this point in time. And you need a new dollar depot. I kind over the chosen bank and Dubai. Shirag, we wish you well with the volatility. Three times better interest when you have a set it. Thank you. Thank you. You should have me bankrupt myself in the morning. Shirag.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1382,2022-10-10 04:51:49
13157," Well, with the volatility, three times better. I'm going to be free of it. When you have a set it. Thank you. You should have me bankrupt myself in the morning. Sure egg. Well done. Great to have you with us. And joining us here, Shurek Doshi, the Chief Investant Officer, IQIC, and a board member at Epicure Investment Management on New Duration. Let's continue the conversation. Let's get to Simone. She's got the regional investing picture in terms of the data Simone. Of course, we have the inflation order waiting for the US CPI print. But regionally, we're waiting for the Egypt print. What do we expect? Yeah, that's right. Economist expect that inflation is going to continue to accelerate in the month of September after hitting 14.6% in August. That was already the highest number that we had seen for inflation since November 2018. We expect this to come on the back of rising food and beverage costs. That's really key here, because even though we've seen food prices around the world come down a little bit over the last couple of months, Egypt's simply not feeling the same thing that everybody else is. And when you look at the market picture and where the reaction could be, we're going to be very closely watching the Egyptian pound. We have a GTV go showing what has happened there recently. Investors expect the pound to continue devaluing over time. But we've really seen that pick up the weakest offshore market print back on Tuesday. We could see that affected if we see higher inflation numbers coming through. Yeah, I look at the Egyptian pound's spa rate. And it's pretty much a currency in denial. It's like a relationship that just isn't working and needs a reset. We'll see what it will get that in the dollar Egyptian pound. What about the process in Iran, Simone? Because those have entered their fourth week now. What's the latest? Well, it appears that at least 185 people have died in these protests. Some 19 of them children. That's the latest read from Norway-based Iran human rights. These protests, again, sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old who was detained by morality police and died in custody. We've seen really flagrant pushback against the regime, really escalating over the past couple of days. For example, on Saturday, President Abraham Raecey, he was speaking at Zahra University, that is an all-female university. And his speech, furthering this line, talking about his support for security services, that largely overshadowed a couple hours later when videos emerged of women, particularly women's students, protesting outside the very place where he was given this speech. We're also seeing a ramp up of widespread international condemnation. We heard Germany's foreign minister very critical of Iran and the establishment there, starting to call for EU sanctions on the country. Simone, thanks for that. Simone Ploxman, at the Cutter Financial Center in Doha. So much more coming your way. This is Bloomberg. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today?

13158," This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the future. It's now being reversed. It's staybreg Middle East. On the road in Istanbul and Dubai but let's pivot to the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister there let's trust is preparing for a battle. Another battle with the ruling Conservative Party this week to quash any attempt of rebellion just one month into her premiership. Let's bring in Lian Garen's, she's in London so let's trust Lian is starting the week battling for her political career. This is about the back benches rallying against her in terms of complete and utter lack of faith in her and her chancellor. So Manus, a Monday morning comes along and the Prime Minister is again battling to keep her job. We heard about this last week and it's actually not just her back benches who have been rebellious. Also her cabinet ministers we saw that didn't we last week at the Conservative Party conference with people like Penny Morden speaking out against her possible benefits cut when she would not raise benefits with interest rates. She said this is wrong. This is what needs to happen and obviously we saw the likes of the back benches whose Michael Gove and Grant Chaps they really came out and almost forced a U-turn on tax cuts for the highest earners. So once again she arrives back here in London and tomorrow the cabinet will meet and we understand that Liz Truss is going to rally those rebellious back benches MPs and cabinet ministers to make sure she shores up her position and she can get her policies through the government because that's the main part of what she needs to do. Absolutely. There's just so much to consider when looking at UK politics at the moment. Leanne thank you for helping us through that. That's Bloomberg's Leon Garence quick note on gold here according to the CFTC positioning numbers a little bit more interest. In fact the most interest we've seen since about early 2020, intraday at the moment a little bit lower off the back of a stronger greenback to the tune of about half of one percent of the money. But one to watch. Yeah we're going to keep an eye on these equity markets. Danny and I will take us through the next certainly pressure coming to birth as Biden goes down on China with more restrictions on chips and technology. Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today Apple pushes ads in three places the app store Apple news and the stocks app. In the news and stocks apps Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1384,2022-10-10 05:00:29
13159," that car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the app store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. For instance, an app store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apploss Push It To Ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible from advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple CD Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers. I'm Mark Garamant. This is Power On. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. I'm Danny Burger in London with Managed Cranny and Istanbul and these are the stories that set your agenda. Golden Week, Tarnish Chinese markets reopen in the red, weighed down by concerns over rising global interest rates and fresh US curves on tech. Broad-based baritwnist Asian stocks and futures kick off the week on the back foot as the strong jobs report on Friday crystallizes bets that Fed will continue with jumbo rate heights. Plus, Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of carrying item attack on a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea. So Danny, the geopolitical risk is a live and raw with Putin and Russia. But for me, it's a size and the scale of the next move from the Fed. I love Tom Orlick's pace. I recommend everybody read it. It's about talking Volker and walking Volker. Danny, good morning. Good morning, Manus. It's a market that certainly is transfixed by that too. I mean, what a week last week. I'm literally chugging coffee this morning because I'm just unprepared if we have that all over again. So S&P, it ends down 2.8% on Friday. Let me show you what the future session is doing so far this morning, Manus, because it is another day of negativity. Unemployment is still at its lowest in decades. That's giving this market no comfort that we might see any sort of pivot coming from this Fed. That conversation is long gone. So continuing to see losses there. Euro stocks 50 futures. Those also in the red this morning, Manus, that's an intense of 1%. We're also looking at a FTSE 100 futures session. That isn't as bad. It's a great data out from Goldman Sachs that they are buying back British companies rather are buying back shares at the most rapid pace on records. That might be giving us a bit of a lift. But Manus, I really think it's all about this cross asset volatility. It's not just an equities. It's of course in your markets as well. But then that goes back to the whole concept of a Varshock. I should actually say why I've actually come to Istanbul. I mean, first of all, an amazing city. We're here for a couple of markets for them. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got an election next year. We got an election next year for the capital markets for them for Bloomberg. So you know, delighted to be on that ticket. Big shout out to the team. So if you want volatility, you can of course look around the whole of the region here. But Danny, it's interesting to talk about buybacks in UK stocks because of course Credit Suisse can't do monster debt buyback and reset the narrative there. But to the market. And comes out over the weekend. It's on my LinkedIn. She says really lambassy the move of a cut of 2% of the output from OPEC. But you can see the market is done by 1% this morning. Aussie is also.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1385,2022-10-10 05:05:06
13160," What she says really lambassy the move of a cut of 2% of the output from OPEC but you can see the market is done by 1% this morning. Aussie is also the pressure this morning. I think you put it to me on the phone when we were talking about it. What's going to be talked about at the IMF meetings? Is it going to be the need for intervention? We're already got intervention. It's just by a softer form. Aussie dollars on the low as as as real concern about global growth is out there. We know the cash is closed. The futures are open. And to that extent, Danny, what is a hot print on CPI of 6.5% due to the Fed narrative? Danny? Yeah. And man, should we go go back to that time or look quick? I don't think we properly got you. I know it's got your eye this morning. Yes. Look, what I liked about this, we've debated what size could it be a fourth 75 basis point hike in a row from the Federal Reserve. This is what Tom Moore, like our chief economist, said. Have a look at it. You've got the advantage of seeing it. I'm in the blind. Apparently there I can see it in the distance. There it is. Talking Volker with a commitment to hike rates. Is there a hallelujah talking like Volker with a commitment to hike rates into tumbling markets and rising unemployment? That is talking Volker. Roll it over, Iling. Let's have a look at walking Volker. Actually, hiking rates when investors are losing money and workers are losing jobs. So far, we've talked to talk. We've not walked the walk. Well, my gosh, if we're about to walk the walk, where are we going to be on rates, Danny? Yeah, and this one I came in the IMF point. I mean, they're also going to have pressure from those global financial chiefs who surely want the Fed to pivot as well. Well, man, let's get to our other top stories from around the world. We're going to kick things off with Garfield Reynolds looking ahead to that US inflation data later in the week. Juliet Sally standing by. She's going to tally the Chinese markets on their first day back from golden week. And Claire Marquet will be covering the latest Russia Ukraine tensions, man. Well, I mentioned the Fed. They're closing the ranks around the goal of quickly raising rates to four and a half percent before hike and hold for longer. The latest jobs print, reaffirming traders, bats, another big hike is on the cards. Next month, the focus turns to the potential for a hot print on course CPI this week. Garfield Reynolds is with us. The Fed speak is in the next hard print Garfield. Is that the fill or kill on 75 basis points and the trajectory to four and a half percent locked in? Good afternoon. Good morning. I'm Alice. Yeah, you're to some extent the CPI standard was almost stolen by jobs because you know, those job figures, 3.5 percent unemployment and still strong wage growth. There's very little look at stop the Fed from going 75 basis points after that. What recession you can hear them saying when you've got a jobs market this tight? Be that as it may, there is the concern that if we do get in particular an increase as everyone expects in the course CPI, that that will further embolden the Fed and that will further dispoint various investors who at times in recent weeks have been either buying stocks or buying bonds or at least saying we should be looking to do so. I think Bill Gross, Jeffrey Gunlack and others who've been saying, hey, bonds on almost 4 percent yields look like they're attractive. But if the Fed is going to go the 4.5 percent rapidly and hold it there at the very least, that looks nasty. What if we get a hotter than expected CPI print on top of the hotter than expected jobs print? That's going to look really nasty. More of that global cross asset volatility than he was talking about. Yeah, that's certainly an understatement. If there's been so much volatility, Garf, it's also great to see you back in the office of rare site these days. But I do wonder when we continue to have this hot data coming in unemployment remains low. What sort of language will the Fed need to pursue with the market that's so willing to chase after this pivot narrative? Well, the Fed's shown a willingness to push back against that. And I kind of think of that there's the old saying the beatings will continue until morale improves. I think for the Fed, the beatings need to continue until sentiment collapses in asset markets. Because until it does, until they get that capitulation, we're going to continue to have this narrative. We're also going to have to continue to have a situation where investors are effectively fighting the Fed by looking for this pivot, beating up asset prices, and loosening financial conditions at a time when the Fed is extremely keen to tighten.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1386,2022-10-10 05:09:36
13161," the Fed by looking for this pivot, bidding up asset prices and loosening financial conditions at a time when the Fed is extremely keen to tighten them because they're saying inflation is all that matters. They're saying they have to quash that and they will do what it takes to do that and part of that is going to have to involve lower asset prices. Yep, certainly. Garfield, thank you very much. Bloomberg's Garfield Reynolds Fair. And it's a not-so-golden return from the Golden Week holidays for Chinese investors. Let's get to Juliette Sally and Singapore who's been tracking the reopen for us. Jules. Indeed, Danny, the COVID restrictions, meaning people staying at home, eating at home, not going to the cinema. Tourism down 26% from last year, down almost 56% over the golden week holiday from pre-pandemic levels in 2019. So certainly investors coming back and selling into these markets admits the concerns that we are seeing globally as well. The CSI 300 now testing these April 2020 lows. We've also got these Sino-American tensions as well coming through in terms of these further curbs on exports for Chinese tech companies. That's weighing very heavily into the tech space today. The Hengseung tech index actually testing its lowest level since January 2019 with a drop of around 4% in the morning session. We did have some more attempts to really try and shore up this currency and you are seeing a stronger offshore you want today with a 28th day of a stronger than expected fix. But certainly it has been a bit of a dampener for investors returning after the golden week holiday. The only bright spot is coming through in some of these property stocks. And that's as we look ahead to the party congress expecting that we will see some more support for the beleaguered property sector when you saw some very weak home sales data. And that is when it comes to the overall data picture. Let's flip the board. We also had weakness when it came to the services picture from the TAYSHAIN gauge. That actually fell below 50 for the first time since May. So just adding to the expectations that we will start to see some more targeted policy support for the Chinese economy when the party congress kicks off on the 16th. Manus. Yeah, Jules, I think if it didn't go on the head with the Siner US relations that we thought that that was going to improve, it certainly doesn't look like it. And the PBOC's own employment sentiment index. The law since 2010, Jules, we are going to be talking about this growth rate again. The fantasy land of five and a half. We are going to be talking about a reality check at two, maybe even lower from these analyst notes. Jules, thank you very much. You will be back with us very shortly with a new line and a new chart. No pressure, Jules. Actually, sadly, they are in Singapore. To Russia, the president Vladimir Putin has accused Ukraine of carrying out an attack that badly damaged the key bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. Putin blamed Ukrainian secret service alleging they had helped from Russians as well as unnamed foreign states. Kiev has not officially claimed responsibility for that blast. So what do we know? And where is Putin going with this particular set of accusations? Our Bloomberg opinion columnist Clara Ferreira, Marquez joins us. What can you tell us? I mean, we saw the potent imagery over the weekend of a bridge on fire in flames and then the blame game began. What is the latest? It's very interesting to point out just how symbolic this bridge is. Remember, it connects the Russian mainland with annex Crimea when it was inaugurated in 2018. Putin himself drove a truck over the bridge, very much a personal project and engineering challenge and huge expense, which was very proud. And Russia had made quite a big deal of how protected this bridge was because very obvious target. Now, after the attack on Saturday, we actually mostly heard silence. So Putin came out yesterday in a very short statement blaming terrorist attacks. And I think what's really interesting here is just how he is still keeping a lot of options open in terms of how he can respond to what is very obviously an attack on critical infrastructure. And so what are we expecting in terms of a response? Is there any clear direction at this moment, Clara? Not really. I think the terrorist attack label is one that leaves quite a lot of options open for Russia. So terrorist attacks remember was what came before the return to Chechnya in the 2000s, the attack on Russian apartment blocks at that point in time. But it also allows him to say, well, it's just, you know, this, it's not a military force, it's a terrorist force, it's something that perhaps we have to deal with with.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1387,2022-10-10 05:13:51
13162," But it also allows them to say, well, it's just, you know, this, it's not a military force, it's a terrorist force, it's something that perhaps we have to deal with, with asymmetric force, for example, with other strikes on infrastructure rather than, for example, tactical nuclear strikes. Okay, Clara, thank you very much for joining us. Bloomberg opinion comments, they're Clara Friera, Mark Hayes. Now let's take a look at some of the key things that we're going to be watching out for this week. ECB's Dovish, Philip Wayne speaking in tomorrow, we're also going to get UK labor market data. On Wednesday, US PPI is out then Thursday, we're going to get that all important US CPI data. Well, inflation still be running very hot. And then Friday, Manus, we're going to have UK home prices. Well, coming up, Danny, the former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, on his eye look for the US economy, potent language will affect, be forced into another jumbo hike. That's right here, on Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. But the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. And moving into a world, we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow.

I actually think it's neither a fracture in all the beginning of a much bigger cell, but instead I think we're nearing the end of the cell-off. If we look back at 2000 and 22...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1388,2022-10-10 05:18:51
13163," It's neither a factor in all the beginning of a much bigger sell-off, but instead I think we're nearing the end of the sell-off. If we look back at 2000 and 22, we can see that this has been a year so far of three parts. He had a first part which went all the way from January to June 15, which was marked by rising one-market yields and falling prices. Then we had a bit of recovery, which lasted from June until Jackson Hole. Then from Jackson Hole onwards, we've had a second sell-off, which went all the way to the current levels that we're seeing. Now, I think we are moving into restrictive territory now, and we're seeing the first signs that central banks are becoming less hawkish. So we've had the reserve bank of Australia last week, which surprised markets by only high-conrates by 25 basis points. The polls didn't do anything, and I think there's a good chance that we're nearing the end of that form of market sell-off. But Christian, to play devil's advocate, Australia, it's a much different market, and currently, money markets are still pricing that the Fed is going to cut next year. Is that an argument that we have yet to reach peak yields, that there's still more adjustment to be done for a Fed who is said to us that they're not going to stop hiking in those stay restrictive? Yes, so those heights, Danny, that are priced into the curve for 2023, I find them kind of puzzling myself. And we do not expect rate cuts by the Fed in 2023. We think they will move to 4.75 or so, and then pause for a while at least, because we do see the effects of the rate hikes on the economy, manifesting themselves. So you're right to point out that there's a kind of a weird shape of the curve with those rate cuts in 2023. I don't think they will come, but I think that's, you know, once we're at 4.75 or so, the Fed has a good reason to stop. Yeah, same holds for these to be, by the way, once we get above 2%, it's becoming more and more difficult to justify further rate hikes in the face of an economic slowdown and recession in the area area. Question, there's going to be, the bomb traders are going to be throwing things at the screen going, oh, you know, just because equities are tanked by 22, 23%. And the curve has moved, and we've dipped into an inverted curve, etc. What is it that makes the Fed stop? Is that that inflation really does? Peek-a-died, now that we have a 2% of the world's oil I'd put, cut and OPEC in cutting mode. Do you think we really are at peak inflation? And is that what helps the Fed pause? Absolutely. And this is why the CPI number that we will get from the US this week is absolutely crucial. So we have to look at this number, we have to look at the core CPI, and if you get further indications that inflation is peaking, then I think the Fed can pause at 4.75%. Now, there's one other thing that we have to keep in mind, there is a collision that Larry Summers spoke about. Now, I think this is a collision between fiscal and monetary policy, which is coming up here. I think that fiscal policy is still way to lose for the situation we're in, and at least in Europe, it's risk getting much looser in response to the very high energy prices. So that is the collision we have to be all very aware of. And if fiscal policy doesn't tighten, if it continues to loosen, then I think we could even see more monetary policy likes. I can't help but think of the UK, Christian, right? This is the shining example of monetary and fiscal policy that are moving in opposition. If your concern is more global, what does it mean for the UK? What you're saying? Because again, that tension there feels especially acute. Absolutely. So we've got this very strong tension between fiscal and monetary policy in the UK. And there's not much left of the Tory government's aspiration of Singapore, or more talking about Brazilian, or even, they have to say, one of the side is on terms. No. So this collision between fiscal and monetary policy is making things very difficult for the UK bond market and for the currency. And I think we do need some fiscal tightening in the UK in order to prevent a big overshoot of yields. So they've had one savage attack on the guilt market. They broke that. They trash-sturling. What will the IMF tell Quasi Quattain this week?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1389,2022-10-10 05:22:29
13164," They've had one savage attack on the guilt market. They broke that. They trash sterling. What will the IMF tell Quasit Quartin this week? Because don't forget, he might need to ring them up next year. It's just a possibility. So what will they be telling him this week? Yeah, so I'm heading off to the sea on Wednesday, Avonni. And I actually think that what happened in the UK, these seven days of turmoil, have set the scene for this year's IMF annual meeting. And they will guide the discussions that will take place there. Of course, we also have issues of financial instability in the UK. We've seen the damage that LDI investment has done on the long end of the curve. It forced the hand of the bank of England. But underlying these technicalities, we do have a conflict between fiscal and monetary policy in a world where we need to tighten policy in order to prevent an unanchoring of inflation expectations and a much more pronounced and longer period of high inflation. So I think what will the IMF tell the UK government? They will tell them to tighten fiscal policy. And they will not only tell that to the UK government, they will also tell them to the Europeans and to other policy makers. The times of easy fiscal policy are definitely over. This is what we have taken away from the turmoil in the bond market of the United Kingdom. Christian, we also have the BOE removing the training wheels if you will on Friday, no longer having what effectively is QE buying the long end of the bonds. What happens when that ends? Is this another bond market where the vigilantes are going to be testing the BOE yet again? Well, the problem is that the BOE has announced that it will retreat from its assets purchase at a point in time where we have no direction yet on the future course of UK fiscal policy. And that does create tension, no? So I think the markets have stabilized a lot over the last couple of days. And the margin calls have been serviced. I think there's a bit more liquidity in the UK pension funds. So the technical issues which have contributed to the rise in bond market yields are not as severe as they were before that intervention. That set the underlying causes of both sterling weakness and the bond market cell of our silent days. And that is sort of, you know, it's a government that is running a very loose fiscal policy at a point in time when the country is running an 8% current account deficit. And the chart that you've shown here on the investors retreating from the US bond market that also applies to England and to United Kingdom investors will be retreating. They will not be wanting to fund a country that runs a huge twin deficit. Well, we'll see whether they take another smack at the currency and the bond market again. I'm to coach Janet Yellen in the FT. She knows the thing of two more than I do. OPEX decision is unhelpful and unwise. It's something that to me, that's her, did not seem appropriate under any circumstances that we face. All is up 16% on the week. What did you make of the OPEC guys and girls taking 2% of the global supply off the table? Yeah, well, that's another one of those fractures. You see the amount of nervousness by Western policy makers about the high level of inflation. They want anything that brings inflation down. And the production cuts by the OSD are indeed not helpful when you want to bring down petrol prices in the US. So there's a discussion about releasing further oil from the strategic petroleum reserve of the United States. But ultimately, these are a little headline numbers. So the more concerned about this really core inflation, that has to do with the labor market. And it has to do with wage pressures. And it has to do with an over-eating economy that is independent of what happens to the oil market. OK, Christian, I'm afraid that's all we have time for this morning. Thanks so much for joining us. Safe travels to DC, this week, Christian competitive fixed income and FX at Union Investment.

Welcome back to Bloomberg Daybreak Europe. Let's get to the first word news now, Simone Foxen standing by in Doha, Simone. Foreign President Manuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and act responsibly after a refinery strike left petrol stations with no fuel in some regions. Transport Minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Chinese chip stocks have slumped after fresh U.S. restrictions on access to technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman criticized the curbs as unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of U.S. companies. Recent U.S. measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance its military capabilities.

13166," There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. In not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years, as soon as the 2030s. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but the link is Bloomberg Ray. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, you're by Manuscrennie in Istanbul with Danny Berger in London, with the stories that set your agenda. Golden Week, Tarnished Chinese markets open in the red way down by concerns over rising global interest rates and fresh U.S. curbs on chip makers. Broad based baritones, Asian stocks and futures also kick off on the back foot after strong U.S. jobs data Friday crystallized bets the Fed will continue with the jumbo rate hike. Plus, Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of carrying out an attack on a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea. The first time in the year, the Fed has been in the U.S. and has been in the U.S. A bruising session Friday continues into a week-feature session. It is all about the Fed and their resolve to continue hiking after that jobs data. Let me just quickly dive into it. Manus, I'll be quick, is basically what you need to know is we're all in the red in this future session. B.S. and P. Nasdaq, whether it be Euro's stocks 50, FTSE 100 futures. There you go, Manus, perhaps a record time of a short equities check as well, but it is a cross-asset picture. I find a fact. The M-Live poll, 60% of the 724 people that we surveyed record that earnings are going to tank stocks. I leave you with that thought. You want to buy value over growth. Let's have a look. WTI put on 60% last week to the world's production came off from OPEC Plus. With that in mind, oil is dropping this morning, nearly 1%. Again, the concern to run global growth, the IMF, meetings, the strength of the dollar. Morgan Stanley still wrecking the clack as I call them. All of the analysts, wrecking will get to 100 bucks. So you've got oil on the dime. You've got Aussie on the offer as well. There is this set of angst of Ryan's, Sino-US relations around chips and technology. Global growth is under pressure. That is putting pressure on there. It is Columbus Day. Liquidity is not really there. The futures are trading as a hedge. If you need to put something on. The IMF is currently in the U.S. It is expected at 6.5% of the 20% of the last print. Let's talk about a little about the IM. Shall we? Expectations for peak and borrowing costs next year are encouraging investors to dip their toes back into emerging market assets. That is mostly because when monetary tightening does ease, investors may find developing equity and bond valuations attractive relative to their developed market peers. Not to mention the carry that you are going to get. Let's speak to Emier Daley, emerging markets macro strategist at net west markets. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We did see a lot in America, a Brazil central banks that they were ahead of the curve. They were really the first out of the gate to start hiking. Does that mean they are in a much better position now than the rust of the globe? Yeah, I think when you look globally, I think it is a really diversified regional story. When you are looking at real carry, it is only in Latin America. Even in Asia, when we have had hiking cycles, inflation is so much lower, you are actually offering real...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1392,2022-10-10 05:35:27
13167," Regional stories. When you're looking at real carry, it's actually only land America. Even in Asia, when we've had hiking cycles and flation is so much lower, you don't actually offer any real carry pickup to investors, relatively as a dollar. And certainly, you know, within the central European space, the dollar definitely it weighs. So I think if you're looking for that lucrative carry story, I would definitely suggest land America, so Brazil, Mexican peso, Chile. I think they offer really good carry pickup and some kind of investor alternative to the dollar. So, Eamara, I'm just looking at my WCRS here. I'm like, I'm like on the road, traveling, will, brewery with the Blueburg terminal. I look at the performance on the rail, up 7.16% so far in the year, but there's nobody can catch up with that. The pesos up 2.5% relative to the dollar and then you got the Peruvian sole. So that differential, is there any exhaustion in the rail or who is it that closes that gap or or I should be betting on the next set of moves to come? Yeah, I think, you know, when we kind of are looking across globally, I think it's very much a case of, you know, what's happening on the current account, you know, balances, seen very much in the years and that they, you know, record deficits as all these people are trying to import very expensive energy prices or in land America in these countries that actually benefit from higher commodity prices. Yes, I get your point that, you know, we've had very extended moves already, but I think those current account dynamics, you know, it is back to kind of, back to basics and currency markets at the moment. So it is that current account dynamic that really stands out. I think the fact that they have so preemptively tied monetary policy to get ahead of inflation, inflation is falling really should stand out to them. I think that kind of contrast what we're seeing in the eurozone where it's actually the opposite story where for some of these emerging markets, they've got record current account deficits and their central banks just can't sustain this pace of high think they have kind of backed off and they were lying on FX intervention or liquidity draining programs just to put their currency. And we saw that in Poland, right last week, they decided to leave rates Pat. When does it get to a point where that reserve draining becomes a problem that they run out of ammo to really help sustain lack of volatility in their currency? I think it's a real risk. You've got important inflation coming in. I think especially for Poland, it's actually going into election next year where they've announced this very kind of ambitious budget. And I think you are going to see a lot of pressure coming on the back end of that curve as investors are quite hesitant to actually fund an economy that seems to be doing discretion, fiscal expansion, while also running a significant current account deficit. To put it in context, you know, we've seen borrow and cost for the Polish government triple. So their annual interest rate payment is three times what it was. They've also got funding concerns from the EU over rule of law and the right to judicial systems. So that's basically clamping down on another source of funding. Eimer, we saw you in a last year intervention by the Bank of Japan and a number of other central banks. Now they have got far apart in a plenty. They have unlimited checkbooks. Unilateral intervention has not stopped the drop in the end. That's G10. But in your opinion, the IMF will verbally intervene this week. I presume that might be the jumping off point. But verbal intervention is not a plaza accord and there's no appetite for G7G20 intervention. What happens next? I mean, how do you see it? Is there room for a plaza 2022? Is there room for unified intervention? I mean, as an emerging market, Afics strategist, I would love if there was. But unfortunately, I don't see anything from the US authorities to kind of come out and kind of talk back the dollar or do kind of any kind of coordinate action. We think about it. A strong dollar is just their benefit. It can't stand on inflation. You know, and they are going into crucial midterm elections. So I don't see any incentives there. It's certainly what the world is dealing with now is the fact that you've got such a resurgence dollar and what that means a lot of time today is just implementing very punitive borrowing costs and a domestic economy. I think the one really good example of this is the check central bank where they actually have significant effects reserves are able to credibly intervene. I think this is a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1393,2022-10-10 05:39:49
13168," The good example of this is the check central bank where they actually have, you know, significant effects reserves are able to credibly intervene. I think this is the lesson that we'll have to learn, you know, on forcey for the next crisis is that now, effects intervention is another arm of economic policy. You need to have those reserves in place to defend your domestic currency and to defend your economy against a resurgent dollar. So if they learn that lesson, what does it look like when this crisis is over? Are we going to see this mass building of reserves? I think that's definitely something that, you know, fiscal policy or central bank policy is going to have to look at. I think we've seen the check central bank come at very credibly, but you have to put in context they've got the second highest effects reserves to GDP, you know, across the EM, second only to Hong Kong that operates a fully-fledged currency pack. You know, I think we've seen central banks try, but, you know, you can kind of limit it at the silence, you can't change the direction. So maybe they can put off financial market participants by creating more volatility, but ultimately the direction is towards a higher dollar. So tell me this, what do you think happens next with the PBOC? China sets this stronger than expected Yuan fix for the 28th day in a row. Now, that is an incremental messaging without taking out a mallet. Do you think after we have this Congress this week that something much more prophetic happens in the Yuan? It's a really hardcore, I think, probably the best thing is, you know, if they kind of, we saw some kind of move away from COVID lockdown, we saw some kind of resumption of tourism, which would obviously, you know, recycle that significant current kind of surplus. And you see outflows from that extent. I'm fortunate, you know, I think it's an interesting world we live in, where even, you know, the PBOC, you know, the central bank of the second biggest economy in the world hasn't managed to kind of stabilize the currency and to move markets in the way that it's been directed. It shows that this is a global problem for emerging markets. And it's only, you know, very extreme hiking cycles. This is what we've seen from Brazil, or significant effects and dimensions, such as we've seen, from the Czech Republic, that are able to support your domestic currency. So basically, we need action not just to talk. Okay, we need them to walk the walk, Eimer, rather than just talk the talk, according to our chief economist, of course, he's talking about US rates, but it's sort of, it's multipurpose, isn't it? Eimer, thank you very much. Eimer Daily, emerging markets, macro strategist, at-net-west markets, I guess this morning. With Danny and I coming up, credit, Swiss frisky moves, the securedized products unit draws interest from two big names. We discuss who, what will you bid for SPG? What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale, isn't it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1394,2022-10-10 05:44:03
13169," It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. It's Dave Brayg here with me, Manus Cranny in Istanbul, Dany Berger holding a ship together at London HQ. So Credit Suisse, Danny, join the interest from the likes of Pimco and center of bridge partners for the Securitized Units products deal for this part of the business. It's a key pillar of the Swiss Landers plan to dine size the investment bank and get help pay for some of the restructuring. We got that news flow. You've got Choney there with you. Kick it off, Danny. Yeah, so Charlie Wells here. So Charlie first off, what's what's the appeal of this Securitized business? Yes, so this unit is really interesting, right? So they buy and sell securities that are backed by assets famously like mortgage loans, but also credit card debt, car loans as well. And when you look at Credit Suisse's business line here, by some measures, this unit has $75 billion in assets and it's profitable. Now the risk for some of these investors, of course, is that this is a very capital intensive type of business, but what it could do for the likes of Pimco for center bridge is to potentially give them access to some of these credit investments that they may be hungry for. So everybody's trying to get to see this morning. So we're focused on far sealed by Credit Suisse, you know, monster discount on assets that they've got to sell to dine scale the bank. Is that we're going to see here? Are we going to see a fire sale of these assets or is it going to be reasonable market value for reasonable, reasonable talent? Yeah, man, so that is a really good question. And I think what we do know is that it has been a terrible no good, very bad. I don't know, a couple months for Credit Suisse, of course, with their share price down so far. And we are expecting, you know, a very significant announcement later this month. And as you say, part of that strategy is potentially trying to instead of say issue new equity in order to raise money for what could be a potentially very expensive restructuring. The strategy is potentially selling off some of these assets in that investment banking, China cabinet. Now this seems like it could potentially be in line with that strategy and it could be a good business. Now what the price is going to be, I'm not sure, but what we do know is that there are willing buyers. We've been talking about this business unit. There was some interest also express last month by a number of investors. So this could be one that actually potentially strikes a good price. And, and of course, you know, as we've been mentoring, we have that restructuring. It's due on October 27th. We've had some hints of what's going to happen. We've had dead, dead buybacks. I mean, what sort of form? What do we know about the contours of what this will look like come October 27th? It's really difficult. And I think what we have seen in kind of management change after management change at Credit Suisse over the years has been a reluctance to downsize that investment bank. I think that is something that analysts have said needs to happen, but it is very difficult. And as I mentioned, it's incredibly expensive. So what we are expecting is changes to that investment bank. It sales like this are very much in line with that. But, you know, as I've said previously, October 27th is a long way away. Investors and analysts are really looking for something of an update. This potentially gives them a little bit, but how long that lasts? What we see with the share price over this coming week, I would be low to guess. I think I just picked on the movement on Friday. So it was 5.5% on the back of the debt buyback, the $3 billion debt buyback. Then the ADORs moved on our Bloomberg scoop, which was on these potential interest.

When you look at that concert Charlie, when you see that kind of response mechanism in the equity and the debt buyback, does that set up a much better concert to maybe then go and announce a big equity raising? I mean, that's really difficult, right? I think that could potentially be, you know, it could dilute the power of shareholders. I think shareholders would not be happy about that sort of move. And what's really striking here as well is credit suites in some ways seems to be following some of the moves from the Deutsche Bank Playbook back in those heydays of 2016, when of course they also bought back some debt. And that seemed to, you know, work at least in the medium term, but really didn't have that sort of, you know, long-term benefit that they may have been looking for. So I think, you know, Manus potentially working up to some of that, those equity sales that could be something that they would need to lay the groundwork for, but that will be very difficult work and they'd have to show, you know, a lot, a lot of prudence and a lot of diligence going forward there. Charlie, I also want to get into today's big take, which of course, if we can see that by going and I big take on the terminal. And it's about this idea that Goldman Sachs for so long has been trying to get a consumer unit, but they've been struggling, have a day. Right, so another big bank, another challenge, and really here, so for the better part is, say, a half decade, Goldman Sachs has been trying to crack that American consumer market. You know, we've seen executives at the bank say that they want to have Goldman Sachs seen by the American consumer as a quote, lovable teddy bear. We know that the CEO, David Solman, has actually tried to kind of woo the likes of, say, Reese Witherspoon into partnerships. If she wanted to offer some of her fans, financial services. But what the big take shows today is that big funnel that Goldman was trying to create of some of these gateway products for American consumers, things like checking accounts, things like Robo Advisory. Those are no longer going to be offered to that mass market. They're going to be focused more on wealth management clients that much smaller pool of customers. And why is this happening? I think it's really tough to crack the American consumer. It's incredibly expensive. The technology is really hard, and it's an incredibly competitive landscape. Yeah, and when we're not even reached with, Or Spoon, can see if you know you're in trouble. Carly, thank you so much. As always, as Charlie Wells, they're on the latest on credits, Reese, and a little bit of the big take for you. Now, coming up with Manus and me, and not so golden return, from the golden week holiday for Chinese investors, hoping you can lead us there. This is Bloomberg.さい. A digital first approach to the future work of the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Click the future work not be at home or in the office but in the metaverse instead. There's that word, metaverse. Good, well how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1396,2022-10-10 05:52:51
13171," It built on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Welcome back to Bloomberg day break here up. I'm Danny burger in London, Managed Kranie in Istanbul. Let's take a look at some of the key things that we're going to be watching out for this week. Today we have the ECB's Dovish Phillip Lane speaking. Tomorrow we're also going to get UK labor market data. Managed, then what do we got? Wednesday, PPI is hitting the tape. Thursday you're going to get the Ding Dong hot print CPI. What will the core do? 6.5% is expected. Ding Dong 75 basis for his Friday. We get UK home prices. I'm going to have to work forever and ever and ever. Chinese markets, they're trading lower. They've reopened after gold and weak the CSI near the lowest level since April 2020. Bleak consumption data, poor PBOC, employment data coming out as well. It's not looking good. Let's get to our equity reporter, N. Asia, Charlotte Yang. So, SinoUS, Anxed and the PBOC's labor indicators are screeching at the moment. It's not exactly a bullish start to the week, is it? Yeah, so no happy Monday for China stock traders who just re-enterned from their holiday and facing a slew of negative data. As we've mentioned, weak consumption data coming out from the Golden Week. Also, with global sell-off on Friday, as well as nothing, no improvement on the property side, as well as this big meeting coming up the Sunday. So, everyone is waiting to see and being very skeptical. And I feel like this is a question we keep asking, Charlotte, and perhaps it's a few trial questions to ask. But if we continue to see this weak consumer spending, is there going to be any change in the COVID-0 policy? Yeah, that's a question everyone really want answer from, is that if we're going to see like a clear change, where it's kind of zero COVID policy will go. At the moment, there's no clear signal of that, and that's something people are closely watching for the big meeting, the Sunday. People are getting conflicting signals with some Beijing Marathon news coming up that they're going to return. Some investors have got really excited, but then we're saying, COVID lockdown is a game, and COVID cases rising from the Golden Week holiday. So, at the moment, there are a bunch of conflicting signals, and nothing in particular, clearly, that's pointing out where the COVID policy is going. So, let's talk about the upcoming Congress of course, he's going to wave the banner of a zero COVID policy as having been something to applaud the rest of the world. Of course, it may have a different perspective. So, from a policy point of view, are we going to see a pivot to prioritizing reopening? Yeah, so, there are several things that investors are watching for the community. For us and foremost, what is going to be the top leadership position, and whether there will be a clear signals showing that more pro, what we're going to see, more pro-market policies, coming out of the meeting, and then also people are watching very closely for the stimulus policy to see if there is a clear signal pointing to any stimulus policies for the poverty sector or to boost the economy from the broader perspective. Okay, Charlotte, thank you very much. That's our Asia Equities reporter, Charlotte Yang. Amanda, we're just at the start of an IMF meeting in Washington where we're going to have global financial chiefs gathering there. I do wonder if they're going to feel the pressure. If the U.S. is going to feel a pressure of a world that is struggling with a stronger dollar and continues to have to intervene, I know you got the chart on central bank drawdowns in this Treasury market. Yeah, and this is something that Valerie and Taitel put together for us this morning. There's a wonderful phrase in Irish, and it's called Mayfeng, me and myself first. So very much the dollar and the Fed. It's all about them. Now look, what you're looking at here, Danny, is the rate of drawdown in this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1397,2022-10-10 05:57:11
13172," a self-first. So very much the dollar and the Fed. It's all about them. Now look what you're looking at here, Danny, is the rate of drawdown, the sales by Central Banks in terms of bonds. You're looking to treasure it, it flows the fastest since March 2020 and it is the Asia and indeed emerging markets where we've seen the biggest drawdown. What? Japan, 20 billion. South Korea, I think Valerie put it in here, 20 billion, the second biggest monthly drawup on record. Look, it's a self-fulfilling doom look, but I guess this morning said no. He said that this is not an implosion to come in the bond markets. We're near the end of the drop. Danny. Yeah, but however, our guest on EM was saying to us, Ms. Daily, that we're going to face an issue because of the need for intervention that it's clear monetary policy just hiking isn't enough. You're going to have to have Central Banks who continue to jump in to defend their currency. We've seen it in Japan, we've seen it in South Korea, we've seen the BOE have to intervene as well. So Danny, would you like a little bit of convexity for the week? That's the question that you need to ask yourself. There's a monster, a little bit of a little bit convexity. There's somebody out there who's spent a million bucks go on my son, my daughter. You spent a million bucks betting that the VIX is going to explode to 150. That is twice the pandemic high, twice. Have a look at this, Valerie, run it now. I don't have vision, but you can tell me whether it's there. This is the CBOE, CBOE SKU, the tail risk for equity protection, the lowest is 2020 and the Credit Suisse Fier of Barometer, the lowest since 2008. It's staggering. It could be the best million dollars anybody ever spent. Danny. Man, it's your flying blind, but you would never know just as you speak at the chart comes up, the power of TV magic. But, man, it's for what is worth. You want to see the mess that's actually under here, you read. You're much more tidy than I am, man. But, man, it's for what it's worth that 150 bet it could just be a hedge, maybe it's someone bush, you know, and just once a little hedge there in case we do see an explosion higher, which I hope we don't again, man, as my nerves can't take it. For every bit there's an offer, somebody who bought the option means somebody wrote the premium and took in the premium. We'll leave it there. More from Istanbul, tomorrow and London on Daybreak, Europe. Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPadOS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar macOS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud Photo Library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features down to cross iPadOS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager in iPadOS 16 is still quite buggy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1398,2022-10-10 06:01:24

I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the App Store. The feature clearly needs some more polish. And complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

We did see suppression in the U.N., we did see suppression of futures. That is now being reversed. MUSIC Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market, Europe. I'm Anna Edwards live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away. Here are your top headlines. Broad based bearishness, Asian stocks and futures. Kick off the week on the back foot after strong US jobs, a solidified bets on jumbo rate hikes from the Fed. Golden week tarnished Chinese markets reopen in the red, weighed down by concerns over global interest rates, COVID and fresh US curves on tech. Plus, Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of carrying out Saturday's attack on a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea. Welcome to the program. Everybody, just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading for this Monday morning for another week. And let's have a look at the future's picture and remind ourselves of the negativity we were dealing with on Friday. Of course, we got that stronger than some anticipated jobs report on Friday. That led to much higher expectation of where the Fed goes in terms of interest rates or solidified those expectations. Perhaps there were already in place. And so European stocks did drop by 1.6%. But US stocks dropped by more than 2% in the case of Dow and S&P, more than 3% in the case of the Nasdaq. So perhaps Europe has some catching up to do. European futures then cooled down by 1.2% as you see there for Euro stocks 50 futures. US futures, though, also suggesting some weakness, but not by quite as much down by 1.5% on E-minis and on Nasdaq futures. Let's have a look at what's going on on the GMN payrolls. Of course, then clearly the big guiding data point, I suppose, for global assets at this point. But the Asian expression of that coming through very strongly this morning, the Chinese markets back in play. Japanese markets are close today. But Chinese markets are back, as we mentioned in our headlines, concerns around chip regulation over in the United States, concerns around COVID and COVID policy and the broad state of growth really in China. In FX markets, it's interesting. We're pretty risk off then, generally speaking, across the equity space globally. But the dollar is not that strong. It is up by a tenth of a percent, but no bigger moves than that this morning. But FX markets, you can see negativity elsewhere. And that's what we have. In terms of the commodity space, we have some commodities moving to the upside as you can see. Let us linger on the thinking behind the data that we saw on Friday and how that sets us up for the data and things to happen this week. US hiring continued at a solid, but more moderate pace last month and the unemployment rate fell, meaning the labor market remains tight and has so far proven resilience of the Fed's rate hikes, boom, like TV guests, way in on the latest data and its implications for policy. It came in right under the nose in line with expectations. It's solid. Good news for those in the soft landing or the moderation camp. It's a little bit disappointing to the to the dovish camp. The labor market is slowing, but is really not weakening little bit reinforcing to the hawkish camp. We saw uniformly from from Fred President talking about a continued hawkish narrative and this just be then to that. It's still an exceptionally strong labor market and herein lies the challenge for the Fed. What's all about the Fed? It's got to keep going. It's going to keep the Fed on track for 75 basis point move at the next meeting. Think you get a 75, you'll probably go another 50. We get divided another 25. The Fed's going to keep at it. There's nothing in this this report that is going to suggest to them that they need to pull back. It's price to get really tight and the markets are reacting to that. Joining us now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1399,2022-10-10 06:06:00
13174," So then that they need to pull back. It's price to get really tight and the markets are reacting to that. Joining us now, let's stick with this theme of what's going on with broad global interest rates and interest rate policy globally. As a result of some of the strength of the data we've seen out of the US recently, Roger Lee joins us head of UK Equity Strategy at Investek. Roger, very good morning to you. We will certainly get to the UK. We've had some headlines for the Bank of England this morning. We'll get to the UK conversation. But let's set that up first with a reflection on what's going on globally. We've seen of course the jobs report looking pretty strong, reinforcing expectations of more jumbo hikes to come. Is that your expectation? And how sure are we that four and a half percent is the end point here? Well, good morning and thank you for having me. Well, we're not and that's the problem with those jobs numbers on Friday. Where does the Fed have to stop in order to slow this economy? In order to get the employment rate down to some sort of equilibrium as Chair Powell has referred to it. The curve is sort of looking for between four and a half percent by the end of this year. That's sort of in line with our own views, probably to the lower end of that. But I think what the market is now beginning to realise is that any thought of a rate cut next year is looking very, very optimistic indeed. And it's that repricing. It's that repricing further into 2023 that I think is causing the stress in markets. So if you divine expectations of a pivot as expecting cuts to follow, then you'll be disappointed in 23 in your view because we just won't get cuts. Absolutely. And I think, you know, I don't know how many billions of dollars have been lost on this pivot narrative over the summer. But it is looking just, I don't think you need to be an economist to see that the Fed is unlikely to be cutting rates anytime soon. In fact, if anything, clearly there must be risk to the upside. And the idea then that the Fed gets to four, four and a half percent at the end of the year and then just holds and watches the data, that would seem to be the most benign outcome at the moment. And it's not unusual for the Fed to sit and hold for a period of time. They did it in 2000s and they did it at the end of the 90s. So I think that raise and hold is probably what the market is going to have to start pricing. Okay, but there is a risk that we don't raise and hold, but we keep on raising further than four, four and a half. Because at the moment that seems to be a sort of landing ground that the Fed has sketched out. But it is no more than that is it, it's sort of a talking point, but it's not a commitment. Well, it's sort of where their dot plot was signifying. So, I mean, I guess there's a bit more to it than that. So if they, yeah, the next time they published their rate forecast through the dot plot, and it's higher than that endpoint, then that's going to put further strain on the market. So I think you've generally speaking got this environment at the moment where, you know, we just have no certainty about, as you say, we have no certainty about where that landing point is. And that is, it was the realisation on Friday as it has been on all the down days we've had really over the last six or nine months. Mohammed Ali Alihan who writes a Bloomberg opinion also advises Alihan's, he was saying over the weekend, there's a very high risk of a damaging recession now in the United States. Do we go that far? I did the survey at risk. I mean, it would be impossible to dispute that. I mean, there must be a risk. I mean, if you're suddenly raising rates, if they have to raise rates higher than, you know, that four and a half percent endpoint things, things look very, very tricky indeed. You know, the chances of a soft landing are receding, each of these stronger data points that come out. You know, this idea that sort of good news is bad news and bad news is good news. And at the moment, any good news around the economy is bad news for markets, because it just gives further weight, further risk that that rate cycle is going to end up a lot hard on the markets anticipating. And that pivot narrative quite frankly becomes largely irrelevant. Okay, Roger, stay with us. We'll get to the UK conversation shortly. Roger Lee, head of UK Equity Strategy at Invest Tech. And speaking of the UK, we've had some lines coming out from the Bank of England this morning. Remember that the activity to support the guilt markets is supposed to come to an end on Friday. They're saying they are adding measures to support market functioning. They stand ready to increase the size of their daily auctions. They've added measures to support orderly end of the buy scheme. And that orderly end then is still expected on at the end of this week. They are announcing measures for a final week of temporary operations. That's how they're dumping this. So that doesn't sound like a Bank of England that's looking to extend.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1400,2022-10-10 06:10:54
13175," the end of this week. They are announcing measures for a final week of temporary operations. That's how they're dubbing this. So that doesn't sound like a bank of England that's looking to extend. We'll get more just thoughts in the next part of the conversation. We'll talk about how the UK market is functioning. We have seen the long end of the Gilt curve just starting to tick up and test what the bank of England is doing here. And we'll talk about where this leaves us for the start of next week. So that's the UK story. Back to that in a moment. We'll get to a Bloomberg first-where news update now though. Top stories we're covering here at Bloomberg. His Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning Anna. Russian President Vladimir Putin is blaming Ukraine for the attack that badly damaged a key bridge linking annex Crimea to Russia. In his first comments on the attack, Putin blamed the Ukrainian Secret Service, alleging they had helped from an unnamed foreign states. Kiev has not officially claimed responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new postage stamp. China is stepping up efforts to contain COVID outbreaks ahead of the party congress. Nearly 1900 cases were reported yesterday, the highest level in almost two months, fueling concerns about widening lockdowns rippling across the financial hub of Shanghai. Meanwhile, PMI data showed China's services activity contracted in September for the first time in four months as lockdowns dampened consumer spending. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and to act responsibly after a refinery strike left petrol stations with no fuel in some regions. The Transport Minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Chinese chip stocks have slumped after fresh US restrictions on access to technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticized the curbs as unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of US companies. Recent American measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance military capabilities. Global news, 20 per hour a day. On air, on Bloomberg, quick take, far more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Alice, thanks very much. Alice Ankins here in London. Coming up on the program, China's President Xi is expected to trumpet the country's zero COVID policy at a once in five-year party congress. The question now is how long can that policy continue? Plus, David Solomon, once predicted Goldman, would be a leader in retail banking. The Lenders CEO is now ditching his dream of consumer domination. We'll have the details on the scaling back of their ambitions in that particular sector. That's today's big take story. Up next, we'll focus on the UK. We've heard from the Bank of England this morning, we'll talk politics as well. This trust is preparing for battle with conservative party colleagues.

Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at the stage. We have to be able to give our customers vehicles, you know, that are their primary vehicles that are EVs and to be able to do that we need to have range and infrastructure and we need to remove the pain points and so that's what we're doing. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe 45 or so minutes to go until the start of cash equity trading for another week here in Europe and the future's picture looks pretty gloomy. Catching up really with the US and the significant losses we saw by the end of the day on Wall Street as a result of that strong labor report which of course reinforces bets on Fed Heights. Let's get to the UK story though. Britain's finance minister Quasit Quasit saying travels to Washington this week for the IMF's annual meetings with relations precarious. We're calling a time the UK begged for a bailout from the IMF in 1976. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Liz Tras is preparing to quash any attempts at rebellion within the Conservative Party little more than a month into her premiership. She'll directly address MPs in a meeting later on this week. Let's talk about how all of this adds up to a UK strategy. Roger Lee is still with us head of UK equity strategy at Invest Tech and just to focus on what the government is doing here and the government's role in all of this. A lot of focus obviously on the negative fallout in markets and that's rightly where a lot of people have focused but you point to the reasons to tackle the underlying low growth environment in the UK. How does that play into your strategy for UK assets? Well, the UK along with most Western economies has experienced certainly pre-pandemic extremely low levels of real growth. I mean real growth in the UK has been around one and a half percent for the last decade. nominal growth with inflation hasn't been much higher because inflation has been so low. So this very low growth environment, I say not just in the UK but in Europe and in the US as well, has led to two probably most important factors. One, it's led to significant asset price inflation. So if you are an asset owner then the last 10 years has been very satisfactory. However, if you're a wage earner and you haven't seen your wages go up in the last 10 years, then the recent past hasn't been quite as attractive. And I think it's trying to address that very low levels of real growth we've seen in the economy. And you know, question is clearly whether this works or not. I mean obviously there's a huge amount of skepticism. But I think to an extent there is a sort of a need in society for higher levels of growth, not just here but across the Western world. Yeah and it's just a question of how you can deliver that at a time when the market is really focused on inflation and that seems to where issues have come to the fore. The Bank of England then had to step in to shore up the guilt markets because of the functioning in the pensions market essentially. Interesting we've heard from the Bank of England today saying they will cease all bond purchasing on October the 14th as this temporary intervention that was announced on September 28th comes to an end. They are prepared to increase this week the size of those auctions they're doing. I just wonder how this package can just come to an end on Friday in a in a calm fashion. We also what was happening to guilt markets in the interim is this all about how pensions will have been preparing themselves in this interim period for what's going to happen otherwise we could face a time when long-end guilt yields just go back to rising again. Yes and there's obviously a risk to the guilt market in this. It would appear that the Bank of England's very timely and decisive action what 10 days ago has steadied the pension fund market and generally speaking you get these moments of crisis when you have very fast markets very rapid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1402,2022-10-10 06:18:50
13177," music There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, in not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to nexzero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion. They can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Europe 40 minutes until the start of cash equity trading futures points lower. As most of the world moves on from COVID-19, President Xi Jinping is set to trump it, his strict measures to control the virus when he addresses the party congress in Beijing this week. The national case count has climbed to the highest in almost two months. The concerns about widening lockdowns are rippling across the financial hub of Shanghai for more which joined by Dante and Kate. I'm managing editor for Asia governments in Hong Kong. Daniel, good to see you. So how long can China's strict curbs on around COVID last? Well, that's certainly the big question. And nobody really knows for sure. It's very hard to tell what public opinion is in China. We've broadly seen support for these measures over the months and years since the pandemic first emerged. But now there's certain signs that that support is cracking. And we see that on social media, more and more complaints coming through about mass testing in particular. The quarantines that exist, the lockdowns that are going on. Just today we had the People's Daily, which is a Communist Party's mouthpiece, urging people to have confidence in COVID-19 and be more patient, which suggests, of course, that they're growing more or less patient, I should say, with the policy. So there's an awareness that something needs to be done. The problem they face, though, is that the elderly vaccination rate is still not at levels seen in other countries. So in a country of 1.3 billion, even in an Omicron wave, could essentially kill more than a million people. Right. Yes. So, it's lagging the point you make there about elderly vaccination rates, also a lack of facilities and treatment pills. Now, China, this is all in the build-up to China holding its once every five-year party Congress. That takes place later this week. What is the state of the party, then, as we head towards that? Well, certainly they're going to portray, or Xi Jinping will portray, on Sunday, a very strong China, confident China. Under the surface, though, there's a lot of question marks that are going on, particularly how they get out of this COVID-zero situation, given the pressures that are, the economy is facing right now. Unemployment going up, clearly it's not on a very sustainable path right now.

So a lot of questions about the direction of policy going forward in China, even as she will certainly portray China to be doing very well. As well as pressure from within, China has accused Biden's president Biden's new chip technology curves of harming its economic recovery. And we've seen a step up in those curves just in recent days. How severe is that below then for China? Yeah, this is effectively the United States trying to, you know, just prevent any chips from getting in, particularly on AI and super computing. So, you know, the US is leaning on all countries that might provide this kind of technology to China. So over the long term, this is China's ambition to become self-sufficient in these areas, but they've really struggled to develop their own technology in the space. So, you know, over the long term, certainly that'll do a blow to China's ambitions to dominate these types of industries, you know, particularly as the US is taking a much more targeted approach. Thanks so much, Dan. Thanks very much for joining us, Daniel Tenkator, managing editor for Asia Governments in Hong Kong. Coming up on the program, we'll talk financial services, PIMCO, are among a short list of bidders for a piece of credit-sweeces, securitised products, business. We'll get that story. We'll also return to our big take story today, Goldman Sachs, and their scaled-back ambitions around retail banking. That was a post-global financial crisis development, wasn't it? The push by Goldman Sachs into that space. How much are they dialing back those expectations? We'll talk about that too. This is Blaineback. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. Layed on the surface of a reservoir, they can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. And this one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea still relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1405,2022-10-10 06:32:39
13179," your goals. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. We still have half an hour until the start of cash equity trading for this Monday. Here are your top stories. Broad base bearishness, Asian stocks and futures, kick off the week on the back first after strong US job status, solidified bets on jumbo rate hikes and the Fed. Golden week tarnished Chinese markets reopen in the red, waged down by concerns over global interest rates, COVID and fresh US curbs on Chinese tech. Plus, Vladimir Putin accuses Ukraine of carrying out Saturday's attack on a key bridge linking Russia to Crimea. Welcome back to the program. The future's picture then for European equity markets looks to be pretty negative because we've got a bit of catching up to do with what happened over in the United States. US equity markets were weaker, we saw that jobs report, which in some cases was painting a picture of a stronger labor market than the markets had anticipated. And so as a result of that, markets then reprised just how much conviction they had around what the Fed was going to do and how many jumbo hikes we were going to get from the Fed. So all of that adds up to bearishness for risk assets. We saw that extensively on Friday and we need to be surprised in a bit more of that for Europe. It would seem so European features are weaker US features also down by between 4 and 5 tenths of a percent though. So that's also worth keeping in mind. Let us focus in on what's happening with central bank policy then central banks around the world are swapping their stockpiles of US treasuries for cash as they look to battle a strong dollar. Our market set at a Valerie tight sale is here with an interesting chart on this front. Valerie some treasuries data then has caught your eye because it really tells us how much these global central banks are relying on their holdings of treasuries to get hold of dollars that they need to support their currencies. Yes, exactly Anna and I've got a chart here for you. It's showing the five week or so like that the monthly net drawdown of central banks and the last month we've seen a nearly 80 billion drop in the treasury holdings of these central banks. Now we know a lot of that is coming from Asia. We had to pan spend 20 billion dollars in just one day and we're going to have a big impact on the next market. We've seen South Korea which I'm going to talk about a bit later. Their effects reserves drop by 20 billion last month. But just to put this into perspective, that is the biggest drop we've seen since March 2020, which we all know clearly what was going on then. Huge stress in the market as the world was really waking up to what COVID a COVID shutdown would mean. And you've got some specifics then around Korea, you mentioned that you can help us illustrate what it is that central banks globally are up to. Yes, exactly. In my next chart, I'm drawing down into South Korea. Now the South Korea business model, as you can say, is coming under a lot of stress from a lot of sides. They're normally dependent on cheap energy imports so they can export technological goods. Obviously with the war in Ukraine, the energy price escalation, your to date, their current account is now in a deficit because they're having to pay a huge amount for their energy imports. At the same time, they export technological goods, notably semiconductors, which are also the demand for those is also declining. So in September alone, the Bank of Korea spent 20 billion dollars to stem the slide in its currency. Now within that same month, the currency dropped by 7%, which is still the biggest drop almost in 11 years. So the firepower that Korea is throwing into the FX market really isn't doing a lot. Now if we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1406,2022-10-10 06:36:55

13181," percent which is still the biggest drop almost in 11 years. So the firepower that Korea is throwing into the FX market really isn't doing a lot. Now if we look at Korea though there's a lot of parallels to what they're dealing with to what an economy like Germany is dealing with for example. They rely on cheap energy imports to fuel their export engine and a lot of this is going to come under increasing strains as we see things like OPEC cutting their supply and you know the labor data last week on Friday clearly didn't show any cracks in the labor market the Fed is still on attack. So these countries business models you can say are going to come under increasing strains if those narratives don't turn around and it doesn't look like that's going to happen anytime soon. Okay, Valerie thanks very much Valerie Tainsel with the latest on treasury holdings the strong dollar the impact is having on central bank globally what they are doing about it. Let's get a Bloomberg business flash. The top corporate story is recovering today is Alice. Hi Anna, Renault has said to be open to cutting its stake in Nissan. Sources say the two companies are ramping up talks over the French car makers plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets due in early November. We're told Nissan is pressing Renault to reduce its stake from over 40% to 15% which would bring it level with its own holding. Chinese chip stocks have slumped after fresh US restrictions on access to technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticised the curbs as unfair and said they will also hurt the interests of US companies. Recent American measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance military capabilities. Chinese food delivery giant Mettuan is said to be considering expanding its international markets as domestic growth slows. Bloomberg understands the company will first attempt to break into the Hong Kong market. The plans are still at a preliminary stage. That's your Bloomberg business flash Anna. Alice, thanks very much. Alice, I can't hear in London. Let's talk about the banking sector. Credit Suisse has drawn the interest from the likes of or drawn interest from the likes of PIMCO and Centrebridge partners for its secure products units. A deal for this part of the business is a key pillar of the Swiss Lenders plan to downsize its investment bank and would help pay for restructuring. Let's get to my colleague, Bluebest Charlie Wells, who has all the details on this story and others from the sector at Charlie Good Morning. So it was the appeal of the secure-atized product business that we're talking about here. Yeah, so this is a business unit that buys and sells securities backed by assets like mortgages very famously but also credit card debt, car loans. What's really striking about Credit Suisse's business here is that it by some measures has $75 billion in assets and it's profitable. Now the risk with this type of secure-atized business is that it involves a lot of capital but what these investors may be drawn to is the fact that it could give them exposure to some of these credit investments that they're hungry for. Okay, yes and it's capital intensive businesses that have been part of the focus that's credit suisse when it comes to restructuring. So what does this tell us about the much-awaited restructuring at Credit Suisse and what that's going to look like? So October 27th is the day that the market really is waiting for. That is when we're supposed to get an update on what we were expecting to be a major shake-up at the bank. Now what analysts have been expecting for a long time is potentially a shrinking of that investment bank and this is very much in line with that strategy, right? The share price of Credit Suisse has been down so far. They know that they need to make changes. Some estimates put the capital required for those changes at $4 billion and so selling off some of these China assets in its China cabinet could potentially raise some of that money to make these changes. Okay, so we'll focus on that October 27th, you said that's the date to watch out for. Also in the banking sector, we have today a big-take story out of Goldman Sachs and this is a really fascinating story and one with a bit of history isn't it because they had retail banking ambitions. I mean, they still have retail banking ambitions, but they're scaling them back. That's the point of the story. I remember when that was part of the post-financial crisis pivot from Goldman Sachs to get more of those deposits that they could then rely on in tough times. Yeah, it was a diversification play. It was also sort of an image play, right? So an executive at Goldman said at one point, he wanted American consumers to think about Goldman as a quote lovable teddy bear. We know that David. A lot of vampires quit. Certainly not of vampires. We know that David Solomon at one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1407,2022-10-10 06:40:36
13182," David Goldman said at one point he wanted American consumers to think about Goldman as a quote lovable teddy bear. We know that David. A lot of vampire squids. Certainly not a vampire squids. We know that David Solomon at one point as this story shows got on a plane to try to come up with some sort of partnership with celebrity Reese Witherspoon who was thinking about offering financial services. But what we've seen is this funnel that Goldman tried to create to get in a lot of American consumers is shrinking. So it was checking accounts. It was Robo advisory services that were supposed to be offered across the board. What our reporting shows today is that those are going to be offered to a limited set of customers in that wealth management client. Okay. Charlie, thanks very much. Thanks for the update. Charlie Wells on credit suites, the latest there. And also our big take story on Goldman Sachs. We want to find out more about that story. And I big take is the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal. Or you can find it on our website coming up. Putin blames Ukraine for the blast. That's going to be a big thing. Tomorrow Bloomberg has the biggest names in business. First from the Greenwich Economic Forum in Connecticut, a global perspective and alternative investments with influencers from politics and finance. Then Bloomberg invest New York where industry leaders discuss the challenges and opportunities in today's changing economic landscape. The fourth perry ever begins tomorrow on Bloomberg, your global business authority. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. We need to continue to bring down the flashery pressures that people have. Certainly what OPEC made a decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The President was just disappointed with his administration but we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean I think that I had a long conversation in office today. I certainly don't want to see the unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. That's what the Fed is forecasting. Some people say that's the objective. How are you preparing for the pain that they're forecasting? And what can we do on the supply side when it comes to things like immigration? Well on the unemployment, we've been talking for the last three months about seeing those numbers go down and in the year 2022 we've had about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month I should say the last month. We're still seeing those numbers.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1408,2022-10-10 06:44:33
13183," 22 with about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month, I should say, the last month, we're still seeing those numbers going on. So I think that that's something that is important that we continue to put those gains. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously, we'd like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean, that number went down a little bit this month. I think one-tenth of a percent. So we're going to, we have to see what's happening there. Clearly, the employee over the last couple of years is getting some leverage. It hasn't had for a few years. A number of years, maybe even decades over their employers. You broke into deal with unions in the last few months with freight rail companies, the 12 unions. I understand four of them have ratified the deal, Marty. Secondly, Welsh, are you worried about the other rate? No, I'm not. I mean, they're out there explaining, when I say they, the union leadership now and the bargaining committees are out there explaining to the members what's in those contracts. It was a very painful negotiation, not what I had, but prep leading up to me. Two years of negotiation with really no movement. And I think that there's explaining to do when these contracts, and I look at these contracts, they're a good contract. I mean, it's 24% over five years. Healthcare, freeze cap, work rules change. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully, we can get the rest of these ratified in the next six weeks. In the Rose Garden, the president said this, because of this labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their healthcare by cap and across the workers will have to pay. Have the poor workers on the West Coast Secretary Walsh asked for the same conditions? No, I mean, I don't know. I didn't get in, I don't know what they're asking for for wages and benefits, but certainly, those are all the conversations that are generally on the table. A little different negotiation. The West Coast Port negotiation is a very fluid conversation that the both sides are at the table. They're both having conversations. It's a longer process than I anticipate but that's just historically the way they've operated. They kind of take one segment at a time. I stay in close contact with both the employer side in the unions on the West Coast Port. And both sides express to me that they're still moving forward. They'll obviously be sticky issues that will pop up every now and then, but nothing that's making me be concerned that I have to have a 20-hour meeting in my office about. There's the Labor Secretary, Marty Wolff, speaking with Greenberg's Jonathan Farrow. On Friday, after the jobs report, it's important to keep across that conversation, of course, as the strength of that Labor market still a real crucial data point for the markets of watches. We work our way towards inflation numbers later this week. Now, let's unpack the busy week ahead, thinking about what is to come. Today's one for Central Bank Whispers, as we hear the Fed's Lail Braynard and Charles Evans speaking at the NABE annual meeting in Chicago, plus the ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, will speak at the European Central Bank's conference on monetary policies. A plenty of Central Bank speak today. Tomorrow, we'll get the UK jobs data, as well as the IMF's Outlook and Financial Stability reports, the UK Lail Braynard market also has been very strong, very tight, of course, which has been one of the problems, of course, with the growth agenda recently. And now, more data from the UK on Wednesday will paint a picture of growth in the last quarter, adding to that is mortgage application data out of the US. A crucial focus on the state of the housing market in the US's rates rise. Thursday is the big one with US CPI data due, it will be key to the Fed's plans going ahead in the current monetary tightening cycle. G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors are meeting in Washington. Of course, will there be much talk about the strength of the dollar there, currency and the world's problems it seems to be? Friday, we'll see key data from China ahead of the party congress this weekend. Plus, we'll have a clear picture on American finances, JP Morgan Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley report. On third quarter, we are back to earning season already. That has come around fast. Let us turn it from the earning stories to geopolitics. And Central Kiev has been hit by explosions two days after an attack on a key bridge. The links to Crimea that President, the Russian President Vladimir Putin, blamed on Ukraine. Kiev's mayor says several blasts were reported in the city's central district. This as air raid alerts were activated across Ukraine earlier this morning. For more, we're joined now by Bloomberg senior reporter for International Affairs, Mark Champion. Mark, very good to speak to you. We're going to come to the broader picture in a moment, but just a moment on what we're hearing this morning about WhatsApp.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1409,2022-10-10 06:49:22
13184," joined now by Bloomberg senior reporter for International Affairs Mark Champion. Mark, very good to speak to you. We're going to come to the broader picture in a moment, but just a moment on what we're hearing this morning about what's happening in Kiev. How unusual is it to see that level of attack on Kiev at this point? I mean, clearly it was very much under attack at the start of the war, but how has that progressed? Yeah, it's been months since we saw anything like this. And what is very particular about this set of attacks is that they are clearly on civilian targets. There's no a little while ago there was a strike in central Kiev, but you know, it was obvious there that although they hit apartment buildings, the actual target was an industrial military industrial factory behind the apartments. In this case, these are simply they're hitting a central park, university park in the middle of town. You know, the equivalent in the UK would be hitting high park, hitting is a major university in the middle of the city. And there's some reports also of hitting as a monument to one of Ukraine's independence heroes. So these are different in kind. Okay, different in kind. Let's think about the broader picture and what happens next in Russia, then, Mark? What can we expect today from a meeting that's set to take place? He's President Putin has called a meeting with his security council. Yes. So in a sense, you know, what happened, of course, on Saturday there was an explosion on the bridge and Putin built between the Russian mainland and Crimea after you annex Crimea in 2014. So huge project, very personal and the Ukrainians hit it on Saturday or it seems that the Ukrainians have hit it. Putin has accused them of doing so. The Ukrainians immediately came out with a new postage stamp, you know, in an honor of the blast. So these attacks, which were actually across the country last night, and they started over the weekend in a major city called separation in the southeast. These attacks are clearly in retaliation. He is now called a security council meeting. So that may just be the beginning of his response. It was a, it will be seen by Putin as a personal attack on him, symbolic life a week in him. Yes, indeed. I mean, Ukraine, you've made the point before that Ukraine has attacked arms depots, transport into infrastructure in Russia itself. This, as you point out, this bridge had a great deal of symbolism for Russia and therefore could have been seen as a target by the Ukrainians, although important to say they haven't actually claimed it yet, have they marked. But why is this bridge so significant? Well, I mean, it does have a strategic significance because this is the main way in which the armed forces in the south for Russia are supplied. So the supplies come across the bridge into Crimea, which has become a major naval basis, all that sort of thing. It is at the moment also possible to get there by road. They can resupply it by road across the mainland now because they hold those areas. They've taken them since February. But the bridge was key. And if the bridge is lost, and that connection is broken, then the road becomes the only way to supply Crimea. And that road, there are parts of it, which are already within range of Ukrainian high-mass missiles. Okay, Mark, thanks so much for the update. Bimbe senior reporter for International Affairs, Mark Champion. Coming up on the program, we'll get back to stocks in focus.

We still have seven minutes to go until the start of cash equities trading. Let's get a focus on the stocks that we're watching today. Tom McKenzie joins us, anchor of the European market, open, Tom Good morning to you. So you're watching a range of sectors and giving the car space. Yeah, there's one company that stands out within the auto sector, which is Renault. And of course, it's two decade, it is now two decade old coalition with Nissan. And there is now a report from Bloomberg that Renault is prepared potentially to reduce its stake in Nissan. This is something that Nissan has long pushed for. They have about a 43% stake. Nissan wants to get down to 15%. Whether they get that low remains in question. But certainly Renault is preparing this. They want to have the funds to rework this coalition. And also focus on the shift to EVs. It's going to come down to some extent to the French state as well, which has a 15% stake in Renault. We also hear that Nissan may be prepared, maybe looking to raise additional funds to purchase those shares from Renault. So we continue to that watch that stock at the reaction on the back of that news. They could be prepared to reduce their stake in Nissan. Okay, well, watch that. And that the complexity around the relationship there. Let's talk about semi-conductor manufacturing and the equipment used to do that. ASMR. Yeah, absolutely central, of course, to the chip space is this Dutch company that produces these incredible computers and machines that produce, of course, semi-conductors. This is on the back of the reporting and the stories around what happened on Friday, in fact, from the Biden administration, just further restricting the access of chips, but also chip making equipment further restrictions there in terms of that supply to China. The focus is on AI chips, the supercomputer chips, but also further restrictions, again, on the producers of some of these very high-spec machines. So that's why we're focused on ASMR this morning on the back of those further restrictions from the US and on Friday. And also focus on UK utilities. There's been a lot of conversation around Europe about where we're going to see windfall taxes fall on energy companies and some countries have gone more down that route that UK charting an interesting course here. Yeah, this is the administration of Liz Trass, at least her and her team, pushing pretty aggressively to get in place a plan, according to the Financial Times, to put a cap on wholesale renewable energy prices. We call that SSE as one example of a company that could move on the back of this. So it would be looking at long-term contracts, but you point to that windfall tax analyst who's saying this is still a risk. Liz Trass in her campaign for the leadership of the party and, of course, the country pushed back and said she didn't want to see a windfall tax analyst.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1411,2022-10-10 06:57:46
13186," You point to that Winfold tax analyst saying this is still a risk. Liz Truss in her campaign for the leadership of the party and of course the country pushed back and said she didn't want to see a Winfold tax. And it's saying that UK could be forced into that position given the fiscal constraints there facing of course that would be an impact of course across the U.S. to this face. But in this case it's about those plans around the renewable energy cap. OK, so Scottish and Southern in focus other businesses in that space, Scottish power of course EDF and RWE European businesses that could be impacted. Tom McKenzie thank you very much. The European market open is up next. This is Blaineback. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love is good. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today?

13187," Just in the last few minutes you have had reports of explosions in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and we'll keep across that story for you Let's take a look at the futures then pointing lower by 1.2% after the bloodletting towards the end of the week the volatility in these markets Of course focused on these data points at the beginning of the week the expectation that maybe you'd start to get a pivot from central banks That was put to one side when you saw the strength once again of the US jobs market an unemployment rate back to a level Record level of 3.5% and again baking in 75 basis points. That is the consensus view of the Fed come November The Spanish Ibex currently down 6.10 of 8% here in the UK the FTSE 100 down 28 points is the B.O.E. steps in Again just a few minutes ago saying they will continue to provide liquidity within the guilt market as they look to the end of those operations On October the 14th over in France, you're looking at losses now of more than 1% Let's switch it over and see how things are looking on a big week as well for earnings you've got the big banks States side JP Morgan Morgan Stanley City black rock as well the money manager of course coming out of the earnings And a view as well that Apple is going to be consequential in terms of the earnings picture there in trying to filling out the expectations around growth A demand and supply chains and of course the question around inflation future states I'm looking to further losses of 6.10 of 8% of course after the very heavy selling we saw on Friday again on the back of that jobs report The pound at 1.10 just down a 10th of 8% and the two year here in the UK full 15 again Continued to much the guilt space on the back of the action from the B.O.E. trying to calm these markets again saying they will step in With additional liquidity if and when needed 97 dollars about on Brent coming off by 3.10% after of course that Debt cut in production from opic the concerns once again back on the growth picture when it comes to the all story Now stocks are lower this morning as investors worry about rising interest rates That's after a strong US jobs report as I mentioned reaffirming those bets of a jumbo Fed Hike in November Alleyons chief economic advisor Muhammad L.A. and said the US economy is on a bumpy journey to a better Destination but the risk of recession persists Not only does it have to overcome inflation but it has to restore its credibility So yes I fear that we risk a very high probability of a damaging recession that was totally avoidable Okay, that was of course Muhammad L.A. informally of PIMCO Joining us now for more is Sharon Bell Goldman Sachs co-head of a mere investment research Sharon, let's just get your views then on the tightness in this job market What it means for the Fed going forward? The M live question of the day is haven't how many more 75 basis point jumbo hikes Can we now expect from the Fed? Is 75 baked in for you from November and do we get more in December as well? Yeah, I think we get 75 in November I think we get more in December and probably another high car after that early next year So I think we've got more hikes to come Um inflation remains to keep in high the jobs market. Yes, it's slowed a tiny bit That's quite clear But it's uh, but it's still not slow to the pace that you would need to really see wage growth come down To make inflation more sustainable Could we get into a world where in fact the job market remains robust But inflation broadly comes down although two things totally incompatible I know I do think there is some sort of high frequency indicators that suggest inflation might be peaking and coming down Things like freight rates have come down a lot of commodity prices have come down Although opax recent moves will probably push them back up again a little bit So some some prices have definitely come down But I do believe and certainly the central banks believe which is more important That wage growth coming down is an important part of the mix Okay, so you did need that wage growth to come down It's it came in pretty solid again on Friday, didn't it? In terms of just their trajectory then you see 75 basis points in November Further hikes in December and possibly one in the new year as well Do we get to a point where something breaks before the fed gets inflation back to If not to 2% then something that looks and feels a little more comfortable Yeah, I mean this is clearly what the market is worried about The volatility recently you mentioned the volatility every day we're coming in and we're either up a percent We're down a percent often down So the volatility you seen the volatility in the guilt market that clearly was a situation where Higher rates or concerns about higher rates caused volatility and problems in that market So and debt levels across the economy are relatively high So all of those things",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1413,2022-10-10 07:06:29
13188," It turns about higher rates, caused volatility and problems in that market. So, and debt levels across the economy are relatively high. So, all of those things mean that, yes, there is fragility there, and this is one of the things markets are worried about. And fragility brings us on to the question of the fragility that we're seeing here in the UK markets, of course. The BoE coming in with the statement, I'm looking at GILS, not moving a lot today after they reiterated their determination to ensure there's adequate liquidity. Is the BoE backstop enough for GILS at this point? Yeah, I think it probably is enough for GILS. I think it's almost a kind of they'll do whatever it takes on period of time. The bank of England clearly want to stabilize that market. And I think they did stabilize the market, and they haven't needed by all that much in order to stabilize the market so far. But obviously, there's a lot of moving parts here. We don't know what's going to happen to gas prices. That's really important for the GILS market. Now, given that the UK government have capped gas prices for households, so they've kind of made the GILS market linked in some ways to gas prices. If we have a mild winter or a moderate winter, not a really severe one, probably there won't be a big concern for GILS. But if the winter is much cooler, gas prices spike up, for example, that's going to create more concern there. That's really interesting. The linkages between gas prices and GILS and we'll continue to watch that then, given the flag that. In terms of UK equities, talk to us about the relative outperformance of UK equities and the role of buybacks and how supportive you think that could be. Corporate buybacks even as foreign flows start to reduce in terms of supporting UK equities in the months and quarters ahead. Absolutely. I mean, I think we've seen it this year so, so clearly. The UK market's been one of the best performers this year. The FTSE 100, anyway, the big cap stocks, not the mid cap companies which are more exposed to domestic growth. But the FTSE 100, huge international index, obviously, it benefits from that strong dollar because a lot of earnings are in dollars. And half of dividends are paid to you in dollars, as well, if you own the FTSE 100. So absolutely, the FTSE 100 is gained from that dollar exposure. But it's also, I think, gained from the buybacks. The big commodity companies in particular are buying back shares. They're reducing their share count, their buying back shares, and they are the big buyers of the market. You're absolutely right. For foreign investors, they've been concerned about the UK. They've been concerned about equities generally and they've been selling it. Do you follow that trend then? Do you want to align with the buybacks? Do you want to be positioning within energy within UK? Do you want to be positioning within financials within UK? I don't mind. I think even though arguably, if you have a recession with more volatility, it's not an obvious place to be in to be in financials and to be in commodity areas. But I do think these areas are much better positioned than they were in previous cycles. Financials, banks have better capital levels. The commodity sector is benefiting from a lack of supply, really, which is keeping prices high. This is part of what's causing inflation, of course. So yes, I think there'll be more buybacks. As we take a step back from the UK equity story, and we lead into the recession, or I should say the earnings picture this week. And I said recession because I'm thinking about earnings recession. Is that something you're starting to have to think about now? And if it doesn't happen this quarter, does it happen in the first quarter of 2023? In terms of the timeline around the squeeze on earnings, is that something you have to factor in? Yeah, it's tricky for Europe. There are headwinds and tailwinds at the moment. So we're pretty aware of all the headwinds to earnings right now. But there's the inflation problem, there's the higher cost, there's slowing economic growth, et cetera. PMI surveys have all come down, consume the sentiments very low. But there are some factors pushing earnings up for Europe. The fact that European currencies have been so weak, which means that any company that earns outside of Europe and a lot of European companies do, when they translate that back into Euros or Sterling, they're seeing the benefit. So I think the Q3 results for Europe will be OK. There'll be a few worries. There'll be a few signs I feel that you're getting the domestic slowdown. But I think the Q3 will be OK. Also, the summer months in Europe benefited from still a reopening effect. Still that coming through. People using some of the savings they built up over the pandemic. But again, I feel those savings that they've drawn down a lot on those, the winter we're going to see higher inflation, higher energy costs for households. And I think there'll be less of a reopening effect. All of those things will bite I think in the fourth quarter and first quarter. OK, so it's the fourth and first quarter that really you start to see more of that pain. And you talked about the effects effect. And that's fascinating just given what is happening with the US dollar. There's a column in the FT today saying that it's time for the US for the Biden administration to step in to address the wrecking ball of the US dollar. Was it Witch одно?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1414,2022-10-10 07:11:19
13189," The US dollar, as a column, the FT today, saying that it's time for the US, for the Biden administration to step in to address the wrecking ball of the US dollar. So which parts of the European equity space then are benefiting from weaker euro stronger dollar? You talked about the exporters. Are we looking at the automakers? Are we looking at luxury goods? What falls into that category? I think definitely luxury goods falls into that category. Although a lot of luxury goods are sold in Europe, they're bought by overseas travelers coming into Europe. We had a whole wave of American travelers coming to Europe over the third culture, for example, a lot of them buying luxury goods and obviously their dollars went a long way given the strength of the dollar. So luxury goods is definitely benefiting. Autos may be less so. In case for autos, they're still a little bit restricted in how much they can produce, given problems in bringing supply in. But I think the other sectors that have benefited things like healthcare, huge dollar earner in Europe. In fact, it probably owns more dollars than your rose or sterling. So there's a lot of sectors, the mining companies, for example, dollar earners as well. They're also exposed to China, which is a bit more tricky. But I think there are around about half of all sales by European companies outside of Europe. So I think it benefits across a lot of sectors. Equities I know as your ballpark within the European space. But I just wonder about the corporate credit overlap on to that around concerns. Yes, we've seen pretty robust balance sheets, but as rates continue to increase, the squeeze on margins, what that means for higher yields, how are you thinking about the corporate balance sheet vulnerability when it comes to the fixed income market? Yeah, and look, I have mixed views about this. I think the large cap companies, perhaps they learnt from the last cycle, really, they didn't build up sort of worries and balance sheets. Through the period pre-the pandemic and the pandemic, in fact, they've kept quite conservative balance sheets in many ways. They didn't up their payout ratios too much. Their dividend policy was quite conservative and they didn't take on generally too much debt. So leverage ratios aren't particularly stretched. But the midcaps are small-willa cap companies, the unlisted sector, that has more debt. And of course, interest rates were very low. So taking on a little bit more debt may be made sense, but that means that as interest rates rise, they're the ones that are going to be hidden. Of course, that hits everybody, smaller businesses, mid-cap businesses, suffer when you get higher interest rates. Okay, so mid-cap smaller businesses may be something to watch in terms of vulnerability. I guess it's going to depend on the duration of the debt that they took on, of course, at times of lower rates. Sharon Bell, thank you very much indeed for coming into the studio. Fantastic. It's having you in the studio to kick off the week this Monday morning. Sharon Bell, of course, Goldman Sachs' co-head of a mere investment research. Maybe the full pain in terms of these equity markets within Europe, at least, towards the end of the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as well, the resilience around sectors like luxury. And of course, what is happening in terms of that effects read across. And maybe the UK being supported, to some extent, at least the big caps around these buybacks that we're seeing, particularly in the energy space. Okay, coming up, how is the Eurozone going to fund its response to the energy crisis? Our exclusive interview with the EU Budget Commissioner. That is next, of course, important details that we hope to get from Johannes Hahn, of course, Anne Maria today. That is up in the next few minutes. Stay with us. This is Bloomberg. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever. In not just in government research labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1415,2022-10-10 07:15:10
13190," This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. We have to get interest rates higher and bring inflation back to our target. 23 million people have been affected by this flooding and the pollution. Disruption is the whole point of a strike. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Welcome back to the open. We are 14 minutes into the European trading day. You're seeing losses of 3.10 of 8% across the benchmark European stocks. We have about 600 futures in the US down around 2.10 of 8%. Building on the losses, the very extreme losses we saw on Friday. We have about 75 basis points from the Fed, another jumbo hike in November. We also have $15,000 for several, but with similar calculations, we can see the values given by viewer sources. Well, Tom, good morning, and now we're going to talk with the Budget Commissioner, Mr. Hahn. And by the way, today is your annual budget conference, which of course for you is a very important day. But before we get into the details though, we were talking off camera about the pictures, really horrific today coming out of Ukraine. When you see that, especially the capital of Ukraine in flames in a Monday morning, what does that make you well feel? But also, in your view, does it validate perhaps the fact that the EU has to stand with this country? Absolutely, first, it's a very sad moment. I know this country, I know all these places, so many of these places, to see how the disruption, it's a nightmare. But it's another, so the example, and I would really like to use this opportunity to assure you, Ukraine and people that we stand on their side and we will do everything to support them. And I'm working hard to, so they guarantee the financial support for Ukraine, at least for the next year, in order to finance the running costs during the war, helping them, whatever is needed, really not only to survive, but finally to win the war. To win the war? And of course, you mentioned something very important. The cost of this, it's a running cost. It's not just a one-off. How does your budget feed into this then? Well, this is not something we can finance out of the ordinary budget. It has to be financed externally, that's why I'm in an exchange with our member states. I'm confident there is a great understanding amongst the leaders. We have to do it. We have to do it in a structured, predictable, automatic way. And I'm confident that we can get it very soon. Absolutely.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1416,2022-10-10 07:19:32
13191," We have to do it in a structured, predictable, automatic way. And I'm confident that we can get it very soon, at least to the surely Ukrainians on this side that support is there. And Commissioner Hahn, it's clear that Russia is the aggressor. Ukraine is a country being aggressed, but some of the ramifications of the sanctions, which of course you say you support, are felt by Europeans. You see it on the energy bills. You see it on the cost of living pretty much on a weekly basis. There's a lot of debate in Brussels in terms of how to attend to this energy crisis and potentially this economic crisis. In your view, what is your response? What does a solidarity joint response to it look like? Well, first nobody denies that this is a war and aggression of Russia. They have caused all the problems. It's about territorial sovereignty. They are defending also our values, so helping them means also defending us. And therefore, of course, we are affected. We are hit by this. Look at the energy prices inflation, everything. But then of the day, it will help Europe to, so they return stronger than before, because now we have to invest in something. We considered already important before the war, meaning green transition, strategic autonomy in terms of our economy, etc. So it's unfortunately a kind of boost and we will stand it. Of course, it's not easy currently, but at the end of the day I'm very confident that again we return stronger than before and we will give an example to the entire world. And you know, your colleagues, Paul Gentilani, and of course, Terber, I told him I would this over the last week, they made a lot of noise in Brussels where they said, a joint response means joint instruments from your budget perspective, from your department. When you look at the idea of joint response, joint debt potentially, joint borrowing, what's your take on this? Well, we have to understand that, of course, the leaders in the member states are very much under pressure because their people feel so they stress, if you like, the temperature in the way that people are looking on the energy pills. It's ahead of the winter. The inflation is the apprises are skyrocketing, so we have to do something. But now it's extremely important to keep solidarity, unity amongst members' days. You think that's going to hold? That's a big question. Come the winter. Will the solidarity hold? There was a lot of push back to Germany last week because of that big package. Are you sure the solidarity can hold? Well, this is a daily challenge and I think everybody has to play its role. He's a hurdle to show this unity because during COVID, we have demonstrated that we are able to act in a very solid way to act together and in order to preserve the European single market and the good thing is, so far, we have made significant progress in the way our energy supply is meanwhile organized, is diversified. This is one of the repower, Josepilus. And if you look nowadays, the share of Russian gas import to Europe is only 7.5% across Europe and this was before 40%. So that's a big decline and I wonder, now that you've laid us to me, we have very short time left but it leads me perfectly to the final question. In two weeks time about, two weeks time there will be a European Council. The market is paying close attention to the 20 and the 21st. Hope and perhaps there is a joint energy package by then. There has been a lot of debate in terms of what that may look like but the European leaders said we need to get it done in two weeks or it used to be something to bring down gas prices. Are you confident in your experience that in two weeks you can get to a deal because two needs seems very fast?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1417,2022-10-10 07:23:42
13192," So it used to be something to bring down gas prices. Are you confident in your experience that in two weeks, you can get to a deal because to me it seems very fast. Well, I know that our people, our experts are working hard, not only since a couple of days, but since months, it's not easy to change the market structure. But I think there is a clear understanding. We have to introduce something in order. And prices will come down. You're confident they will. At the end of the day they will. And gas prices too. That's the key. Of course, talking primarily of gas prices. And this will have then an impact on the electricity price. Well, Commissioner Han, thank you so much. And we'll see you later by the way, because we're on a panel together at the Spudger Conference. So we'll see you later on the day. Well, thanks so much for your time. Good to see you, Bloomberg. Tom? Maria, great stuff. Thank you very much indeed. Bloomberg's married today. Of course, in Brussels on the ground for us speaking there to an official involved in those energy conversations, the importance of solidarity. Later this morning, Maria, we'll have another exclusive interview with the Dutch Finance Minister, Sigrid Karg. So don't miss that as well. Coming up, President Putin blames Ukraine for the attack on a key bridge linking Russia with Crimea. We have more in a moment. This is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting, and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power-driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is, in many ways, the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Power, policy, politics, from the White House to the Hill. Bloomberg covers the leaders in legislation. That was really a tectonic shift for this White House. The theory of this bill, as I understand it, is there'll be a multiplier effect. How did Democrats mobilize specifically younger voters? Bringing you the political news you need to know. The president has made it very clear that this is a significant focus. For the intersection of Wall Street and Washington, nobody covers politics like Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Welcome back to the open. We are 25 minutes into the European trading day losses of 3.10% across the benchmark. Let's get the Blue Bogemezza smash now with Alice at Kinsam. Hi, Tom. Chinese chip stocks have slumped after fresh US restrictions on access to technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticized the curbs as unfair and said they will also hurt the interest of US companies. Recent American measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance military capabilities.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1418,2022-10-10 07:27:59
13193," Also hurt the interests of US companies. Recent American measures seek to stop China's drive to develop its own chip industry and advance military capabilities. Renault is said to be open to cutting its stake in Nissan. Sources say the two companies are ramping up talks over the French car makers plans to split its electric car and combustion engine assets due in early November. We're told Nissan is pressing Renault to reduce its stake from over 40% to 15%, which would bring it level with its own holding. That's your brilliant book, business flash, Tom. Alice, here in London, thank you very much indeed. Coming up, several blasts hit the centre if key. Just days after an attack on a key bridge linking Russia with a Crimea, and of course, after Vladimir Putin described that attack as the attack of terrorists. We're going to get more in a moment on that evolving story. So do stay with us, the markets, currently across the European benchmark, down 4.10% of 8% futures, pairing some of the heavier losses, though, in the US. S&P Imneys now do down, down 2.10% of 8%. This is Brindal. S&P Imneys S&P Imneys A.I.S is the chance of humankind to really understand itself. How much of that is true? How confident did you actually overachieve? Did you, you know, back then realise that we would be using A.I. in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today. But I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or 10 years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place. But I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this day, we still know very little about how the brain works. But these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things. Because A.I. or machine learning has become so great at so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence. Welcome back to the Open Wheel 30 minutes into the European training day. And here are your top stories. Broad based bearishness to European stocks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1419,2022-10-10 07:32:07
13194," Welcome back to the Open. We are 30 minutes into the European training day. And here are your top stories. Broad-based bearishness European stocks. Follow Asia into the red after strong US jobs data, solidified bets on jumbo rate hikes from the Fed. Golden Week Tarnis Chinese markets reopen in the red, weighed down by concerns over global interest rates, COVID and fresh US curbs on tech. Plus explosions hit cities across Ukraine after Vladimir Putin accuses Kiev of carrying out Saturday's attack on a key bridge link to Crimea. So the geopolitics again at the forefront as we assess then that response from Moscow and from Putin to the explosion on that key bridge. We're looking now at markets that are currently across the benchmark down 5.10% of a percent, pairing some of the heavier losses. And you're seeing that reflected in US futures as well. The DAX currently down 20 points to 1,001 by 6.10% of a percent. The Bank of England coming out just on the last hour or so, trying to reassure on liquidity saying they will be there to provide that liquidity into the guilt markets as they look to wrap up, of course, that intervention on October the 14th. Let's switch it over to see how things are playing out across the sector. There's a couple of interesting corporate stories including around Renault and Nissan playing into the auto space reports that Renault is potentially looking at reducing its stake in Nissan. But on the list currently is consumer utilities, travel, leisure and technology. A bit of green though in retail, autos as well, up to 2 cents of a percent. The key data point after the tightness in that labour market came through with the non-farm payrolls and unemployment at a record low of 3.5% the key data point now, of course, when it comes to the Federal Reserve is going to be Thursday and inflation data out of the US. So mark that one in your diaries if you haven't already done so. Let's get back to the geopolitics then. A central key has been hit, as we said by explosions, two days after that attack on a key bridge link to Crimea that Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed on Ukraine. Kyiv's mayor said several blasts were reported in the city's central district. This as air raid alerts were activated across Ukraine early this morning. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg senior reporter for International Affairs Mark Champion. Mark, what can we expect then today from the meeting that Vladimir Putin is called with the Security Council at a time when we're starting to see what looks like retaliatory attacks from Putin? Yes, I mean, you know, we know now already what the shape of the retaliation will be. All across Ukraine, there have been long-range missile strikes on major cities, on these civilian targets in the centre of the cities. This is something that you know, Russia's hits civilian targets many times before, but this is systematic. Oftentimes, there were, you know, possible explanations in terms of what military targets were nearby when apartment buildings were hit and so on, so that the missiles may have gone astray. But in this case, we're talking about direct attacks on a central park, kind of the equivalent of Hyde Park in London, an attack on a pedestrian bridge in the middle of a Kiev, and you know, other targets that have no other possible explanation, also on civilian infrastructure, power infrastructure. So we're really seeing a broad response to what I think was probably seen in Moscow as a personal attack on Putin when the bridge between the deep belt between Crimea and the Russian mainland was hit on Saturday. So the targeting, it sounds like again of that civilian infrastructure, as you say. What do we expect then? Do we expect any further details? Are we expecting a speech, any comments from the Russian President after he meets with his national security advisers later today? And is this a pattern that we expect to accelerate in terms of the targeting of some key Ukrainian cities and folding into that and additional question? What is the ability for Ukraine to defend itself against these attacks? Right, so on the security council meeting, it's got to be concerning. There's no routine that Putin comes out of these and automatically makes a statement.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1420,2022-10-10 07:36:50
13195," It's got to be concerning. There's no routine that Putin comes out of these and automatically makes a statement. However, he could. It is concerning that he's called this meeting as they've already launched what is clearly a series of retaliatory attacks. He is under pressure from the alternation list right to escalate massively, including nuclear. So it is a worrying moment. And then, you know, to the second, which is how does Ukraine protect itself? It needs and President Zelensky has asked for a lot of air defense. But these are, you know, expensive pieces of kit and it's a large country. We're talking about a country, you know, bigger than France and to protect everything, to protect every city would be an incredible enterprise. And Mark, are the Ukrainians still making headway in their offensives in the Donbass region? They are. And this is one of the reasons why Putin is responding in this way because he basically has run out of conventional military response on the battlefield. He's, you know, mobilized, he ordered a mobilization. There will be more troops coming into the battlefield over, you know, the months to come. But at the moment, they're completely untrained, not very useful if they are thrown into the front. And Ukrainians are continuing to make headway. The Russians really haven't had a response on the battlefield for a while now. So, you know, this, you know, largely explains why Putin is responding in the way that he is on largely civilian targets. Hoping one has to imagine that this will break the popular support for the war in Ukraine. But that seemed highly unlikely to happen. OK. Thank you, Bloomberg senior reporter for International Affairs Mark Champlin, who has of course spent a lot of time on the ground in both of these countries and follows this story in minute detail. Now, US employers continue to hire at a solid pace with the job of a straight unexpectedly returning to an historic low in September. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh flagged risks to the labor market from rising prices. We need to continue to bring down the flesh-hury pressures that people have. Certainly, what OPEC made a decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The president was disappointed. We disappointed as the administration. But we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean, I think that, you know, I had a long conversation in my office today. I certainly don't want to see that unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. That's what the Fed is forecasting. Some people say that's the objective. How are you preparing for the pain that they're forecasting? And what can we do on the supply side when it comes to things like immigration? Right. On the unemployment, you know, we were talking for the last three months about seeing those numbers go down. And in the year 2022, we've had about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month, I should say, last month, we're still seeing those numbers going on. So I think that that's something that is important that we continue to put those gains. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously, we like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean, that number went down a little bit this month. I think one tenth of a percent. So we're going to we have to see what's happening there. Clearly, the employee over the last couple of years is getting some leverage it hasn't had for a few years. A number of years, maybe even decades over their employers. You broke a deal with unions in the last few months with freight rail companies, the 12 unions. I understand four of them have ratified the deal, Marty. Secondly, what are you worried about the other right? No, I'm not. I mean, they're out there explaining, when I say they, the union leadership now and the bargaining committees are out there explaining to the members what's in those contracts. It was a very painful negotiation, not what I had, but prep leading up to me, two years of negotiation with really no movements. And I think that there's explaining to do in these contracts. And I look at these these contracts, they're good, they're a good contract. I mean, it's a 24% over five years. Healthcare, freeze cap, work rules change. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully we can get the rest of these ratified in the next, I think next six weeks. In the Rose Garden, the president said this because of this labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their healthcare by cap and across the workers will have.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1421,2022-10-10 07:41:16
13196," Slavery agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years improved working conditions, peace of mind around their health care by capping across the workers will have to pay. Have the poor workers on the West Coast security wash asked for the same conditions? No, I mean, I don't know, I didn't get in, I don't know what they're asking for for wages and benefits, but certainly those are all the conversations that are generally on the table. A little different negotiation. The West Coast port negotiation is a very fluid conversation that the both sides are at the table. They both have in conversations. It's a longer process than I anticipated, but that's just historically the way they've operated. They kind of take one segment at a time. I stay in close contact with both the employer side in the unions on the West Coast port. And both sides express to me that they're still moving forward. They'll obviously be sticky issues that'll pop up every now and then, but nothing that's making me be concerned that they have to have a 20-hour meeting in my office about. OK, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, speaking with Bloomberg's Jonathan Ferro. Coming up, Credit Suisse's Securitized Products Unit draws the interest of two big names. We're going to get the details. That is next. This is Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. Put the future work not be at home or in the office, but in the metaverse instead? There's that word, metaverse. Good. Well, how are you doing? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of actor presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world, and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. We have to be able to give our customers vehicles, you know, their primary vehicles that are EVs, and to be able to do that, we need to have range and infrastructure, and we need to remove the pain points. And so that's what we're doing. Welcome back to the Open Happy Monday. This is how the Europe market is trading right now. The benchmark is down 3.10 of a percent. Pairing, it has to be said, some of the heavier losses, the start of the session, futures in the US pointing lower by 2.10 of a percent on the S&P. E-Middi is quickly checking in to your currencies.

13197," US sense for the euro. The pound is at 110, flat the B.O.E. reiterating its determination to step in with liquidity if and when needed, as it looks to wrap up that special operation within the guilt markets by the end of this week. Let's get to what's happening on the corporate banking front. A couple of pretty fascinating stories evolving, of course, we cannot spend too long away from the Credit Suisse story. And that bank has drawn the interest from the likes of PIMCO and Centrebridge partners for its secured products unit. A deal for this bond of the business is a key pillar of the Swiss Lenders plan to downsize its investment bank and would help pay for that restructuring. Joining us for the details is Brunbo's Charlie Wells. Charlie, what is the appeal of this bond of the business that they like to get a good value for it? Yes, so Tom, this is a striking part of Credit Suisse's business. They sell securities that are backed by pools of assets like mortgages, famously, but also credit card debt, car loans. And historically, this has been a profitable unit. By some measures that has 75 billion dollars in assets, the risk here is that this sort of business involves a lot of capital, but it could potentially give some of these investors who are expressing interest in it access to some of those credit products. So good price, I couldn't say, but there are multiple people who are interested in this. So that's a good sign. Yeah, so it's an attractive unit for Credit Suisse or at least the potential buyers and as it looks to this major restructuring, of course, we expect that announcement investors looking very closely at this kind of beaten down stock and company amid all the challenges. When it comes to Goldman Sachs, they're very, very different story, but they face some challenges not nearly on the same scale as Credit Suisse. But when it comes to the consumer part of the business, we all remember Marcus, particularly entering here in the UK market, but now they're starting to walk that back. How big a shift is this and why are they doing it? Yes, so this is a really great story on the terminal Bloomberg's big take and it's actually talking about how, yes, Goldman had dreams of really becoming a centerpiece on Main Street in terms of retail banking and executive at the bank at one point said he wanted Americans to think of Marcus, that retail product as a quote, lovable teddy bear, kind of having more positive associations with Goldman. But what we are seeing is some backtracking. So there was effectively a funnel that the bank was trying to create to kind of bring in kind of the everyday consumer. These are things like checking accounts, these are things like a robo advising. Those are now being dialed back and offered to a more limited set of wealth management consumers who tend to be wealthier. So this is a significant change from plants that Goldman has had for a really long time. How much of this is down to the regulatory concerns? They faced a little bit of pushback, some concern amongst regulators. Yes, so they were, you know, they were moving very quickly. You know, I believe that it was the consumer CFPB. I believe that it was the Fed as well asking questions. And I think any time you see a bank trying to move into the retail space, things like fees will draw the interest of regulators. But it's just such a difficult space for Goldman, right? It's expensive to get in here. I think that could have drawn some concerns as well. The technology is really difficult to pull off. And it's also it's an incredibly competitive landscape, right? You've got the kind of legacy banks operating in this space for the JP Morgan's, the banks of America. But you also have challenger banks, right? Chime, so-fi that really have laser focused on user experience. And that's just so hard to match. I love this story because it's fascinating. Goldman Sachs with all the financial clout that they have and all that brand prestige. And yet, as you say, because of all those challenges, having to walk back their push into consumer and the retailer there. Thank you very much indeed, Charlie, as ever. Fascinating and fantastic on these story credits research as well. Potentially looking to spin off one of its units. We'll continue to watch both of those stories. Let's get the blue and both first word news now with Alice. Alice. Hi, Tom. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss is trying to speak directly to MPs in her Conservative party this week as she seeks to rescue her premiership. The Bank of England meanwhile has this morning announced additional measures to support market functioning. The bank will increase the size of its buying operations for the next five days to a maximum of £10 billion, double its previous level.

French President Emmanuel Macron has urged citizens not to panic and to act responsibly after a refinery strike left petrol stations with no fuel in some regions. The Transport Minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A labor strike has hit the country's two biggest refineries affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity. Global news, 20-ph, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, power by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Tom. Our sackens, thank you. Coming up is the fair to preparing another aggressive hike after those strong job numbers. That is the expectation. We're going to get the market reaction next. This is Bloomberg. We'll play the prudent thing to do is to ease off a little bit and just have a look around. Inflation, in focus. Thursday, on Bloomberg. When you think space, you probably think one space agency that travels under the radar is ESA. Which is surprising considering what the European Space Agency has achieved and how vital it is to the global space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESA wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move.

The official right now for the third quarter from faxat is a 2% gain with several sectors in the negative territory. We think that 2% is too low. As much as I hear people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1424,2022-10-10 07:53:53
13199," Now for the third quarter from faxat is a 2% gain with several sectors in the negative territory. We think that 2% is too low. As much as I hear people tell me the consumers in good shape, they're not. In the US, you know, the savings rates decade low, credit card using just decade highs, and it's definitely a deceleration. In the US, it's nothing that any of us like to write home about, so to speak. Nevertheless, the economy is on a more solid footing than most places, and earnings still look attractive. The next move lower will be a more realistic assessment of earnings by analysts. Going into the third quarter earnings season, if we have some positive surprises, the market's looking for good news, I think it'll be out. Some of us, I guess, they're answering the M-live polls question of the week. Will earnings bring a rally or a fresh low? Welcome back to the open. We are 52 minutes into the European trading day. You're seeing losses of 410th of 8% across the benchmark. The DAX just managed to screen out some green. Now it's range bound. Loss is here in the UK of around 610th of 8% the FTSE 100 down by 42 points. And the futures in the US pointing lower by between 310th and 410th of 8%. Joining us for the details on this market action is Bloomberg's Jan Pacti-Barnett. Jan, let's start with the question of the Fed. Those incredible job numbers that record low in terms of unemployment rate, 3.5%. Continuing to weigh on these markets, then. Yeah, definitely. The market was looking for a much, much lower number. Some of the whispers that are going around were below 100,000. So we didn't get that and the market reaction was crystal clear on that. That's a super disappointment. We saw this continuing in the early future trading today. The market is not pairing those losses a little bit. But the next step will be certainly Wednesday and Thursday. Thursday is probably the big one with the CPI and PBI numbers. Again, the market is looking here for a for a for a relief number. So the consensus is for 1.8 after 8.3 in the in the last month. But what I'm hearing is that people would actually love to see a number with a 7 in front of it. So we will see if we get that. Okay, and Dave, one of corporate stories and this is one of the stocks is actually in the green this morning is Credit Suisse on the story that it may be looking or at least there's some buyers eyeing up its securitized products business. The importance then, Jan Patrick for Credit Suisse of this development and the broader banking space. Joe, I would say it's very important for Credit Suisse. Everybody was saying like they want to see a decisive, they want to see a strong recreation of the bank. That's probably just like one tiny step on the on the journey there. But you can clearly see it from the market direction that everybody who is like still wants to believe in Credit Suisse with all the troubles they have. They want to see that the lender is refocusing on its poor business on wealth management. And that also means like that they have to sell some of the business even if it's profitable. And Jan Patrick, we came into this segment with some sound on the question of earnings. There's a lot of debate still as to how much of a drawdown we expect to see, how much of a re-rating around the earnings picture as we look at course of some of the big names stateside reporting later this week. How are investors kind of squaring up to this question? Well, we have still this big discrepancy between what analysts are expecting, what the market is actually pricing. So analysts are still like for a, let's say, a rather positive earnings season, what the market has already priced in something between 10 and minus 15% in earnings. So the question is like when we are getting something like we have seen on the second quarter that we get a earnings season that is not as worse as feared and that could actually spark by the market right there. Okay, so we'll look ahead of course. The importance of those earnings amid continued focus on the central banking action as well, Jan Patrick. Just one last one very finely, very quickly. 75 basis points in November. Does it change the pricing at all? Well, I think it's still on the table and the market is still like expecting that. I mean, everything less than the 75 basis points would probably be positive. I'm not sure they go. Sometimes the people are touting like a hundred basis point move that we probably would only get like if inflation is a massive surprise to be upside, which it doesn't look like right now. 75 basis points, I think the market can live with it. But if we get like a lower inflation number on Thursday, then I'm pretty sure the rates market will reprice that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1425,2022-10-10 07:58:40
13200," 75th place at the point, I think the market can live with it. But if we get like a lower inflation number on Thursday, then I'm pretty sure the rates market will reprice that. OK, the inflation number out on Thursday, as you say, lays a focus on that later this week. Thank you, Azheva Brunberg, the unpatriot by on it, breaking down brilliantly what is happening across these markets and some of the key catalysts and drivers. Your benchmark European stocks 600 is currently turning lower now by 5.10 of 8%. S&P eminies off by 4.10% and the NASDAQ is in the red as well by close to 5.10 of a percent after the beating that stocks got on Friday. Again, that inflation data out of the US will be central. We continue to watch the geopolitics as well as Russia takes out retaliation on Ukraine. Stay with us. This is it. That's it for the European market open. So, if I had a solid edition, is up next. This is Brunberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates. The second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love again. Now I would have a much more experience about those who say that love you and then they trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation. strong enough to stay. We will know. So really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Not only does it have to overcome inflation, but it has to restore its credibility. So yes, I fear that we risk a very high probability of a damaging recession that was totally avoidable. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And I think the sooner we start managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German power was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1426,2022-10-10 08:02:59
13201," For a slope managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition, but he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. The pace of job goes as cooling while still powering our recovery forward. Wage growth for workers who made solid down from historic high-paced months ago, but still growing for workers who deserve a raise. And this is the progress we need to see. This is Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition with Francine Lackwaw. Good morning and welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition. I'm Danny Burger in London, in for Francine. Here's what's coming up on today's program. Broad-based bearishness, European stocks follow Asia into the red. After strong U.S. jobs, data solidified bets on a jumbo rate hike from the Fed. Golden Week, tarnished. Chinese markets reopen in the red, weighed down by concerns over global interest rates, COVID and fresh U.S. curves on tech. Plus, explosions hit cities across Ukraine. After bottom of your Putin, accuses Keith of pairing out Saturday's attack on a key bridge link to Crimea. Well, it's a market just so far away from that pivot narrative. It is now far in the distance and it is a market that continues to sink after the losses on Friday with unemployment, staying at the lowest in quite a few decades. You're looking at S&P 500 futures, which continue to fall down 4%. This is, as we see, the world's global financial chiefs gather in Washington for the IMF meeting. Will there be even more pressure to the Fed to reverse course, considering the reverberations? We've seen it had across the world with a strong dollar and a bond market in pain. Now, speaking of which of a bond market in pain, we're going to get more into depths about this, but just want to point out the bank of England announcing this morning that they're doing more to backstop this market. Be it a rigo facility that they're extending out beyond the Friday deadline and having larger auctions. It's a calm market so far. We did have gains in sterling this morning. Flip to losses, but not too severely and a steady bond market as well. We're actually looking at yields higher by about three basis points. Also, just quickly want to point out Hong Kong tech chipmakers getting decimated whether was in the U.S. session last week because of higher rates. Today, it's about the U.S. putting fresh curbs on China chip, on U.S. chip technology being shipped over to China. The concern there is that could have profitability for the Chinese chip sector according to Bloomberg intelligence. So that's the view across the globe. Let's zero win on Europe because it does look to be again a day of red. Now, it varies depending on the region. For example, some of the utility makers in here, those are under pain. There's an FT report that the UK may be looking at capping profit of renewable energy sources or utilities, one of the worst performing. The FTSE mid, that's down about half a percent. DAX not doing as poorly down a quarter of a percent. And the FTSE 100, down about seven tenths of a percent. Despite the fact, Goldman Sachs pointing out that corporate Britain has been on a buying spree the biggest bout of buybacks this year on record. Well, let's stick with that UK story. I mentioned it. The Bank of England stepping up its pressure to support market functioning as its emergency guilt buying measures enter their final week. Now the UK Central Bank said it will increase the size of its buying operations for the next five days to maximum of 10 billion pounds that's up from five billion previously. Let's dig into it. We're joined now by Altaf Kazam, head of AMIA Investment Strategy and Research at State Street Global Advisors and our markets editor, Christine Aquino. Altaf, Christine, thank you both so much for joining. Christine, I want to kick it off with you. Can you just explain what the BOE has done here? Well, in essence, Danny, this is a way for the BOE to support the bond market in a more targeted way, particularly after we saw really the pension market really getting hit by the losses in bond markets over the last couple of weeks. Now initially, the response of the BOE to that was to just step in with emergency bond purchases. But we know that that puts the BOE in a very awkward position because they really want to be getting away from those bond purchases, right? This is the whole process of the policy normalization that they've been embarking on. They're doing rate hikes. They want to tighten policy. And so the last thing that they want to be doing is stepping back into the bond market and buying them. And so now what we got from the BOE this morning is essentially a way for them to provide targeted support, particularly for the pension funds that do liability-driven investments. To cops currently severelyίας in this unit...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1427,2022-10-10 08:07:43
13202," The Buie this morning is essentially a way for them to provide targeted support, particularly for the pension funds that do liability-driven investments without just outright buying bonds. So in a way, it's getting them away from that awkward position and helping them continue their policy tightening process. Is it enough, Altaf? Is this enough to calm the market? I think it is. I mean, like Christine said, what the Bank of England needs to do is draw a line under things, make the market feel confident that they've got the back of the pension funds, but not make it seem like it's an open-ended promise to keep buying guilds. So I think they've done enough. Time will tell if there's more instability in the pension funds, but I think for now this will work. It works just on a practical level, but what about when it comes to credibility of the Bank of England? Do they face a crisis of credibility? I don't think the Bank of England itself faces a crisis of credibility. I think the market viewed what they did is pretty credible. I think the government, on the other hand, is facing something like that, and that will have to be addressed in the next few weeks. It is interesting because this is coming as the IMF is meeting, right? All the chiefs gathering in DC and Christine does feel like this theme of, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy being at longer heads. Do you agree is this a UK problem versus a wider global economic problem? Well, to some extent, it is something that a lot of governments and interwanks are facing at the moment. It is kind of how do we really align fiscal and monetary policy at a time like this when inflation is out of control, but then you also have a lot of consumers very, very worried about a recession. But in the UK, I think it's particularly interesting because what we saw from the government in terms of the mini budget really put fiscal policy at a much bigger log ahead, as you mentioned, against monetary policy than perhaps other G7 nations. And that is precisely what markets reacted really so negatively to the fact that monetary policy on one hand is hoping to rein in inflation. But then you have fiscal measures that kind of seemingly go against that goal. And so it's going to be interesting to see what sort of reception quasi-quarting is going to have at the IMF meetings this week at the backdrop of giving that this is the backdrop of the UK. Oh, to be a fly on the wall, not just for that, but I would love to know what the calls between quasi-quarting and Andrew Bailey are like every day. I'm sure there might be a little bit of tension in there, but to that point, can the B.O.E. really start QT on October 31st, given everything that's happened over the past few weeks? I think it's really unlikely. I think with the way that the pound has fallen, that guilt yields have gone up, the prospects of it getting into kind of full-bledged QT, getting rid of bonds from its balance sheet when it's just spent a couple of weeks buying them to come the market down, I think that's really unlikely. And I think we'll see an announcement of a delay of that programme. What do you think, delay? Is that possible? Yeah, I mean, we are starting to see kind of the narrative and uncertainty around this QT process. And I think what the B.O.E. has done, they have maintained the flexibility over what they're going to be doing, right? They never actually have definitively said we're definitely going to start it at the end of this month. And so I think that kind of buys them some room to kind of say, you know what, given the market conditions, perhaps this is something that we can table for a little bit later. But at the same time, I think markets will look for the B.O.E. to eventually signal when they're going to start that process. And so I guess it would be quite interesting to see what markets are prioritising at this point, kind of the B.O.E. carry on with that QT policy normalisation process as they've carved it out initially, or would they prefer to B.O.E. to kind of have more firepower to respond short-term to some of the acute stresses in the market at the moment? Have you see that division between this ability to jump in, make short-term decisions to help alleviate the stress versus dealing with inflation, hiking interest rates? Yeah. I mean, the UK is in a very tight spot. It's got the tightest labour market in the developed world because of Brexit-induced labour supply shortages. It's got a currency that's weakening even as bond yields are going up. So the Bank of England is in a very tight spot. Like I said, it did the right thing, we think, by protecting the pension funds at very short notice, but it's going to have to walk that tight rope eventually and eventually it's going to have to stop buying those bonds and start going for QT. And who's going to buy those bonds when they're gone? I mean, there's still a bit of demand, I think, from overseas investors. I think a lot of investors are starting to nibble at sterling assets with the currency being so cheap.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1428,2022-10-10 08:11:43
13203," those bonds when they're gone. I mean, there's still a bit of demand, I think, from overseas investors. I think a lot of investors are starting to nibble at sterling assets with the currency being so cheap. That applies across the board, fixed income, property, even equities, I think, are starting to see a bid now. So there is some... There is value in the UK market. It's just a question of if that value will be destroyed by political risk. Yeah, and, and, Christine, I want to get one final one in from you before you leave us. I mean, dibbling in this, dibbling in, stepping in, I don't know, Christine. But anyway, stepping into the bond market, looking for higher yields, finally buying. I want to expand this beyond just the UK, but yields in general finally look attractive. Is Tina dead? Is it now Tia? There is an alternative? Well, I mean, the bond bills would like to have you believe that that is the case at the moment. I mean, we have seen over the weekend, who is it, Bill Gross, aligning with his former PIMCO colleagues and saying that bond yields are attractive now, so I'm just step in. I just wonder whether that is something that would make sense six months down the line, you know, because right now we're still kind of hearing from the Fed, essentially doubling down under a message that no tightening is going to continue. This pivot narrative doesn't make sense at all at this point in time, but I'd say six months from now, because that would be right around the time when markets at least are pricing for the peak of the Fed funds rate to be hit. And so it would make more sense to be a bond will at that time versus now. But certainly, you know, this is what markets do, right? They front run a lot of these themes way ahead of when it actually comes to fruition. And so I think, you know, this idea of higher yields, finally reaching a point where it's become a attractive investors does carry a lot of water as an idea. It just depends on the timing as always. I'll talk, I know you have thoughts on this. You stay there, we're gonna go to break, but we're gonna, we gotta talk Fed pivot next. I'm sure we will get very thoroughly into it.

There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. And private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

13204," We're paying a head right here on Bloomberg Television. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other. And we've just got to manage that collision carefully. And I think the sooner we start managing for a slope, managing for some slowdown, the better we're going to do. I think German Powell was way late to come to that recognition. But he now has that recognition and he should be supported in that. Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers there on that outlook for the US economy. Still with us to discuss that outlook, Altav Kasam, head of AMIA, investment strategy and research at State Street Global Advisors. And Altav, we just finished before the commercial break talking about UK yields. That it looks like some people are starting to jump back in. Valuations are cheap enough. Can the same be said with US Treasuries? I mean, I think US Treasuries right now, given the yield, look very attractive to a lot of investors, given the strength of the dollar. They've been a really great performing asset in terms of the income they're providing. But I think you're going to have to expect more capital losses as rates continue to rise. So it might not be the time if you want to time it perfectly to jump back into US Treasuries. But I think if you're willing to wear some capital losses over the short term, it might be a good time for a patient long term investor debt. Is there a level that they become just too attractive you can't resist? Nor are we close to that level of so. Yeah, this isn't the answer you're looking for. But I think the level they become attractive is when we're sure that inflation has turned. Okay, fair. Then we feel much more confident on the pivot and then it is the time to buy. Obviously you'll only know that when you look backwards. But I think missing out on the first, say, couple of months of a bond market rally, a genuine bond market rally, is a price worth paying to not get a burn in the short term. Well, let me complicate that even further in the interest of not having anything clear cut because we live in a world of gray. Even if we start to get indication that inflation is turning, can we be sure that the Fed will turn to? In other words, does peak inflation necessarily mean peak hawkishness? I think, I mean, the Fed has promised to be data driven and not use forward guidance. In other words, to scrutinize every data point, which is why we see so much volatility in the market, why everyone's focused on the next print. But at the same time, unfortunately, the effect of rate rises have a lag. So even if the Fed does reach peak hawkishness soon after inflation peaks, the effect of the rate rises they've already made will still be percolating through the economy for, say, another six months. You say that, and they've said that they're data dependent, but we've still heard from many Fed officials, Williams being the latest saying, we're going to 4.5%. I mean, that sounds like a forecast to me. Yeah, that does sound a lot like forward guidance. So maybe he's just referring to the dot plots, the summary of economic projections, the long term rate. Maybe he's just trying to do his own version of whatever it takes and talk the market into the Fed's point of view. But if they truly are data driven, they will keep an eye on, I guess, the inflation numbers that are coming up on Thursday for a start. How does this dynamic play into the credit cycle? Because at the moment, it is really just an issue of interest rate risk. At what point does that morph into credit risk? Yeah, I mean, you've been talking about earnings, and I think that is the next thing that the market has to focus on. How much corporate earnings are being hurt by interest rate rises, and how much corporations are able to pass on the effect of higher inflation. Both of those will feed into corporate credit, and that's where we'll start to get an in-clean of whether this is going to start causing distress and defaults. We haven't seen it yet, but it's something that we're keeping a very sharp eye on. I want to point out, I know we were talking about the UK earlier, but I just want to go back to it, because I'm seeing some pretty substantial news. 30-year yields taking the brunch of the beating right now. Yields up by 14 basis points, front and end, not as bad, eight basis points when it comes to the two-year. But it does look like a market that's starting to test the BOE again, even though they've come out with this idea that they're back stopping the market even further. I mean, you can see it there. So 14 basis point move, even though the BOE has come out and tried to calm markets. Does this pretend anything for you for what happens after this week when the training wheels are off? No, it does worry me, and the fact that this is a huge market that it appears to have a bit of dysfunction is definitely worrying. We're going to see mistakes, we're going to see things break. This might be...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1430,2022-10-10 08:20:26
13205," It does worry me and the fact that this is a huge market that it appears to have a bit of dysfunction is definitely worrying. We're going to see mistakes. We're going to see things break. This might be the first example, so it really will be a test of the Bank of England for sure. What does it mean in a world where you're looking at these assets, 30-year yields in the UK even treasuries to some extent that have been very volatile in asset class, where portfolios revolve around the fact that they're calm, that volatility is low. What difference does it make just the volatility aspect of this? It makes a huge difference because, like you say, as an asset allocation kind of construct to myself, I relied for 10 years, 20 years on bonds being smoothing our equities. I can't rely on that anymore. That equity bond correlation has gone positive and I don't think it's going to come down any time soon. So you have to look for other sources of diversification. You have to get more defensive in your equities and just having a 60-40 portfolio and putting it in the top drawer and locking it away. It's not going to work. Okay, well, we'll end with that sage yet depressing wisdom there. All the top, thank you so much for joining us this morning playing ball with the breaking news, breaking moves in these bond markets.

Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.

Missiles have struck key and other Ukrainian cities two days after an attack on a key bridge to Crimea. That Russian president Vladimir Putin has blamed on Ukraine. Keybers not officially claimed responsibility for the blast, although it has celebrated the explosion with a new, opposed-aged stamp. Here in the UK, the Prime Minister Liz Truss is planning to speak directly to MPs in a conservatory party this week as she seeks to rescue her premiership. Meanwhile, the Bank of England houses this morning announced additional measures to support market functioning. The bank will increase the size of its bond buying operations for the next five days to a maximum of £10 billion double its previous level. Now the French President, Emmanuel Macron, has urged citizens not to panic and to act responsibly after a refinery strike left petrol stations with no fuel in some regions. The transport minister says the government may release additional strategic fuel stocks in a bid to alleviate the tight market. A Labour striker has hit the country's two biggest refineries affecting almost two-thirds of the nation's capacity and China stepping up its efforts to contain covert outbreaks ahead of the party congress. Nearly 1900 cases were reported yesterday, the highest level in almost two months, fueling concerns about widening lockdowns rippling across the financial hub of Shanghai. Meanwhile, PMI data showed China's services activity contracted in September for the first time in four months as lockdowns dampened consumer spending.

We end thank you so much, Leanne Garen's there. Now we continue to see pressure in this UK market. It is a bond market where the pressure is back on with a BOWE who attempted this morning to get ahead of any market pressure, considering that their bond buying program will end on Friday. So what have they done? They've doubled the amount of daily purchases they can make in the auctions and they've also announced a temporary expanded collateral repo facility. The hope is with that that they can stem some of the damage from this LDI relieve some of the liquidity issues, but still it is a long end. That is selling off. We're up about 13 basis points here, still off the high, which was over 5%, but still it is clear that this market is willing to test the BOWE. Yes, the training wheels are coming off. Yes, they're trying to do more to step in and stop some of the hurt. However, the total purchases were only 5 billion pounds. So is the risk really washed out of this market when it comes to LDIs and UK pensions? Now coming up, we're going to talk about credit suites, their securedized product unit and for buying interest.

Good morning, Happy Monday. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance. This is the early edition I'm Danny Burger in London. Now, Bloomberg understands that PIMCO and an investor group that includes central bridge partners are among the shortlist of bidders for credits we say securitized products business. A deal for this part of the business is a key pillar of the Swiss Lenders plan to downsize its investment bank. And it would also help to pay for restructuring. Bloomberg's Tom Metcalf is with us to help us dig through all of it. So, Tom, I mean, another twist in turn of the credits we story, where do we stand? What's the latest state of play? Yeah, after last week's very much a wild week in the market with credits we started on sort of more positive foot with this news that there are interested parties in the securitized products group. And as you just said, it's really a key element of their hopes to sort of stabilize the bank and move forward. And really the questions are, what happens next both for this section but the other options at the bank are looking at. So what options then are we hearing from the bank to raise money? What are they dabbling with? Yeah, so alongside the securitized products thing, the other thing would be perhaps spinning out sort of the advisory arm of the investment bank, even under the name First Boston, which it was sort of retired a few years ago.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1433,2022-10-10 08:33:24
13208," lower than through the cycle cost of risk for next year. Really a bit more bearish, we think above through the cycle, mainly because of the work we've done around mortgages. OK, really interesting stuff to unpack there. In terms of renumeration, have banks started to slow down, how they started to cut staff? We've certainly seen that happen in the US. Same thing happening here. Well, first in terms of pay, we saw top-ups at the half year where banks increased salary rises that didn't come through in January of last year. In terms of headcount reductions, we've seen a few bits trickle through, but I expect the deluge is probably still to come. OK, and the other part of that, the impairments, how much do you expect that they will need to set aside? The banks, well, if you speak to the banks, they will tell you they come into this potential recession next year with coverage levels being high. They've got COVID-19 impairments still in place. LTVs are pretty low in unemployment, pretty low in credit card mixes, also quite low. So all that adds together to say that cost of risk should be OK. But when you look at the sheer amount of pain that the consumer is going to get next year in terms of mortgage payments, it's difficult to see that cost of risks won't go at least five or 10 base points above through the cycle levels. So consumers, potentially, those cracks are showing, but on the corporate banking and specifically corporate lending side, it's been really fascinating to watch a market that essentially seems frozen. That banks are just really unwilling to lend right now, unwilling to bring these packages to market because the amount of concessions they have to take are just so massively high right now. What does deal-making look like in the UK for these banks? Is this still a market that is frozen, considering the risks at this moment in the widening credit spreads? Just to bring about to mortgages for a second, I think. I think banks have pulled mortgage products. And I think they probably get a hard time in the press about the size that rates are for new mortgage holders. But if you look at the spread data from last quarter, banks making less money on mortgages than they have done for years and years and years. So it's worth remembering that their funding costs are going up at the same time. And in terms of the kind of corporate element, I think that, as you mentioned at the beginning, the Bank of England and government policy at the moment is creating an uncertain environment. And once that unsuaths uncertainty exists, I think banks will hold back from putting their balance sheets work. In terms of net interest income, because last month when we had banks reporting it, it was obviously a better reporting season for them. Is it the pace of gains in interest rates that is the issue here? Because obviously, just in general, higher interest rates means better net interest income. Yeah, you're right. They're generally, for most banks, the correlation between higher rates and better net interest income. I think the key determinant here is depositators and where that really sits. But the speed at which it happens makes a big difference for banks how they price their mortgages. If it happens too quick, they can't get the product out quick enough. And they didn't start losing spread on the product they have that's out there. So there will be a period of catch up for a couple of months to come. And that's why we see rates, more rates about 6% at the moment. They could trend higher. Certainly no boring times for you ahead. Thank you so much for joining us.

Chinese chip stocks have slumped after a fresh US restrictions on access to technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season.

Bloomberg understands the company will first attempt to break into the Hong Kong market. The plans are still at the preliminary stage and that's your Bloomberg business flash, Danny. Alright, Leanne. Thank you very much, Leanne. Garen's here in London. I want to look quickly at markets. We are looking at a 30-year yield which continues to move higher here in the UK. Yields are up by about 11 basis points that comes after a BOE which is really just trying to get ahead of market pressures, considering that the training wheels, the continued bond buying ends on Friday still not the best reaction. From the UK now to Russia and Ukraine where central Kiev has been hit by explosions for the first time in months, just days after an attack on a key bridge that links Crimea with Russia, a bridge that Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed the attack on Ukraine. Now, Kiev's mayor said that Russian missiles have hit critical infrastructure in the city. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg senior reporter for international affairs, Mark Champion. So, Mark, we have Putin calling a meeting with his security council. What do we expect from it? Yes, I mean, well, I think the shape of the retaliation is already showing. It's not just Kiev, but probably the largest set of missile attacks on cities across Ukraine since the war began. And the targeting is very much very clearly on civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, Kiev's central park, a pedestrian bridge. These are very clearly often in the past residential apartment buildings were hit, but they were somewhere in the vicinity of Ukraine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1436,2022-10-10 08:47:05
13210, industry and bridge. These are very clearly often in the past residential apartment buildings were hit but they were somewhere in the vicinity of military targets. In this case it seems clear that these are deliberately targeted civilian assets and infrastructure. So this seems to be the shape of the retaliation we'll have that security council meeting so this may just be the beginning. There could be further escalation. Well in the past we have seen Ukraine attack arm depots and other transport infrastructure in Russia itself. So why is this bridge different mark? Well I think there are two aspects to that one is that it is a very important piece of infrastructure for the Russian military campaign. This is the road and rail bridge that connects Russia to Crimea which was the next from Ukraine in 2014 and across that road and rail bridge comes all the military equipment fuel etc for the Russian forces that are fighting in the southern part of Ukraine. So it's very important in that sense but secondly this was a personal project of President Putin. It's a 19 kilometer bridge a very significant piece of construction and it was built out of 2014 to lock Crimea into Russia. So both symbolically personally it's an embarrassment to President Putin and it's an embarrassment to the Russian security services that it could have been executed because it doesn't look as though this was a long-range missile. It looks rather that it was a truck bomb. And despite what Russia just perceives as escalations despite Russia which is deploying more troops stepping things up we still see Ukraine able to make headway. What's been making this possible? Well I mean there's a sort of range of factors that go all the way from you know nature training to the enormous number of you know quite modern weapons that Ukraine is being supplied by the West and but you know there's a kind of critical one which is much more of a soft issue but that is that simply that the Ukrainians since 2014 learned to fight in a different way they've had eight years in the trenches to cycle almost you know as many as half a million troops through those trenches so all of those soldiers gained experience. The officers who you know came up through the ranks during that period are now at the very top of the the Ukrainian command. A lot of this you know Russia didn't have and the Ukrainians at the same time decided to have a developer really devolved style of command which allows them to be much more nimble make decisions more quickly and whereas Russia still you know is organized and fights very much as it did during the Soviet days. Okay Mark thank you very much. That's Bloomberg senior reporter for International Affairs Mark Champion.

There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3,000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. Cassidy.

Certainly what OPEC made the decision on this week to do was not helpful to us. The president was disappointed with the disappointment that there's administration but we need to continue to bring down those pressures. I mean I think that I had a long conversation in my office today. I certainly don't want to see that unemployment number go up. I like to see people working. That's what the Fed is forecasting. Some people say that's the objective. How are you preparing for the pain that they're forecasting? And what can we do on the supply side when it comes to things like immigration? On the unemployment, we were talking for the last three months about seeing those numbers go down and in the year 2022 we've had about 440,000 jobs per month. We're still seeing people 263,000 people going to work today. This month I should say last month, we're still seeing those numbers going on. So I think that that's something that is important that we continue to put those gains. We still have job openings. People are still looking for work. Obviously we'd like to see the participation rate a little higher. I mean that number went down a little bit this month. I think one tenth of a percent. So we're going to we have to see what's happening there. Clearly the employee over the last couple of years is getting some leverage it hasn't had for a few years. A number of years maybe even decades over their employers. You broke it a deal with unions in the last few months with freight rail companies. The 12 unions, I understand four of them have ratified the deal, Marty. Secondly, Welsh, are you worried about the other rate? No, I'm not. I mean they're out there explaining, when I say they, the union leadership now and the bargaining committees are out there explaining to the members what's in those contracts. It was a very painful negotiation not what I had but leading up to me two years in negotiation with really no movements. And I think that there's explaining to do in these contracts and I look at these these contracts. They're good, they're a good contract. I mean it's 24% over five years. Healthcare, freeze cap, work rules changed. It was a good contract for the employer and employee as well. So hopefully we can get the rest of these ratified in the next or the next six weeks. In the Rose Garden, the president said this because of this labor agreement, those rail workers will get better pay. A 24% wage increase over the next five years, improved working conditions, peace of mind around their healthcare by capping across the workers will have to pay.

13213," peace of mind around their health care by capping across the workers will have to pay. Have the poor workers on the West Coast Secretary Walsh asked for the same conditions? No, I don't know what they're asking for for wages and benefits but certainly those are all the conversations that are generally on the table. A little different negotiation. The West Coast port negotiation is a very fluid conversation that both sides are at the table. The process then, then, then I anticipate it but that's just historically the way they've operated. They kind of take one segment at a time. I stay in close contact with both the employer side in the, in the unions on the West Coast port and you know both sides expressed to me that they're still moving forward. They'll obviously be sticky issues that will pop up every now and then but nothing that's making me be concerned that I have to have a 20 hour meeting in my office about. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh they're speaking with Bloomberg's Jonathan Farrow. Now a panel of German experts have just released a new proposal for gas subsidies. It would be subsidizing 70 to 80% of gas consumption. This plan would be broken down into two parts. It would be 80% subsidies for German private gas consumption. 70% when it comes to industrial. This would be part of a 200 billion euro aid package. So again, it is just subsidizing gas consumption. It does not go into detail about demand destruction, which of course, we know would be necessary in order for to get these prices into checks. So again, 70 to 80% of gas consumption. That is the proposal for subsidies here. Now let's switch gears a little bit and talk about today's big take. And it's all about Goldman Sachs. Under pressure, it's dialing down its aspirations for the consumer market. CEO David Solomon is restructuring his consumer plans after costs overruns and missed profit goals. Joining us now is Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. Charlie, how big of a shit is this for Goldman? This is pretty significant. So for well over half a decade now, Goldman Sachs is really been trying to crack the American retail banking market. We had one executive back in the day saying that he hope that Americans would see Goldman Sachs as a quote, lovable teddy bear. We know that Solomon himself got on a plane as our story details and tried to sort of come up with some sort of partnership with the celebrity Reese Witherspoon, who was thinking of offering her fans financial services. But dialing back of checking accounts, things like Robo Advisory Services that were supposed to be intended for a broad audience, but are now going towards wealth management clients. So a lot fewer clients. What was the sticking point? The thing that made it so difficult for Goldman to get this off the ground? A couple of things here right. So at first and foremost, it's incredibly expensive to execute retail banking rights. So one study shows that it costs about $500 to acquire a new consumer, but then 15% in a year of clients, you know, leave a bank. When you look at Marcus, the retail banking product offered by Goldman, you know, that was supposed to break even this year, but what you see since 2016 is the bank spending $4 billion there. So it's expensive. The technology is really difficult to pull off. It's also just such a competitive marketplace. Okay, Charlie. Thank you very much. That's Bloomberg's Charlie Walsen. Of course, you can see the big take going and I big take go on your terminal. Well, we continue to watch a euro that weekends, German bonds, some of the gains there starting to peter out with news subsidies being recommended by panel of experts. The conversation and early edition continues now. It's Bloomberg. So you",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1439,2022-10-10 08:58:59
13214," My grandfather got into the Mutual Fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the Mutual Fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public and so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investable universe you look at the private markets and it's you know significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets but the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund and so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly the democratization of the of the private markets to the retail investors and I describe it as a bit of like running with scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately and so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it in to the average investor. Hey so you've got to explain this one to me what does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully. It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been and seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. The Fed is on a one-way free chain and they're moving very quickly. I think we are headed for a collision of some kind or other and we've just got to manage that collision carefully. We are walking a knife's edge difference between the soft and the hard landing. I think there is still some distortions that can be worked out. We do expect the market to remain volatile. This is Bloomberg surveillance, early edition with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong at Hop Stories today. The Bank of England expands its emergency support for the UK bond market, the new measures target the pension industry as the existing program of guilt buying finishes at the end of the week. Chinese semiconductor stocks take a die, they get hammered after the Biden administration limits their access to American technology. And Russia strikes back missiles hit Kiev and other Ukrainian cities after Vladimir Putin blames Ukraine for the attack on a key bridge to Crimea. Welcome to Bloomberg's surveillance, early edition, I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York and Kaley in terms of risk appetite. We're still dealing with the after effects of that jobs report from Friday and looking ahead to the inflation print this week. Absolutely, that inflation print is going to be critical, especially now as it seems that the market has abandoned that pivot narrative for the Federal Reserve, the jobs report really solidifying the idea that they are going to stay hawkish. And that was definitely evident in the Asian session overnight where stocks broadly were lower, including China, which opened back up after a week long holiday and it was a negative reopening. The CSI 300 down about 2.2%. Now in part that had to do with the Kaishan service.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1440,2022-10-10 09:03:16
13215," the economy. We are negotiating across European equity markets. Let me show you some of the assets that stood out to me today and will start with UK assets. We have just heard that the UK government says it will announce its medium term fiscal plan on October 31st. You may remember that it was delayed to all of the full fiscal details, the full fiscal package that was one of the reasons we saw a bond sell-off in the UK, in the UK. We have seen the 30-year yield spiking this morning and we have seen a continued sell-off at the 30-year. 4.5% now the yield on the 30-year. The bank of England confirming its policy, its emergency step in will come to an end at the end of this week. But they are adding another policy that will run till November 10th, which will be specific to the pension's industry as a window where they can place collateral with the bank of England in exchange for cash. A broader range of collateral not just gills. Brent Matas already talked about Renault. This stock up by more than 4% the carmaker has a big share holding in its partner over in Japan and they have confirmed they are in talks with Nissan that might result in Renault deciding to sell that and getting a pile of cash in exchange. Credit Suisse in focus 1.7% higher. There has been talk about selling off as a part of this product, part of this business, PIMCO and others, said to be interested in the report. We have to wait until near the end of October before we get a full picture of the restructuring and the reshaping of Credit Suisse. Yeah, absolutely. I think October 27th is the day. Let's talk about other banks, though, Central. That is the bank of England stepped up its measures to support market functioning as its emergency guilt buying measures entered their final week. The UK Central Bank said it will increase the size of its buying operations for the next five days to a maximum of $10 billion a day from $5 billion previously. Bloomberg's Danny Berger joins us now for more. So this is actually a massive amount of firepower. Will they use it all, though, considering they haven't used that much so far? I was going to say, if what they've been doing is any indication, probably not. I mean, the maximum is $5 billion daily or at least prior to this announcement. It was. It's now double that as you said. So we only use up five billion of this. That's all that they put they bought from this market. So will this be enough? They're really trying to get ahead of the market, considering that this program is set to end on Friday. There's concerns of the bond market just settling off. Again, pensions being pushed yet again. There have been a lot of pension experts who have been warning that they haven't had ample time to increase get back to normal. Their liquidity buffers. So we have this longer term, at least until November this temporary expanded collateral repo facility that's supposed to help ease some of those liquidity issues when it comes to LDIs. But we have seen a market that is concerned after this was announced. We seen some pain in the UK bond market and it's yet again being led by the long end. And now this recent break in line that the UK is going to announce their fiscal plans and the OBR forecast on October 33rd 31st rather. There's no 33rd of October 31st. It comes at a time when we're supposed to get QT from the bank of England. I mean, the timing here is really fascinating and it is clearly a bond market that's concerned. Long end yields here are up by 10 basis points, Kayleigh. All right, Bloomberg's Danny burger. Thank you so much. Yeah, I vote for no months being longer than 31 days. All right, let us turn from the UK to China now. Chinese chip stocks slumped after fresh US curves on China's access to American technology added to disappointing starts to the earnings season for these companies. Charlotte Yang, our Asia equity supporter joins us now for more. So Charlotte, tell us more about how Chinese investors are reacting to this latest measures from the US. Yeah, so the latest US curves have been a selling trigger for Chinese semiconductor shares today. And just to show you how bad it was, the sectors, where the stock SMIC has fell by most in two months. And also industry watches this saying these latest measures as it can be a big setback for Chinese semiconductor sector and dragging like revenue grows for some companies as well as the technology development. And they say this could also be bad for the global semiconductor sector given that rising geopolitical tensions between China and US. Okay, so that's the specifics around China, US relations and these chip stocks. And that is the broader sentiment for the Chinese as stock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1441,2022-10-10 09:11:49
13216," your political attention is between China and US. Okay, so that's the specifics around China, US relations and these chip stocks. What is the broader sentiment for the Chinese stock market as we approach the Communist Party Congress? It kicks off over the weekends, of course, and it's something that only happens once every five years. Yes, since it's just a really bad Monday for China stock traders who have just returned from the WICLan holiday, the gripping was a slew of weak data from consumption, property as well as latest COVID lockdowns. So sentiment is really weak now and people are not adding any positions as we're adding to the Communist Party Congress and they're just looking to find out more clear signals from which China is going with its COVID-19 policies, as well as stimulus policies. Alright, Charlotte, thanks very much Bloomberg. Charlotte Yang there, talking to us about what's going on in China. Now let's talk about Ukraine. Missiles struck Kiev and other Ukrainian cities earlier today, two days after an attack on a key bridge to Crimea. Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of committing a terrorist attack aimed at destroying civilian infrastructure. He called a meeting of his Security Council today. Mark Champion, our senior reporter for International Affairs, joins us now for more. So Mark, what do we know about the bridge and the retaliation? Right. Well, I mean, the bridge was successfully attacked in what it looks to have been a truck bombing. That requires quite a lot of organization and was an embarrassment really given that it was such a clear strategic target for the Ukrainians to hit that the Russian Security Services weren't able to stop it. So it's also a very sort of personal attack on President Putin. He associated himself very much with the construction of this bridge after a nexing crime in 2014. He wanted to really integrate it into Russia forever. So to have it pieces of it dropping into the sea is really a sort of personal front to him. And what we're seeing now in Kiev and across the country are missile strikes on a level that we haven't seen before. Kiev hasn't been hit, central Kiev by missiles on this scale for months at this point. And also the nature of the attacks, these are very clearly directed at civilian targets, a pedestrian bridge, a park, very popular park. These kinds of things, you know, in the past when residential buildings were hit, oftentimes, they were in the vicinity of military targets so that they might have been hit by mistake. But in this case, there is absolutely no mistaking at infrastructure and civilian targets. Now President Zelensky has been speaking to some European leaders and he says he will address the emergency g-set and emergency g-7 meeting about the attacks. What are we expecting from the Russian side then, Mark? It's been fascinating to what's going on in Russia, the level of criticism that has been tolerated in Russia of the regime or of military leaders. What happens next? Right. Well, I mean, there are two things to be said about this. I mean, there is, Putin is coming under criticism within Russia, but it's not necessarily the kind of criticism that Ukraine or the West would like to see. This is coming from the nationalist and ultra-nationalist right in Russia and they are attacking Putin for not conducting the war with enough vigor. So they're not against the war itself. They're very much in favor of the war, but they are attacking him for being too weak in its pursuit. And they are constantly talking about the fact that we haven't really started fighting yet with all the resources that we have. They're pressing him to escalate. In some cases, they're, you know, pressing for escalation to a tactical nuclear weapon as well. So not something that we want to see. There's no sign at the moment that Putin is backing down in the face of international criticism on the country and that we will have to wait and see what happens at the security council meeting that he called for today. All right. Bloomberg's Mark Champion with the latest in geopolitics. Thank you so much. Now let's get back to the markets and take a look at some stocks moving in premarkets.

13217," look at some stocks moving in here in the US and I have to begin with Rivian. After over the weekend it announced it is recalling 13,000 vehicles because it discovered a minor or structural defect. That is nearly all the EVs that it has delivered thus far. So that is weighing heavily on the stock in pre-market trading down about 6.5%. And you have another automaker lower as well. Ford. This is after getting downgraded from the least attractive risk reward profiles in the space as a result it is down about 4% before the bell. And another stock to note and this is related to the US China chip story is lamb research. This is of course is a US maker of the equipment used to make semiconductors. It gets about 31% of its revenue from China. So perhaps those restrictions could hit that portion of its business. And as a result it is down about 2.6% before the bell. Anna. So we have a new carium shared. Black Rock, Haydn Investment Strategy for iShares in the European Strategy at the moment.

Instant reaction on Bloomberg surveillance. The US economy is still on track. And what it means for the fat? The data will tell us. I think we're quite always away from the poll.

13218," Welcome back to Bloomberg's surveillance. This is the early edition on Matt Miller, a Kaley line here in New York and Edwards with us out of London. Now as we focus in on inflation, of course, energy prices are huge part of that. I'm looking at the week that we had in crude. It's down a little bit today as the dollar rises up. But last week was the strongest week that we've seen in seven months with OPEC cutting 2 million barrels of production. At least that's the headline cut figure a day. And even as we are concerned about a decline in demand due to an economy that should be slowing down at least as central banks around the world raised rates. Eddie Vanderwalt joins us from Bloomberg's, Bloomberg's markets live to talk about what this means and what we should expect going forward. Eddie, are we going to really see a drop in demand? We may well do. Look, I think, you know, if the world economy hits through a recession, then, you know, absolutely, world demand should fade away. But I know, but you know what? I think for me, the big takeaway here is that the long-term story for oil is extremely bullish because on the one hand, you've got OPEC trying to, you know, or announcing that 2 million barrels of they cut, which isn't even a 2 million barrels of they cut, they don't have that much to cut. At the same time, we're not seeing shale picking up at any way, shape, or form even at this $100 at barrel level. That tells me the supply side just isn't there. It's not there to supply the oil. That the world economy needs if this is a short-child recession that we've seen. And what about the broader energy outlook? Good morning, too, Eddie, for Europe at this point, a difficult winter in store. We heard from an advisory group to the German government this morning recommending the state subsidise as much as 80% of natural gas consumption for households and companies as part of that existing 200 billion euro package. Yeah, you know what? The natural gas situation in Europe is extremely interesting. What we've seen over the last few weeks is that the short end, the contracts for near-term delivery have come down significantly. We're talking about it, the same contract that's down 50% over the last couple of months. What that tells me is that the market is assuming that perhaps as given mild winter, Europe should have enough supplies. But at the same time, we've seen the longer end of the curve. So next December's contracts and further health, but above where they were a month ago, which tells me that the market says Russia supplies not coming back for next year either. Eddie, finally, just on a broader macro scale here. Obviously, early last week, we were talking about the possibility of a Fed pivot, the jobs report on Friday seemed to throw a huge bucket of cold water on that. We wait inflation later this week. Where are we on that pivot narrative now? Yeah, absolutely. You know what? I wanted to buy into that pivot narrative. I wanted to be the boo in, you know, I don't know, the China shop, but it's disappointing that particularly the participation rate ticked lower. Because a lot of that narrative is built on the idea, the bullish narrative is built on the idea that workers are going to come back to the economy and push down the inflation story. And now we saw a little bit of a wage inflation coming down as expected, but the participation rate falling. And I think that's worrying. But really the big story is CPI as we move towards the end of the week. Absolutely CPI, the next day to print to really watch after the jobs report from Friday. Eddie, thank you very much. Eddie van der Velte of Bloomberg markets live. And for more market analysis from Eddie and the rest of the market's live team, MLI, the ego is the function to use on your Bloomberg terminal.

We tend to believe that all consumers are equal they are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like. How much work on the pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's what shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers.

This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Galey Lines with Matt Miller in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Now keeping you up to date with news from around the world. Here's the first word. In Germany, an advisory group is urging the government to subsidize as much as 80% of natural gas consumption for households and companies early next year. It would be part of a $194 billion aid package. The German government will review the recommendations and issue a decision in the coming weeks. A mega yacht linked to one of Russia's richest men has docked in Hong Kong's harbor. That's led the U.S. to warn the city that assisting sanctioned individuals could threaten its status as a financial hub. The yacht, called Nord, is tied to Alexei Murdochov, who was sanctioned by the EU, U.S., and UK following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, Taiwan's president says there will be no compromise on its sovereignty or democracy. That came hours after China hailed a proposal from Elon Musk that the self-ruled island adopt a Hong Kong-style governance model. Taiwan's president said that Beijing should not make any misjudgment on account of Taiwan's vigorous democratic system. And Oliyans chief economic adviser Muhammad Alarian is blaming the Fed for what he calls the very high risk of a recession. Alarian told CBS that the U.S. economy is on a bumpy journey to a better destination. But he again warned that the Fed could hurt the economy by slamming on the brakes to fight inflation. And that, of course, this is something Alarian has been sounding the alarm on for some time, the idea that the Fed moved too late and now there's going to be consequences of that delay. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think, honestly, this is nothing new. The Fed moved too late a long time ago.

13221," Pack on a key bridge to Crimea. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kaley Lines in New York and Matt, risk appetite taking a hit from Friday. That continues to be the vibe this morning in Monday's market, says we gear up for that inflation print later this week. Yeah, huge drop we saw on Friday. At the end of the session, we were down 2.8% on the S&P. We're off again in terms of futures now, just about 1.3% of 1% so far, four hours away from the market open, so a lock and change between now and then what we got some headwinds, namely a stronger US dollar, the dollar index up 1340 to 1344, so gaining against most major world currencies, including the pound and the euro. And even though crude is off, it's at a relatively high level, right? This is text intermediate, not Brent. And we're seeing it trade at $91.96 a barrel. So yes, it's down 68 cents, but it had an incredibly strong week last week, the strongest in seven months, and that also is a headwind for stocks. Bitcoin coming down about 1% right now, 19,286. As the dollar gets stronger against other assets, it's no surprise that you see a little bit of weakness in Bitcoin, but we're still hanging around in that $20,000 range. Kaley, what do you see in terms of pre-market movers? Well, in addition to Bitcoin and crypto, I know there's one other thing you like talking about, and that would be cars. So I'm taking a look at all auto stocks in pre-market trading this morning. The first being ribby in, which is of course an EV maker, it is recalling 13,000 vehicles after it found a minor structural defect in some of them, but that is almost all of the vehicles it has delivered thus far. So that was weighing heavily on the stock down about 7% before the bell. Then you also have two movers related to UBS analyst action. UBS cutting shares a Ford 2 cell talking about a negative risk reward profile. Ford is down about 4%, and then also UBS downgrading GM to neutral, saying that the strong EV story is unlikely to drive the stock higher in the next six to 12 months. So GM is down about 3%. And finally, I added Tesla on here as well. You are seeing the losses compounding after last week. The stock was down 16% last week, and that is falling further this morning, down about 1.5% before the bell. Anna, I also have a car focus for Matt Kayley, but we'll come to that in just a moment. We've got stocks Europe 600 down, three tenths. We're not always so nice. Down three tenths of one percent of the stocks Europe 600. So picking up on the losses of Friday, yes, we were down in Europe, but the US was down more. We catch up with them in today's session, adding into that, of course, weakness in US futures. And that is meaning it's heavy weather for European stocks today. The UK 30 year year, once again in focus, it actually was up off 4.5% earlier on this morning. And it has been ticking up a little bit, despite the action that we've seen from the Bank of England at the long end of the Gilt curve. But now coming down, it has come down a little bit and partly at the same time, at least as that confirmation we got about the fiscal plans and the OBR statement, all of that will come in October 31st, which might come as a welcome relief for the market, if it thinks it's still a little bit in the dark as to how those unfunded tax cuts are going to be funded here in the UK. This is Renault then at 31.96, it's very trades up by 4.2%. They have confirmed they are in talks with their partner over in Japan, that is Nissan, and they could be about to sell their sake in Nissan, so as a result, the stock is higher. And Credit Suisse, their structure products, business in focus, it has attracted interest from the likes of PINCO and others, according to our reporting. And this will come ahead of a big reveal, Kaylee, on October 27th around their strategy. Yep, we will be looking forward to that in just a couple of weeks. Meanwhile, this week, Anna, we're looking forward to the kickstarting of earning season here in the US. Some of the big US banks will be reporting starting Friday with JP Morgan setting the stage for an earning season that our guests are gearing up for. Here's some of what they have told us about how it will impact the market. The earnings expectations have fallen sharply for the third quarter. We believe that they're going to be better than expected. The official right now for the third quarter from FACSET is a 2% gain with several sectors in the negative territory. We think that 2% is too low. As much as I hear people tell me the consumer is in good shape, they're not in the US. The savings rates decade low. Credit card usage is decade highs. And it's definitely a deceleration. US is nothing that any of us like to write home about, so to speak. Nevertheless, the economy is on a more solid footing than most places. And earnings still look attractive. The next move lower will be a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1447,2022-10-10 09:38:14
13222," The economy is on a more solid footing than most places and earnings still look attractive. The next move will be a more realistic assessment of earnings by analysts. Going into the third quarter earnings season, if we have some positive surprises, the market's looking for good news. I think it will react. Joining us now for more is Karen Chetid, Black Rockhead of Investment Strategy for I-Share's EMEA, what are you gearing up for this earnings season? Yes, thank you. You can see that there is some consensus building around earning bar being still too high to clear. When I look at the earnings season and I look at how analysts downgrades have begun to come through, there could be more to go. We see that earnings expectations are still a tad too positive. We think about the inflation re-pressure at the level of input costs that are still coming through. We like to focus on sectors that are more resilient to those cost pressures in this earnings season. Looking at the likes of technology and healthcare. There could be a lot of good morning, Karen. There could be a lot of focus on specific parts of supply chains and specific sectors and where margins manage to remain robust. Let me ask you about Europe then in this context. Looking at some of the data that you do, positioning in European equities continues to be extremely short. What does that tell us going into the earnings story? The geopolitical risks are plain to see. It tells us that we have seen signs of capitalization when it comes to European equities. Investors have sold the bulk of their positions throughout this year and we are seeing extreme short positions both in the ETF space as well as the broader fund flows space across ETFs and mutual funds. Very extreme short and European equities. Which means that European equities are really priced for the worst case scenario. Pretty a lot of bad news is already in the price. That's interesting. Does that mean there isn't a further leg down on earnings disappointments in Europe but there might be elsewhere? That's where it gets interesting. When you look at the earnings estimates for Europe, they are still too positive. In fact, they are still more positive than US earning estimates. On a price to earning level, there could be more pain in European equities because valuations are actually not that cheap given that the E part of the PE can still come down. But from an investor position in level, it's extreme short. How would you play this? You've got obviously one of the biggest paddocks of ETFs in the world. What would you do? So when we look at ETF flows in this context, it's been all about fixed income in the past month or so. We're seeing some signs of significant de-risking from investors. So one stat I share with you is of overall global ETF flows across the industry in September. 61% went into rates exposures. That's pretty safe haven to me. And most of that has gone into the short end of US treasuries. And the ETF industry is celebrating 20 years of fixed income ETFs this week. So quite a milestone here. And the industry has evolved a lot. But it's been all about fixed income and really safe haven fixed income in this environment. So considering that, I think you have $3.5 trillion of ETFs in your stable. What kind of growth do you see for this industry? I mean, in a year when M&A has fallen apart, we've just seen the bond market kind of shut down. There have been no IPOs of note other than Porsche. There continue to be a ton of ETF launches. Does this growth continue? Yes. Or does a recession slow us down? So it's a great question. And I think I'll take it asset class by asset class. When we look at fixed income, as I said, 20 year anniversary this week, the adoption of fixed income ETFs is on a rising level. And in fact, at BlackRock, we forecast that by 2030, the $1.7 trillion of assets sitting in fixed income ETFs today will become $5 trillion. So we see a lot more room for further adoption and fixed income ETFs. And in fact, during periods of market volatility, like what we've been seeing in the past few weeks, we see a go to fixed income ETFs in terms of really increasing trading volumes and liquidity providing. Now, when we look at equities, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1448,2022-10-10 09:42:01
13223," Go to to fixed income ETFs in terms of really increasing trading volumes and liquidity providing. Now, when we look at equities, I think you alluded to this with the launches. I think we're seeing increasing focus on more precision type exposures. So whether it's at the level of more selectivity on a sector and factor exposure level or whether it's on a thematic level, we're seeing more and more specific exposures that investors are going to play selectivity in equities. Harry, thank you very much for joining us, Karen Chedded of BlackRock. Coming up on the program, we will think about tighter monetary policy and its impacts on a different asset class. We'll talk about crypto. Tim Grant joins us. Galaxy Digital's head of Europe. This is Mind Very김. could any views about her Content. Most somebody is watching and says, I want to be a real man when I grow up. What should somebody do to get into the talent agency business or the business you're in? Well it's hopefully what I've taught my kids. You've got to be intellectually curious. You've got to show up and you know this like I know this. I got on a lot of planes. Yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god I'm so tired I don't want to do this. You've got to show up. You've got to be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over the place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. For a young person who now looking at a career would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual. You're always always learning. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Matt Miller and Kayley Lines in New York. Now Bitcoin is falling along with risk assets today after a strong September jobs report and recently defied expectations for continued hawkishness by the Fed. Joining us now to discuss Tim Grant, head of Amir at Galaxy Digital Tim. Very nice to speak to you this morning. Let me ask you how cold the winter gets for crypto then because you know you used to look on the social feeds of the crypto community and see plenty of memes about money printing by central banks. Well that money printer isn't quite worrying in the way it used to be. So how difficult does it get for crypto assets? Well you know it's a tale of an idiosyncratic crypto element and an overall macro element. I think what's been interesting this year and you've commented it in a little bit already since the beginning of the year. It's a maturation of this asset class when it started to trade. Bitcoin traded. All intents as purposes like a NASDAQ stock. So I think that started to change the way in which the market looked at this asset class. You could see the institutionalization happening. It's not a retail asset class anymore. And so the macro backdrop is really affecting us. Does it affect every other asset class? Just as we've seen in your graph there. What does that look like going forward? How cold does this winter get? Well I think it's highly dependent on the macro situation. The Fed policy makers in Europe.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1449,2022-10-10 09:46:28
13224," in your graph there. What does that look like going forward? How does this win to get? Well, I think it's highly dependent on the macro situation, the Fed policymakers in Europe, policymakers in the UK. Now, idiosyncratic crypto-aliments, we've seen plenty, you've reported on plenty over the last few months. We think the leverage is out of this system now for the most part. We don't see any massive shoes to drop. We saw a hack last week, yet another hack on a bridge. Will we see that kind of thing again? Probably. Will that really materially affect this asset class? No, I don't think so. Okay, so a lot depends on the macro and on the regulation. And you've talked quite positively about the EU legislation that we've seen to this point. And maybe the US, maybe the UK, are behind on this one. What is it that's attractive about what the European Union has done here? Well, I think the EU's just made a huge step forward last week, just Wednesday, the EU Council effectively locked in stone the text for what's called mecha or micah, the markets in crypto assets regulation. Now, why is that so significant? You know, 27 states across the entire 330 million population block have agreed finally after a long time, and a lot of uncertainty over when this would happen on the text. And that means that roughly, you know, towards the end of this year, early next year, we'll see that get ratified and go into the official register or official journal. And then in 2024, we're going to see the opportunity for anyone who's regulated in any state to do business across the entire state. Now, this change is dramatically for corporates and businesses who are in this space, the opportunity set. And I think it does kind of catapult a little bit beyond the US, which is still fragmented, still thinking about it, the SEC and the different agencies over there are still debating what to do. And there's obviously a political element there. Quietly, the EU has gone forward and created something that gives us certainty going forward. Okay, Matt, jump in. What happened to NFTs, Tim? I mean, non-fungible tokens were the hottest thing for musicians to board apes. And the values seem to have just died even further than the rest of the crypto space. Are they coming back? Well, look, the NFTs just like a lot of elements in this space, they go, you know, there was a boom and bust cycle, so there was a lot of activity in this last year as everybody knows. And awful lot of money flowed into this sector, a lot of celebrities getting behind it. And that always causes a little bit of energy in this space. Now, of course, that's deflated now. We've seen NFT prices in general go down pretty materially. What we're seeing though on the back end of this, and this is actually true in non-FT crypto markets, too, NFT crypto markets. We're seeing institutional adoption. So we're seeing big brands, luxury brands come into this space. There's a lot of talk of the metaverse, we're in the collision of the metaverse in NFTs. And what we're seeing in the background is some projects that really we believe in the next couple of years are going to kind of bring this back to the fore. But with something a little bit more tangible, something that's more experiential, something that really touches the consumer in a different way. So yeah, we do see in the long run a more sort of constructive backdrop to the NFT story, Matt. Tim, you've mentioned institutional adoption a few times now. How it is larger institutional players now in the space versus just retail as it was before. And I'm wondering if that may be why we have seen these assets so range bound for months now. If you look at a chart of the Bloomberg Galaxy crypto index or just one of Bitcoin, I mean, for about four months, it's mid June. It has been essentially a straight line with very little movement up and down. Do you expect that volatility will come back into this asset class or is that institutional play there a stabilizer? Well, I think it's definitively a stabilizer. And if you look at the chart that's up there right now, you'll see there was the material down swing we had around about the terrelluna collapse. Interesting to note that when that happened, perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, we saw a big onboarding demand from big institutions, big traditional hedge funds, banks, asset managers and downwinds, pension funds. And we're still working through that backlog of onboarding. Now, why would that be? You might think that as prices went down, they'd think, oh, hang on, let's step back. Well, no, they've been working on this for a long time. This is arguably a better entry point. So yes, you are seeing more institutional participation in the space. It has created a two-way market. I think also notable is the derivatives market, a real barometer of a growth of any asset class is how significant the volumes end up being in derivatives. We're probably the biggest balance sheet in derivatives in the world for crypto derivatives and we're seeing healthy two-way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1450,2022-10-10 09:51:05
13225," Asset class is how significant the volumes end up being in derivatives. We're probably the biggest balance sheet in derivatives in the world for crypto derivatives and we're seeing healthy two-way flow across the board. Now that's growing, well it's not over-egg the pudding that's growing, but in terms of volatility back to where we started, depends on what we see from a macro perspective and look as always that idiosyncratic component. But yeah, it's going to come back and I think we're seeing the hedge funds trade healthfully right now. We're making money in the same way that they're making things like frontier effects and frontier rates at the moment. It's very much the same idea. Tim, thanks so much for joining us great having you in the studio there in London Tim Grant. Head of Amia at Galaxy Digital Talking to us about crypto. Tune in by the way to Bloomberg crypto. That's every Tuesday at 1 p.m. New York time. 6 p.m. in London our weekly show covers the people, transactions and technology shaping the world of decentralized finance. This is Bloomberg. Thanks for joining us. Thank you. Thanks for joining us. I'm a blue bird, I'm a blue bird, I'm a blue bird, I'm a blue bird. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's... Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology, the Bloomberg. The lineup. We have some breaking news out of Oslo, Norway. The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to three individuals. One of them being former chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. The other two winners are Douglas Diamond and Philip Diveig, who have done work on bank runs and bank research. The three of them, Bernanke Diamond and Ben Bernanke Diamond, are the two winners of the Federal Reserve. The three of them, Bernanke Diamond and Ben Bernanke Diamond, and Ben Bernanke Diamond and Ben Bernanke Diamond have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics over that bank research. Very interesting. This is the former chairman of the Federal Reserve winning this prestigious award mat. We'll continue to cover that.

13226," Research very interesting to see a former chairman of the Federal Reserve winning this prestigious award-map. Alright, we'll continue to cover that. Of course, you're going to hear a lot about it probably from Tom Keane on Bloomberg surveillance next. So stay tuned for more on the Nobel Prize for economics. Now, in terms of banking, David Solomon once predicted Goldman Sachs would be a leader in retail banking, like it is on Wall Street, but expansion proved expensive and the bank is now reeling in those aspirations and the resources dedicated to the project. That's the topic of today's big take, which is a very big take on Goldman Sachs and Marcus Bloomberg Street, Naderajan wrote the story and joins us now early. Thanks so much for coming in the studio. It's a great story. And yeah, I mean, I think people have been waiting years for Marcus and for Goldman Sachs consumer effort to work out, assuming it would because everything else they do works out and it hasn't. And that was an interesting thing, right? This is a bank that's been around since 1869 for much of its history. Its prowess has been in dealing with hedge funds, in dealing with the big corporations and the big institutions. So when they decided to make the jump into Main Street, it was a big deal. It was a symbolic move and everyone was curious to say how it would pan out. Five, six years in, a lot of money has been poured into the effort. The results are not there just yet. And you can see in a moment of severe pressure, the bank is reeling in those aspirations and saying, maybe we did make a mistake, maybe we did have to choose a narrower lane and try to make sure from that point on the business as a creative to returns, the way they went wasn't quite it. So now they're trying to reshuffle things around and restructure what will that ultimately look like? Look, someone argued that what they're doing now is actually playing to their strength. Instead of going direct to consumers, instead of swarming the airways with jingles and hiring bad quality, and celebrity, reality TV show stars to sell their product, they're actually saying, we will market this product through our wealth channel. We already have a workplace offering. You have access to some of the biggest companies and their work forces. Try and offer these consumer products among the book of offerings you already have for them. That may be a better bet for Goldman Sachs than going direct to Main Street. I'm sure you can chart the history of the retail offering at Goldman Sachs quite a few years back, can't you? I remember post financial crisis, there's a lot of emphasis on banks securing retail deposit base. Have the arguments for really developing and investing in this beside the business that they changed? Is that part of the rationale here? No, that's a good question because the one part of the consumer business that always had fans was the part of the business that was stopping up deposits, the high yield savings account in Marcus already has more than $100 billion in deposits. That's a good business because no one can argue against the fact that the bank needs a cheaper source of funding and a diversified mix of funding and this is just it. So whether it's through the consumer deposits or their newfangled transaction banking business, which does the same with corporate deposits. So that argument hasn't changed but the problem was they were trying to do too much at once as they themselves acknowledge and that is why they had to take a breath, restructure, reorient these operations and hope that the detractors will go away. All right, Shri Nader Rajan, thank you so much for waking up early this morning for us and thank you for that big take. You can find it on the Bloomberg terminal as well as online. Now let's take a quick look ahead at what is coming up for the rest of this week. China markets are back open for business after a week long holiday. Wednesday is going to be a busy day for the UK Prime Minister Liz Truss as she directly addresses her mutinous rink and file Tory lawmakers in an attempt to reassert her authority will also be getting some GDP data. We'll be getting that crucial US CPI data on Thursday. US retail sales will be on Friday as well as US bank earnings kicking off on Friday. And on the subject of banks mad of course we just saw the Nobel Prize in economics awarded to Ben Bernanke Douglas Diamond and Philip died big for their research on banks as well as financial crises and of course that award coming out of stock home today Matt. Yeah, absolutely. We're going to focus in on that. Are we in the Nobel Peace Prize today as well? We got that on Friday. Oh, we got that on Friday. Okay. So all the Nobel prizes are we all done as economics does it round out the we don't know. I don't know the answer to that, but I do know that these three individuals will be splitting the prize for this year. Well, it's very excited. Yes. It's very exciting for them. I'm sure that is it for earlier edition more surveillance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1452,2022-10-10 09:59:35
13227," I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that these three individuals will be splitting the prize for this year, Anna. Well, it's very exciting. Yes. It's very exciting for them, I'm sure. That is it for early edition more surveillance is ahead. They'll have plenty more focus on the macro story, build ugly former presidents of the New York Fed joins. Also, the Keeper Cots for the Geo Politics, the latest developments in Ukraine and Russia. So this is Leanback. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in, to work with us, to get registered under the securities laws, because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform. Probabilities are not all non-securities. Now, there's another issue that's as a risen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age, where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns.

Yes, monetary policy operates with a lag. So we're waiting on those lags. We do expect the market to remain volatile. You know, these rallies that we're seeing, we continue to expect them to fade.

It's also University of Michigan sentiment on Friday. Come on. But yes, okay, CPI is going to be the big event, but there's a lot of other issues as well. It's about me to take that open seriously. Yes, that was. You Mitch. You Mitch. Well, look, there was a moment. There was a brief moment when we were actually talking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1453,2022-10-10 10:03:25
13228," But there's a lot of other issues as well. It's about me to take that open seriously. You Mitch. You Mitch. Well, look, there was a moment. There was a brief moment when we were actually talking about this. The 10 minutes. As the key issue. No, honestly, CPI will be incredibly important in particular with core inflation. How much does it rise? Do we get that year-over-year increase with some of the base effects out taking over with the core reading, even if you do have peak inflation on the headline CPI? CPI hijacks the conversation around the Federal Reserve's next move, where it's 75 or whether it's 50. On the earnings front, JP Morgan kicking things off on Friday morning. I think we've had warnings this morning from Morgan Stanley from David Kostin over at Goldman Sachs. Everybody just chop, chop, chop, cutting them going into earnings season. The why is going to be interesting. How much is this a currency-adjusted issue? How much is this a dollar actually exacting a lot of pain over international companies? About 30% of revenues from US companies come from international commerce. How much does that get really crimped and push people toward board domestic leaning companies? This is an increasing theme that I'm seeing in some of the notes. The outlook for global growth. The numbers that come from Tom Ollick and the team at Blumberg Economics, 3.1% for this year in 2022, 2.4% in 2023. Just decelerating through the next 12 months. Where's the growth going to come from? That's the problem. European recession this year, US in recession next year seems to be the base case for so many people. And then China, right, the elephant in the room over the weekend, came out with some data that was negative. They opened up, they reopened, and they showed that some of their services data actually decelerated, declined at the fastest pace going back for a month. So even though you do have a situation where perhaps the US is hanging in there, the rest of the world, there really isn't that note of growth that's going to come out. What's good news, bad news, Friday? Yeah, yeah. It was. Yeah, I mean, I hate doing it too, because it's so simplistic and what does it actually mean? But the bottom line is, the more the economy has momentum, the more the federal have to do. Bottom line. Bottom line. For now, and then we start talking about the why the Fed is backing off. The backing off because of supply side, positive e-falutions on the supply side, that's a good thing. The backing off because they need to damage demand, or they need to, they've done that already. I think that's problematic. Okay, it is problematic. The reason why I mentioned earnings as incredibly important in addition to CPIs. Yes, I agree with you. CPIs may have been this week, but earnings the reason why. It's a two and a half minutes, thanks. Well, no, that's a undermine your premise. I do think it is CPI week of October, but I do think that there is an issue with earnings. How much is the strong dollar impacting earnings in a negative way that's going to cause the Fed to say, wait a second. Suddenly the dollar isn't just your problem, it's also our problem. When does that become a bigger part of the conversation? How much does earnings really trigger that at a time when yes, you want to see weakness, but you don't want to see decimation of an economy where you do have a lag effect of some of the rate high. So we've already seen it. And he saw some Bonanque, sharing the Nobel Prize in economics. You're basically like, you know, you're going to, you're going to divert away from CPI. I'm going to throw you one of the bus talk about Bonanque. I mean, I think that right now the Nobel Prize is becoming increasingly political. What is the political message from Ben Bonanque? Are you saying this is a political decision? Well, what is the decision to have somebody who has a high profile policymaker win a major prize in economics? I'm just curious about that. I wonder if it's premature since we're unwinding the QE of the last 10 years right now, whether we should wait before we dull these out. Which is the reason why I'm saying it's highly political. It's sort of this question of someone who is still active in their policies, they're still very present in the public discourse that becomes a more politicized prize. I mean, I think that these are all fantastic behemoth minds in the economics profession, but they are incredibly polarizing when they have such direct effect on current economic theory and economic reality. We agree with each other. Futures unchanged on ESMP. We're down about a tenth of 1%, a real drama here in the Bonn market, the US Treasury Market close for Columbus Day. Looking at a German bungeild, which is down by around about four basis points, the bungeild 2.15% on a 10 year, the 10 year year in Germany, just like the 10 year Treasury yield climbing for 10 consecutive weeks. Ridiculous. Eurodollar 97, Eurodollar 97, a negative 4 tenths of 1% and crude after a monster rally last week. Crude is down about a half of 1%. WTI last week, Lisa, up 16 and a half percent.

13229," And we heard over the weekend, Jenny Ellen speaking on a number of different outlets talking about how negative this was for the world And possibly for what happens in November what I'm watching today I mean this is going to be a really important week it is CPI week and and to your point that you start the show out with Yes, it is that I just also think it's important to look at earnings today We have an incredible amount of speakers because nothing else is happening because the bond market is closed And so why even show up fed speaking clues Chicago fed president Charlie Evans at 9 a.m Fed vice chair leale brainer at 1 p.m Both are speaking at the nape conference in Chicago ECB speak chief economist Philip Lane speaking at 9 a.m And at the online ECB conference on monetary policy very curious to hear what their take is especially whether they start to price in Recession considering that everyone basically says it's a base case in Europe But they are still not including that in their forecasts and today the 2022 annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank kickoff in Washington From 830 to 9 there is going to be a conversation with IMF managing director crystalline a gourd Georgieva and World Bank president david mompass I'm curious to see how much the focus really turns to the developing world That's what we heard over the weekend from Janet Yellen saying if they are incredibly concerned about emerging markets in the face of the strong dollar But also in the face of some of these economic headwinds that usually hurt the lowest income nations the most people really going off to him about climate change Johnny at the moment I don't understand exactly how this is becoming a distraction I mean just to sort of add a show because he basically came out and questioned some some aspects of climate change And then people called for him to step down and then he pushed back and said look I didn't know enough to really be saying at any point and people saying you're just hiding in agenda The whole point is how politicized some of these bodies that have to be providing important aid at a time of real change I think nominated to the World Bank by the former administration ultimately picked by the Trump administration and there seems to be some tension over it with the current administration I mean that seems to be the elephant in the room Isn't it? What's wrong with it? So on turning around and saying I'm not an expert in something What's wrong with that? When did that become a problem? And again this goes to this issue of politicizing bodies that have to act internationally And the US as a leader at a time when it is splintered and it is divided And it becomes a real challenge at a time when there needs to be some sort of leadership to handle the next crisis Kind of refreshing for someone to turn around and say I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not an expert in it I mean it's kind of refreshing isn't it? I'm not an expert in it I'm not an expert in it either. Linda Dussell isn't either. She's on the market So senior equity strategist of federated armies. Linda fantastic to catch up with you Let's talk about energy 16.5% move on crude last week The underlying commodity had a massive move. The energy equity is about a massive year. Why are you sticking with them Linda? Well good morning. Thanks for having me today. Yes we've been really bulls on the energy patch For several years now and the earnings first of all speak for themselves There this is what's really been driving the market in terms of the earnings is the energy patch itself So if you look at the valuations of energy stocks They are as cheap as they've been for really over 30 years on a PE basis So they're inexpensive versus the Versus the momentum that they have and whatever pullback we saw earlier this year Was for concerns of a global economic recession And that has to fight with the supply problems So you have to pick your side there and we pick the supply side Linda how much are you looking at more small caps are domestically oriented US companies In the face of some of the headwinds from the strong dollar Yes, I know the strong dollar is a is a big problem But it's the multinational companies are the strongest position ones Those are the ones that you would own Heading into an economic slowdown or into a recession small caps We like small caps that they're not exposed as you as you've said to a strong dollar But that is basically an early cycle play So we really are more in favor of large cap stocks There's still the ones that are That are generating the highest profit margins. They're gushing Cash and even in the face of what's been a very strong rise already in the dollar We're all fingers crossed that this advance in the dollar will at least slow down and maybe pull back some For us the biggest concern with the dollar is what is requiring other central banks to do it terms of tightening When their their own economies are looking to head into potentially severe recessions And then a financial accident Linda this is going to be an instrument",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1455,2022-10-10 10:12:36
13230," of tightening when their own economies are looking to head into potentially severe recessions and then a financial accident. Linda, this is going to be an tremendous week. We were just talking about CPI coming out on Thursday in the United States. We also have earnings kicking off on Friday. What will be the most important thing for you in terms of how you plan to adjust your allocations heading into your end? Well, I think that the Fed is with the jobs you pour has really indicating that they'll probably continue on hiking and a more aggressive fashion. So the next thing to really worry about is the CPI in particular and that core part of the CPI where a third of it is the owner's equivalent rent. We've seen prices increasing dramatically, whether it's rent or for purchase and lots of talk about a recession and the housing market and about house prices coming down, but indeed the vacancy rate for rental or for home for home purchases is at a 40 year low. So it's still very, very strong. CPI will be extremely important. It'll be important also to watch retail sales. Of course, Amazon Prime days are this week as well. We think that the consumer is extremely strong. So just over the weekend, I'm reading the economy's weirdly resilient. It's not weird. People have jobs. They've got a lot of jobs. They've got a lot of money in their pockets. That's what really gets us going as consumers if we have a job. We do. Linda, that's the good news. Thank you for being with us. Linda Dussel, Linda Dussel, that offended. That's on the equity market on the economy as well. We're doing the match today. We can already. We didn't have it. It didn't happen. No, not at all. My sons were actually at the gate and they came home late, you know, being really angry. Who were they angry at just like the state of the world? No, the year situation and how there was cheating and that you know, no, no, no, no, it was cheating. Well, it was a suggestion of cheating and it was just back. They checked his ears, but it was in the sixth inning. So there was time for it to wear off. Heard all that. Oh, you're suggesting or your children are. My children. I'm not just. I'm not that kind of. Okay. So he was pitching so well. All the Mets fans assumed he was cheating. I'm not mad at me. My children may be a count for all the Mets fans, but I'm not an expert at.

Infrastructure facilities in eight regions were hit. The attacks came after Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine for an explosion on a key bridge link between the Russian mainland and Crimea. Ukraine has acclaimed responsibility, but within hours it commemorated the blast with a new postage stamp.

I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but you know some of the most recognizable buildings by you of course the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because first of all it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels it uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's the statement. It's a symbol of a city, it's a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate and sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politician. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. One of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors.

13232," Planscape. Coverage begins tomorrow, only on Bloomberg, your global business authority. Even Chair Powell has gone from looking for a soft landing, to softish landing, to now talking about pain. And that is the problem. And that is the cost of a federal reserve being late. Not only does it have to overcome inflation, but it has to restore its credibility. So yes, I fear that we risk a very high probability of a damaging recession that was totally avoidable. Mohamed Al-Ary and Bloomberg opinion columnist and president of Queens College Cambridge on CBS over the weekend and New York Metz fan as well. Loves the Jets too and the Jets actually one over the weekend. Yeah, they did. So that's the good news. Right, the bad news is that my kids are giant fans as he asks. Oh, that giant fans. OK. So they don't have any potential. And his comments, though, were really fascinating over the weekend. His comments are always fascinating. It's great. Basically saying how avoidable this was, that the Fed made an error that is going to be incredibly painful to potentially remedy. And that's the reason why I pushed back a little bit about the politicization of prior Fed officials. As you said, very rightly, John, we have not seen the legacy of this particular policy with respect to monetary easing and quantitative easing. It's just not clear what the legacy will actually be. Two mistakes for a lot of people. The first one is that they were late and the second one is that they might overdo it. And that's the problem so many people have. Every research piece that I read after Friday's jobs report just said 75 basis points now done. Here we go again. And people saying that the Joel's report indicates a bit pretty quick cooling. So at what point is there this push pull of acknowledging the weakening data or at least the weakening around the edges in an economy that could allow the Fed to move a little more slowly, but they don't want to make the same mistake. So they're going to keep the pedal on the gas in terms of how quickly they decelerate this. Can we talk about the UK briefly? Sure. Bringing forward its fiscal announcement to the end of this month alongside the OBR forecast as well. Halloween. Who scheduled it for Halloween? I'm sure they've got a good reason for it. But can you imagine what the front page of the newspapers are going to look like? Yeah. Why? What is wrong with these communications departments of these governments? I just don't get it at all. I can't. I'm not an expert. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm going to keep using that over and over again. I think it's perfect for today. Not an expert in it either, but that just seems ridiculous. It's ridiculous. And honestly, bringing it forward is spooky enough for the markets because clearly they're going to basically be caving to what the market is saying. But second of all, to wait that long and then to wait for that day. I mean, they're basically just setting themselves up for ridicule. You're going to do boo the whole hour. Boo. It's not scary at all. AMH, Dan and DC, up Bloomberg, Washington correspondent joins us now. Amary, what dreadful pictures over the weekend in Ukraine through Crimea? What's going on now, AMH? And how is this administration responding? It's incredibly dreadful and devastating. The pictures coming out of Ukraine, especially this morning, Jonathan Keave. This is a lot of civilians that are being targeted by these missile strikes. We don't have a statement yet from the administration on what we're seeing just newly this morning from the ground in Ukraine. But what we can expect, according to President Zelensky, who's been working the phones. He recently this morning was on the phone with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Germany holds the presidency of the G7 meeting. It does seem like there will be an urgent gathering virtually of these leaders and how they're going to respond. What you can expect, the Ukrainians are going to ask for, obviously, is more weapons. Maybe now what we're seeing, they'll ask for potentially another no-fly zone. It's something we haven't really heard about. But this was a huge target for the Ukrainians and a goal of theirs and an aim of theirs to ask for when the war first began, of course, back in February. And Ray, what counts as a major escalation in this war? And why does it matter? It's a great question. I think at this moment, what we've been talking about in terms of a major escalation was the fact that Putin, of course, had been brandishing the idea of using nuclear weapons. And we've heard over the weekend from the National Security Council's Admiral General Kirby, who's their spokesperson, talking about the fact that there would be severe consequences if Putin were to do this. But what it does?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1458,2022-10-10 10:25:49
13233," The National Security Council's Admiral General Kirby, who is their spokesperson, talking about the fact that there would be severe consequences if Putin were to do this. But what it does look like you're seeing now on the ground is almost a tit for tat. Putin has said that it was the Ukrainians that blew up this bridge, a blast on the bridge that connects Russia to Crimea. We should note that this bridge is incredibly important to Putin not just tactically for Russia in terms of getting supplies to his troops in Crimea, but also personally. In 2016, he said this is a historical mission for Russia. It was a dream of his to unite Russia with Crimea. And then in 2018, when that bridge opened, he personally opened it by driving a truck down that bridge. And then what do you have two days later, a barrage that we have not seen since the beginning of this war on Kiev and also the fact that Putin has now put in place a single general of his operation. And this is a general that led Russian troops in Syria when they absolutely destroyed Aleppo. So you can imagine the scenes that may be coming out of Ukraine in the next few days. Amary, just a fun word on OPEC if we can. Get staff to guest over the weekend and over the last week that came from the administration on various networks, including on this one on TV and radio, said the same thing that disappointed in OPEC. What options do they actually have? Well, they definitely are disappointed. Your four weeks out from the midterm elections and gas prices still remain top of voters' minds. There's not a lot they can do unless they want to tap the SPR again. But remember the SPR right now, where at stocks as low as from the 1980s. But Jonathan, politically, you already see Rokana and also Senator Bumenthal writing last night in political and opinion piece that they are going to offer by-camera legislation to stop immediately U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. So potentially the response may be towards Saudi Arabia in particular, unless so the U.S. has a lot of weight right now in terms of oil. There's also the Wall Street Journal reporting. Maybe that they'll lift some sanctions on Venezuela. So does seem that they have a few tools to use, but they're probably not what they wanted as their first primary tool in the toolbox. MH, thank you. Amiri, Dan and DC, Brent Crude right now, 97.31. Sullivan fully realized the fallout from last week halfway on the old front at Seoul Lisa. Both from a market perspective as well as from a political perspective. Right? Emory talking about a possible repercussions for Saudi Arabia from the United States. My question is why? We haven't necessarily seen a price surge in Crude. There is a question about whether there is some reality to the decline in demand that we have not necessarily seen yet. But is this also the alliance with Russia? Right? This sort of discussion of the possible caps on the oil prices as being enough of an inconvenience or an uncertainty that would necessitate this kind of action. And I wonder how much that's sort of playing into the backdrop here. If you strip out of the politics, I know it's tremendously difficult to do that. But if you are the cartel, OPEC Plus, I'm sure they love to call themselves that. If you are OPEC Plus and you're looking at all these warnings about decelerating economic growth in the United States and worldwide, then does it make sense to pull back on output? And perhaps it does if you don't have much spare capacity. Well, but that's the key issue. The spare capacity, how much is that the real story and actually speaks to much higher prices regardless of what they say in terms of their output targets. We just don't have the ability to pump it and they want to save it for when there is really a necessary circumstance. Features on the S&P 500 this morning, slightly negative life from New York.

We have gone from about 82 bases points 10 weeks ago to more than 2% right now and I have to tell you the Italian 10 year for 74 and the spread between the German and the Italian 10 year at the Wines of the Year now, Lisa 255. Gotta go back to 2020 for a level bigger than that. And people are expecting a 75 bases point rate hike from the ECB at their next meeting.

13235," Basically making the negative yielding regime extinct, save for what's happening in Japan. And that's a huge about phase considering where we were just a year ago. Is the euro starting to trade on spreads? Take a look at euro dollar. Euro dollar negative by 4.10% of 1% just about holding on to 97. They said you think spread is starting to matter for a single currency going into the ECB in a couple of weeks? They have to. Because if the ECB is concerned about financial stability in Italy, in closing that spread, that gap, then perhaps they won't be as aggressive in terms of how much they tighten, which would be not necessarily supportive maybe for the euro. But again, what does the ECB have? What effect do they have on yields right now based on the idea that a lot of it's trading on the economic prospects, the more the ECB hikes, while previously perhaps bullish for the euro might not be if that means weaker growth going forward. It's they might have a problem in a way to come. The UK's got one already. Danny Birk, a jointist now, Adelaunton, Danny Walkers through. The latest moves from the bank giving them to do something about this bond market. Yeah, I've been trying to think of the analogy for this and I think I've got it, John, but it might be a little bit sloppy. Essentially, the BOE is just pouring in an entire bottle of booze into the punch bowl just before taking it away. So we're still getting the end of this long term bond buying program on Friday, but they doubled the amount of this daily auction. The problem is, does that stop this pension doom loop if nobody uses it? And no one has really been using it. I mean, people have, but the maximum has been $40 billion. They've only bought five billion pounds, I should say, pounds worth of debt, although dollar pound basically the same now. So there's that issue. Perhaps the more interesting thing they've done then is put this new short term funding facility into the works. It's set to expire at least for now on November 10th, so that allows banks to draw down more cash, put up collateral that also could take the form of corporate bonds. Again, in this effort to get that cash instead of having to do a fire sale bus creating this doom loop we've seen. Do we have a better sequence of events on a calendar now with October 31 being the day in the diary for the fiscal event and then November 3rd, the Bank of England? Well, I mean, October 31st is also the day that QT is supposed to start. So it's still an extremely difficult calendar. If we get the BOE, they stop buying bonds this Friday, come to 31st. Yes, there's more calm. There's more hope considering that the OBR budget has been moved up to the 31st. The fiscal event moved there as well. But again, it could be a day of extreme volatility if the BOE is starting to do QT on the same day. We're going to get this budget with still lots of question marks surrounding it. Danny, how much pressure is there to move the budget up yet again to October 16th or October 14th around the time of this expiration of the current bond purchasing program? I mean, huge pressure considering it is a bond market that continues to sell off. We've seen the long end of the curve retrace about half of the rally we saw since the BOE stepped in. It is a market that is extremely still worried about what happens after Friday. If they have to wait until the 31st for both QT and that budget, again, I go back to this. I'm going to be very challenging timeline and considering quasi-corting is in DC meeting with other central bank cheese meeting with the IMF who has criticized them, the pressure is going to be on. Danny, thank you. Wonderful. As always, Danny Berger and a London, here from Bloomberg, the 10-year guild up by around about 10 basis points, at least at a 30-year, up by 14. This hasn't necessarily ended the crisis in some of the pensions. And this a lot of people are talking about how there is a massive trade that's still being unwound with some of the pensions that tried to match their liabilities and hedge out risk that are being upended. How much they can do this at an easy pace, right? Because it's not about staving off the declines in some of these long bond prices. It's about how do you control it from a financial stability standpoint? I don't understand the difference completely. Marcus Nashworth, Mike. Bloomberg opinion columnist joins us right now. Marcus, your thoughts on what we got from the Bank of England earlier today? Well, I think that was a necessary move. I don't see any cliffhage. I'm not quite sure I totally agree with Danny's saying that. But certainly it's not the party I don't want to go to because they've increased him out that they're going to buy. But that's just a normal thing. I don't think we'll see anything like 10 billion or even 5 billion. As you did point out, if any of the bank savings are even 5 billion, so...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1461,2022-10-10 10:38:53
13236," in 5 billion. As she did point out, if the bank of New Zealand was 5 billion so far, throughout half of the process, I think they're just trying to swage as many people as possible that they're on top of it with the guards to people needing to sell. The backs stop bit, they're not in the mid as they were starting. They've sorted out the gaming of it, but a lot of hedge funds are probably piling in. They're now adding out a repositility for at least on the month so people can put in corporate bonds, all the things rather just guilds. They're doing their best. However, October 31, we're on a date for the government to put on it. It's right where not just QT is active QT is supposed to start again, which must be delayed by the bank of England. That's clearly right on their doorstep. They've landed that one. At the same time, there's a big guild torch in that week, and only through four days later we got both a Fed and the Bank of England's decisionary interest rates. It's a terrible week to start off. IE, that October 31 had better be what the market once from quasi-quartane. Otherwise, we have a week of absolute nightmare. Marcus, how much is the Bank of England setting the tone for what's going to happen at the European Central Bank, with backing away from perhaps quantitative tightening, or at least coming up with some quantitative buying in addition to quantitative letting it roll off? I don't think it's easy be what will be taking much stock of what the Bank of England is doing. Other than they know not to mess perhaps with quantitative tightening this year at least. They had a meeting last week where they started to think about talking about it, but I bet you they just pushed it off into as far as that long-gross they possibly can. Do not touch quantitative tightening for the ECB. Must surely be the message the Bank of England had into them. What's the difference right now, Marcus, between prices declining and a financial stability risk? Well, that's a very interesting thing. I think the US Fed used to be paying much more attention with the volatility in the move index. We can clearly see and big active quantitative tightening coming down the pipe here from the Fed that they've gotten very careful that you know, conflating interest rate hikes at the same time as big quantitative tightening is an experiment we've never really seen before. And clearly, the very sensitive nature of the UK market, which everyone thought that was a safe boring bit, shows you that this is a very, very difficult situation to do at the same time. And I hope they understand that the financial stability is just a part of their mandate is controlling inflation. Marcus, you said something interesting a few minutes ago. You said they'd better bring what the market wants to see. Marcus, what do you think the market actually wants to see from the chancellor? Well, they want to see some funded spending and indeed cuts to what they exactly expect over three and probably more likely to extend it, I think, to five years as to how they're going to balance the budget. Can the numbers add up? Are they believable? And at one stroke, you could cancel, I think, with HS2, a bigger LW line for 100 billion pounds. That would solve that problem, but that causes bigger problems elsewhere. You can't just cut health spend. You can't just cancel or keep where for benefits on a lower level. They've got to do something which is sustainable and show that all the numbers with a large borrower and they want to do not just this year, much more importantly, next year as well. Huge boring, expected next year for the magazine. That's the real reason by guilt to worry at the moment. And I think they need to have an ability to show that they have a spending plans which makes sense with their debt raising. Marcus, some of the announcements of the chancellor made a number of Fridays ago have been widely ridiculed. I just wonder how many people in about 12 months time will actually be pushing for some of these initiatives again, Marcus, because the economy's going to roll over. Well, this is the irony. I mean, some of the stuff that he suggested would be great actually years time once they've got there at the, put their homework, clear the out for everyone to see how everything's going to make sense and their priorities were, I think, about face. But there are a lot more things that need to be done. Some of the things that they've reversed, particularly Richie Sunnack's corporate tax hikes and obviously the national insurance rates make sense. But I mean, I equally think they've got to bring everyone along with them. And it's the whole presentation of what was, could have been a good plan, was completely misguided. And that unfortunately, that pain of price calls. Don't mess with the bond markets, John. Don't mess with the bond market. Is that the message to it, Silly, as well? Well, most certainly, and they've got to worry, they've got something like 250 billion to refinance next year. Oh, it would interest rates now up from about one and a half to maybe four and a half. That cost is going through the roof. So yes, very much it has to pay very close attention to how you financial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1462,2022-10-10 10:43:20
13237," This next year, we've been just rates now up from about one and a half to maybe four and a half. That cost is going through the roof. So yes, very much it has to pay very close attention to how you finance yourself and bond markets need a bit of respect. 475, you said in Marcus, thank you. Marcus Aschworth, I think we all respect the bond market after the moves of the last couple of weeks. The moves of the last 12 months, 475, under Italian 10 year, the spreads the widest of the year so far, versus Germany. That's a significant move. Especially at a time when you have a government that wants to do more and spend more, but is constrained by not only the European Commission and what their terms are, but also with respect to the bond market right now, the bond market saying, you don't have a lot of leeway to borrow more. When does the ACB look to do something about this in a bigger way? That's the reason why I ask this question. I mean, the Bank of England, perhaps, are not looking at that situation as completely analogous. However, there is this issue that you cannot engage in quantitative tightening. And do you get, this is something we've been talking about extensively. Do you get quantitative easing and monetary policy tightness? It is bizarre. But what is the other option right now? And that's what we heard about, this idea of targeted buying. What's the political ramification for targeted buying of Italian bonds? Does Italy actually have more leeway because of what Germany is doing right now with some of their borrowing and what's going on with their energy situation? Andrew Bolls of PIMCO is going to join me a little bit later. 9.30, used the time around the opening bow. PIMCO always talk about maintaining some dry powder being the quality providers, being times of stress, not the quality demanders. I wonder if they've been buying guilt over the last month or wonder if they've stepped in to buy Italy yet? Do you buy, do you catch a falling knife, I guess, that just keeps resounding in my head because right now it has been a falling knife. But if you stepped into guilt when they ganked out, don't pretty well, haven't you? For now, although it depends on what kind of policy response there could be and what kind of proverbial margin calls there are around the world, something that I was reading a bit about over the weekend. Given them away, my line of questioning to Andrew, if you're watching. So, now I can prepare. Maybe he's got some answers. Future's down about a third of 1% on the S&P from New York.

It appears to have been the most intense missile barrage since the opening days of the war. Ukrainian officials say that energy facilities were among the targets. The attacks came after Vladimir Putin blamed Ukraine for an explosion that damaged the key bridge to Crimea. Bridge was meant to symbolize the permeance of Russia's annexation of the region. Former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke and two US-based colleagues share this year's Nobel Prize in Economics.

What the order is going to look like, how much work on the pays them and how much like the consumer is paying them and so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it and that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now and what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms and that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers.

13239," Tilly, we have gaped out in a major way. Leaser, in fact, we're trading higher above all of the QE years, 254, 254 is the spread right now. So the yield, the 10-year yield, if you look at the QE years of say, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, we were never trading up here. You've got to go all the way back to about 2013 to see the Italian yield. We've seen the spread this wide in the last couple of years, saw that in the pandemic, but for the actual yield in Italy, you've got to go back a number of years. Which really comes in the heels of a number of discussions from ECB officials, including class knot earlier today, where he was saying he sees two consecutive meetings of significant rate moves. How much is the requirement very high for them to come out in some more details about what they plan to do to support peripheral bond yields at a time when they're really seeing yields that we have not seen, as you said, in a very long time. Just remember, Euro crisis, the peak of that. I think we had a seven-handle on Italian 10-year debt. OK, sure. But when we had the whatever it takes speech in the summer of 2012, six-handle, so I just want to state that we're not at those kind of levels on Italian 10-year. How much do you look at these comparisons as valid, considering how much debt has been issued since then, at incredibly low yields that might need to get refinanced? Right? I mean, this idea that it is different to have a six or seven percent yield today, than say in 2010. I do wonder whether you've got some unique issues, though, in Europe, whereby some of these governments have done a lot of hard work over the last 10 years, particularly around the maturity profile of some of the debt. They've all locked in low interest rates, pushed them out. I hear this a lot in the credit market, too. When you actually see the stress, when does the maturity will kick in? And what you hear back from many people is not in the next 12 months. And if that's the case, then perhaps central banks can afford to go much higher before it becomes a problem, because there is this sort of built-in resiliency. It's a good point, with respect to government debt, at least in Europe. But when you're focused on Europe, just the low growth profile of the years to come, you do wonder how viable some of those models are, with 5 percent interest rates on its debt, as that starts to get, priced in a little bit more. Especially as you have to plug the gap from some of the energy crisis that a lot of these nations are facing, and you see some of the fiscal spending that's come up as a result. Bob Jorger can talk to us about energy. Do you want to say, I'm energy futures, senior strategist, and executive director, Emma Zuo. Bob, you said you're not a big believer in the OPEC, plus two million barrel production cut. What's your main point, that? Well, I think they will see only about one to 1.1, 1.2 million barrels of cuts that are actually made in this OPEC production cut deal. You'll see Saudi Arabia cut. They're good for the word. United out of Rembrandt, same thing. But there's a lot of folks in a lot of countries in OPEC that are under producing for size. They're not going to cut production further. Russia is basically around 1.3 below the existing quota going into the OPEC meeting. Nigeria was about 800,000 barrels below, and Gola was 400,000 barrels below. They're not going to cut any further, and a lot of the other participating countries are happy just to stay where they were. They're not going to go out and pull back on production today. They're just going to do their best to stay where they are. They're struggling to be where they are. So I would expect to see Saudi's cut. I would expect to see UAE cut for about 1.1 million barrels. Given the lack of spare capacity, Bob, why are prices not higher? Demand is really the issue here. I think that's another one that the OPEC folks missed a little bit. The problem is not supply. The problem is demand. We are here. The dollar is higher for starters. That is a reverse correlation to the barrel, to crude oil. Bear the dollar, the less dollar it takes to buy a barrel of crude oil. China situation is very negative for OPEC. That's a big piece of the demand puzzle that's been taken off the table. So until that comes back, we're not going to return to $130 like we were in March. But you also have the global economy teetering on the brink of global recession here. That's a demand event. Cutting barrels is not going to make a big difference there. Bob, on October 16th, the people's party congress, national congress over in China is going to kick off. And a lot of people are looking at this as a threshold moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1465,2022-10-10 10:56:18
13240," A big difference there. Bob, on October 16th, the people's party congress, national congress over in China is going to kick off. And a lot of people are looking at this as a threshold moment after which perhaps the zero-covid policy could be lifted in some capacity. What would happen if you did see a softening, especially as we've heard pushback from other officials recently about how unsustainable this policy really is? You come out and you see that red headline on the Bloomberg terminal, that's going to definitely see the price go up a little bit here. We probably would trade towards, if China's on the way back and if that's a big move in a right direction, we probably will see the market trade towards $100. But I don't see it returning to $130 where it wasn't beginning of the Ukraine crisis. So yes, that would be, that's a big piece. That would be a big demand construction event. It would be very positive for the market. But above and beyond that, with the Fed still likely to increase the rate situation by 75 basis points next meeting, 50 the one after that. I mean, they're purposely pulling back on the global economy. So it's going to leave a mark. Hey, Bob. Thank you, sir. As always, Bob Yorke there, of Mizzouo, America's. Bank of America's, my gaping on Friday after the payrolls report, Lisa, no pivot for you, no pivot for you, no pivot for you. It's a sort of the reverse Oprah Winfrey. But this was basically the message from every central central bank and Wall Street bank out there basically saying this is not going to give the Fed any ability to move away from some of the rate hiking plans. And that has been basically the theme, right? And so at what point does it really go back to the conversation that we were having at the beginning of the hour, which is how are they going to go much further than perhaps they need to in order to reign in an economy with policy that has a lag effect that isn't necessarily going to really show the consequences for a number of months if not longer. One question I've asked is whether the labor market data overstates the strength of the economy elsewhere. And most people agree with that. The labor market data looks really robust. You can find pockets of weakness all over the place. That's the reason why I wonder if earnings are going to be the main event of this week. If we see the earnings move much more quickly than we had previously expected, we see this in a number of different sectors. We've seen that from forward revisions downward for earnings guidance. There already have been revisions downward on Wall Street, but have they been enough? And if we start to see them come in more rapidly, how does that sort of be flea feed into this narrative, especially when there is the effects component, especially when there is this ability, this inability to pass along the costs that you had seen in previous months and quarters. David Costin talked about the dollar story, right, over at Goldman. And that's a 30% of all US corporate earnings derived from international sales. It's a problem, isn't it? And you're seeing this with multinational companies across the board. The RBC put out estimates of how much sales are expected to decline because of just of these things, particularly in the manufacturing sector, the industrial sectors. Future's on the S&P 500 down by around about a third of 1%. Live from New York City this morning, good morning to all David Radys coming up from Blue Bay looking forward to that conversation.

13241," So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year, that would be great, but I think it was a great feeling and being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. For a young person who now booking a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? There are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, but you're always, always learning. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will know. The fed has kind of entrenched themselves and no matter what happens, we'll do it. They're raising rates extremely quickly in order to fight inflation. Monetary policy operates with the lag, so we're waiting on those lags. We do expect the market to remain volatile. These rallies that we're seeing, we continue to expect them to fade. We are walking a nice difference between the soft and hard landing. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Habramowitz. the best. I think we start every week saying big week coming up. Big week coming up.

My horse and I'm organ standing at this to say to kick off the week.

And now other members of the Wall Street.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1467,2022-10-10 11:05:16
13242, We would like is the conclusion and the other conclusion is this has been really building on what he's been talking about all year and now other members of the Wall Street analytics community are really getting on board they're basically saying the same thing and you're starting to see on the ground evidence that they are correct with FedEx coming out on Friday yet again with some expectation of deteriorating demand you're seeing this across the board in both the tech sectors as well as the retail how much and how important is Apple going to be later this month when we start to understand how much this is not just a semiconductor story but a demand for a small electronic device story and this really will be huge for a company that is such a big proportion of the overall index. I love with the bar for them didn't we a couple of weeks ago when we came out we'd have a report and said the demand for the iPhone was faltering how many times we played that game with Apple then Apple come out on earnings day and kind of knock it out the park. So you think that basically demand isn't falling off? I'm not saying that I'm just saying we've been surprised in the past when it comes to that particular name. So this is one of the big questions that I have because what we've seen is disappointing earnings or earnings guidance has been met with incredible punishment in the stock market right we've seen incredible moves in these names are people building in the expectation that they will surprise to the upside what happens if you get a name that accounts for such a significant portion of the overall index plunge massively just in one day. The worry I have it's not around Apple it's around the FedEx as of this world and the reason I would worry about that is just how quickly the cycle seems to be moving lower based on their communication they were surprised on it they seem repeatedly surprised by it and I'm just wondering if that's going to be the theme for this. It started with Chris Harf with Walshark over for me when Chris came out a number of months ago and said wait pause that weakness you expect first half of 23 and then when we started to get this news from FedEx and other companies too he moved that forward pretty quickly pretty aggressively and so did a lot of other banks what does the Fed do with that though especially if you don't necessarily see a deceleration in core inflation which you're not necessarily going to see because again it is a lagging indicator in terms of how quickly some of these base effects can really take effect particularly with the rental rental unit component of this particular CPI reading. Rock and a hard place that wasn't a recession the base case on Wall Street yet why are we still seeing notes that say things like 40% chance and then you have this scenario analysis around the equity market and it says at the bottom like this is our base case but if we go into a recession why's that not the base case. It's a good question and what does it mean in terms of how deep that recession is remember we were discussing that somehow that's not part of the discussion anymore. Yeah exactly the other aspect of this sort of is the other side of just the question that you're asking is you're seeing sentiment at least in the surveys deteriorationatically and yet when you look at positioning people are still bullish overwhelmingly for equities or you know it really has not coheared in the same kind of way as you would expect given just how bearish sentiment has got. Futures right now down 10 points on the S&P we're down about a quarter of 1% I'll whip through the price action for you in the bond market remember the treasury market closed the Columbus Day looking at the German bond market basically unchanged on a 10 year at 220 not unchanged in Italy we'll pick up on that in just a moment Euro dollar at least like 96 handle on Euro dollar 96 94 negative a half of 1% and is this an energy story is this a question about what they have to do with respect to the Italian yields in terms of coming in with some sort of easing a lot of questions on a day where you're getting sort of then trading at least for the bond market being closed in the U.S. Today we are looking at a host of speak particularly Fed speak because when there is other events there is always Fed speak including Chicago Fed president Charlie Evans at 9am and vice vice chair Lail Brainerd at 1pm I am particularly interested to hear what Lail Brainerd has to say about some of the international concerns when does the dollar become the U.S. problem I think that's going to be a theme this week especially into earnings there's also going to be some discussions out of the ECB we heard from clouds not earlier today we do hear from chief economist Philip Lane speaking at 9am on the online ECB conference on monetary policy and John you are asking one is do we get a recession as a base case on Wall Street for the U.S. when does recession become a base case for the ECB considering that it already is the base case for for houses across Europe and across the U.S. I mean who does not think there is going to be a recession in Europe right now I think it's bizarre we go to this point where central bank forecasts are just aspirational,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1468,2022-10-10 11:09:27
13243," up and across the US, right? I mean, who does not think there is going to be a recession in Europe right now? I think it's bizarre. We go to this point where central bank forecasts are just aspirational. Seems to be what they want the data to be. And I guess they feel like if the data isn't, whether they think it's going to be in two years' time, that it's somehow a credit failure, a credibility failure, that they need to do better than they're doing. I think the other worry is the self-fulfilling aspect of it, the policy makers believe they start forecasting something. They can shape the events that they anticipate. And I understand that, but I think at this point, the Bank of England's done it, how their hands up and said, this is what I think this is going. Base case, base cases, is a recession. You'd expect the ECB to follow. And we could talk more about this and maybe it actually adds to credibility when they say it. I mean, IMF meetings, the annual meetings are kicking off. The IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC. We hear from David Malpaz in Crystalina Georgieva, later this morning and throughout the week, John. David Roddy-Johns, it's now Chief Investment Strategist at Blue Bay Asset Management. David, I've got a German Italian 10-year spread at about 255 on my screen. David, when does that get problematic for the CCB? I think it gets problematic for the ECB in terms of potentially even triggering speculation around the TPI. Once we get to spreads closer to 300 and all in yields, then would be closer to sort of 5.5% on the 10-year BTP. And I think we're a little away from that, but a kind of key is going to be the Italian budget at the end of this week. And hopefully they've taken a bit of a lesson from the experience of the UK government, where I think there's been a huge kind of policy credibility crisis in the UK. And that ultimately was the trigger for the sell-off in in-gilts and obviously that then spilled over into other markets and created problems with UK pension funds and LDI investment. But I think the key takeaway, hopefully the policy makers in Rome have taken is, you know, this is an environment where the bond market vigilantes are back and you kind of go down a fisc-reasing route or unsustainable fiscal path at your peril. Well, David, the old playbook of the last 10 years used to be, get to these levels, buy them. Buy them because the ECB's got to step in and stop them from going any higher. Have we put that playbook in the trash can? Are we doing something else now? Well, I think in terms of the so-called Eurozone periphery, then, you know, I think the ECB does really kind of take out the kind of extreme sort of left tail. I think they have indicated obviously with TPI that, you know, they will and are able to intervene to prevent that kind of sort of extreme event and sort of some kind of self-fulfilling, you know, liquidity crisis that drives up spreads to unsustainable levels. But I think we are in a regime change more generally where we've gone from a situation where the search for yield, you know, zero rates, QE infinity, men that governments could, you know, spend as they chose to spend could borrow without any considerations for the bond market. And, you know, I think the UK experiences a wake-up call that we are in a changed regime. We've kind of gone back to a situation where macro policy does matter how coherent it is. And what they've got sustainable public finances, how are you going to pay for this over the longer run? To that point, David, what will the Euro response be? Will it weaken versus the dollar strength in if the ECB comes out with some sort of cohesive plan to help control some of the rise in peripheral spreads? Well, I actually think that, you know, the Euro will weaken on that kind of scenario because potentially that also means that the ECB is going to have to kind of step back if you like in terms of either the pace or the end point for its ray heights. And also around this whole debate, around quantitative tightening. I suspect the ECB, you know, does have an eye to what's going on in terms of the periphery. And so I'd be surprised if they choose to go down the route of actual quantitative tightening. So actually actively running down their debt balance sheet at the moment, they are reinvesting.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1469,2022-10-10 11:13:11
13244," choose to go down the route of actual quantitative tining. So actually actively running down their balance sheet at the moment, they are reinvesting bonds that they hold. And that actually is providing them with some flexibility as well where they can actually kind of lean against the market while continuing in test peripheral spreads while continuing to hike rates. David, do you think QT continues at the Federal Reserve through next year? Yeah, that's a good question. I think the Fed itself, I think the constraint in terms of QT is what actually happens at the sort of in money short-end funds and money markets in the US. And what is the sort of level of reserves that is sufficiently ample for US banks? And frankly, the Fed doesn't know where that is. I don't know where that is. So I wouldn't be surprised if the level sort of reserves is higher than the Fed currently thinks. And so that does actually mean that the Fed comes to a sort of earlier end to QT. I don't think they will bring QT to an end early because it concerns around sort of money, policy, typing, or generally. Got it. David, thank you, sir.

13245," Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app. In the News and Stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third-party companies like Card dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There, Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps will surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snap, and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third-party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad-supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

Lisa just grand in lower, lower week a week. And is this because of what's going to happen with Italy and whether the ECB ends up moving away from some of their tightening plans in order to support certain yields in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal? Or is this because of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, this escalation in that war with Russia attacking Kiev overnight after the destruction of that bridge from Crimea to Russia? Good news on gas storage at a Germany, since some high numbers out of them. It looks like they've got storage to where they want it to be, going into this winter. And we've just got to sit here and hope that it's not a brutal winter, a freezing cold one, to repeat the act next year, though, without Nord Stream is going to be tough. You've made this point, and I think it is the most important point, that they have filled their storage tanks with Nord Stream gas, with natural gas from Russia. What happens when that gets taken away, especially at a time, when other methods of energy, including the nuclear power plants in France, are not producing as much as people were hoping for? Let's get to this conversation with Bloomberg, Samary Holder, and Dan and DC. I make wonderful to catch up. The President warned about the potential for nuclear armageddon in the last week. He did it, though, and Marie, at a fundraiser. And he's taken some criticism for that. Can you walk me through just how this has played out down in Washington over the last few days? He's taking criticism, because critics will say that if you're going to make this very much huge remarks about the fact that we are potentially on the verge, on the edge of Armageddon, when it comes to these massive nuclear powers, why are you doing it at the home of a Murdoch for a fundraiser, for the midterms? But we heard from Admiral Kirby over the weekend, who's the National Security Council spokesperson. He said nothing has changed. The President hasn't seen any new intel. He was just remarking on the state of play, but obviously his language was much more aggressive. Maybe the President was in front of a crowd using hyperbole, but the fact of the matter is, at the end of the day, the United States, since the very beginning, according to Jake Sullivan, has always said that Putin has brandished this weapon of tactical nuclear weapons, has said that he would do anything, potentially, to defend Russia. And they've always saw this as a concern. And that Admiral Kirby over the weekend said they're watching this incredibly closely, but nothing has changed the U.S. posture. What has changed with respect to the U.S. willingness to provide other military gear to Ukraine, especially after some of the recent incursions, the latest being the attack on Kiev? Well, the one thing the Ukrainians really want is air defense missiles. And there was a recent, at the end of September, a recent interview, Zelensky gave, and he said that those defense systems were coming from the United States. The Pentagon had talked about this a few months ago, but the delivery of that, the Ukrainians need to be trained on that. That takes not just weeks, but that takes months. And this is the systems they would need right now when you're seeing this barrage of missiles over Kiev. I spoke to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry this morning what they are seeking for from the international community is more of these types of air defense missile systems, as well as they want international community to label Russia a terrorist state. And, Marie, meanwhile, even as all of this happens, we heard over the weekend, President Biden, actually on Friday coming out, and announcing the banning of certain sales of semiconductor and chip technology to China, which some people say, is the biggest escalation between these two nations and what some are calling an economic war up to this date. Do you have a sense of why now, and how much this has really changed the backdrop? Well, officials will say that they want to cut China off now from being able to expand not just their chips, but this could, if it's implemented in a very harsh way, this could affect everything across China's economy. This could affect their military capabilities and technology. This can, in fact, the manufacturing of electric vehicles, smartphones, the list goes on, and what officials will tell you is they want to be able to blunt China's power as an economic and military menace. This could potentially be seen on the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1472,2022-10-10 11:26:26
13247," The list goes on. And what officials will tell you is they want to be able to blunt China's power as an economic and military menace. This could potentially be seen on the heels of what we saw over the summer with China having these military drills after you called Saw Speaker Pelosi go to Taiwan. But obviously this is a huge blow for, we should not just say, not just China, but also the semiconductor companies like NVIDIA, like ASML, that all their shipments and this technology goes over to China. Do you want to squeeze in some baseball banter quickly? No, no, no. Well, let's just say, poor Lisa, listen, I think I was very clueless. I think I was very classy on Twitter giving my deepest apologies to you, Muhammad Allarian, Ivan the K, but there's only one team that New Yorkers could root for this policy. What are you doing? Metz is what she said, commercial rights. Metz are going to met. They're going to get to this great point and they have all this momentum behind them and then they then they blow it. That's the met. That's metz metzing. I imagine that in DC. What are you doing? Because she come back in the next hour. No, we're done. Thank you for that classy tweet. Metz are going to met. What was classy about that? No, she said out of tweet, her deepest thoughts was basically, was her rubbing in the deepest sympathies for Metz baseball fans. What happened? They were doing so well. Did you go out and buy judge now? Well, I mean, maybe, but it's really all about the year and the potential for a bit. Or a bit patchy. Yeah, that's possible. I mean, I'm not saying cheating. What would be on the ear? Grease. Grease that would then make it a firmer grip that allows him to make balls that make the Metz look terrible. But otherwise, they would be terrific. This is worse than English football. But you start losing. You start losing, you send the referee out to check someone's ears. Sixth inning. So it already was already used up. Honestly, my boys came home last night and they were furious. They were furious about the ear. Did you see his ear? Did you or did you not see his ear? I was like, did the Metz and did you not see his ear? Would they feel better if you went and bought Aaron Judge now? I'm sure they would feel better, but I personally am not going to show out. I'm not an expert in that. No, okay. Just checking in. All right. I'm basically disgusted though. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry for your loss. I'll rub it in for you when AC Milan starts losing. We won against... I know. You've entered server a weekend. I know, but you're basically some challenges. We are. So it's going to be a great challenge. Personal and all over the place is, you know, it's always the case, isn't it? AC Milan. Well, I wouldn't see AC Milan or Blanning. Yes, futures unchanged in the yesterday. Thank you, like please save me. Few points off the top of the league. We're not too bad now. It's not what we worked 20 years ago, which is... Well, the Metz-Bonalds made it. This is a beautiful thing. We were so good 20 years ago. 1986. Metz were pretty good, too. Great in the 80s, the early 90s, 2000s. And 2010s just went really wrong. I don't know what happened.

This is Bluebird Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull farm. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've had to deal with. Bluebird Wall Street Week live tonight with Replays All Weekend on Bluebird Television and Radio. New York City this morning. Good morning to you. I'm Mark Hitchfapen. This Monday morning, the future is on the S&P 500. It's slightly negative with 10th of 1%. Down a little more than 10th of 1% on the Nasdaq 3 day losing street. Coming into Monday. In the bond market, the Treasury market closed. We'll look at the German bond market for you. 2010s and 30s to 10 years. At 2.19, about 12 months ago, I think the 10 years was a negative territory. That is a monster turned around for the German 10 years. The US government has prepared it to Italy to spread 253. At the Y to the Y and that's a problem for this Euro. Eurodollar is negative. Eurodollar is negative going into the ECB meeting. Month end, I think October 27th. For the ECB, looking potentially for a 75 basis point move. And a Euro just struggling to find any traction. So Eurodollar 97. Negative 410 to 1%. I'm struggling to understand the response of the Euro if there is some kind of move by the ECB that is hawkish. It should support the Euro in the traditional book of Central Bank policy. Does that really apply anymore? That's the dilemma of the last couple of months. You want to buy higher rights at the ECB, higher bond yields as they go into recession. That's the problem, isn't it? And what do you do with the fact that they might be hampered with respect to particularly peripheral yields? I'm watching over in the single name space. There's a semi-conductor. Because we were just talking about the potential where you end up with some sort of restriction on American technology. Exported to China. You're seeing US companies lose value. Emory was talking about this. And I find this interesting. It's not just the Chinese semi-conductor companies that are going to struggle. It will be fewer exports by the likes of NVIDIA with shares of down about 3.4% AMD. That shares down in pre-market trading at 1.3% and applied materials with those shares down a little bit more than 1%. This just adds to a year that has been the worst year for semiconductors going back to 2008. And if the losses keep up at this pace.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1474,2022-10-10 11:35:08
13249," those shares down a little bit more than 1%. This just adds to a year that has been the worst year for semiconductors going back to 2008. And if the losses keep up at this pace, you could see the worst annual loss on record. We have seen a nearly 40% decline or actually a 40% decline on these socks, right? This is the Philadelphia semiconductor index. How much does this really speak to this broader pain John that we were talking about with the likes of Apple, with the likes of other electronic device companies? And how much are these really idiosyncratic stories affected by international policy that have been doubled down upon by President Biden, restricting exports to the world's second biggest economy? Can I answer all of the above pretty much everything you said? Well, I mean, but this is going to be a huge issue considering that these are major components of the overall indexes. And how much does this really feed into some of the downward revisions of some of the S&P targets, which we've heard, even for as many of the biggest bulls on Wall Street? So, Michelle Jones is now Chief Global Strategist of Principal Asset Management, Seema ringing the bell at the Nasdaq today, buzzing for that, I'm sure. I always look up, don't you always look up around the opening, bowing people and fantically clap and wave their hands? Even when it's down, which is always kind of a strange thing. I always find that way. If we're down today, will you scream and shout and play? I'm still going to clap. You're still going to clap, even a bit down, OK? She's paid opportunities to buy. There you go. Is that going to be your story whilst you're here? The opportunities to buy this? Are on-today? No. No, I would say I think there's worse to come for the market, unfortunately. You know, you talk about... We talk all this time about the ferd about inflation, about growth, and then you add in all these additional geopolitical pressures. It's very difficult to find anything to be positive about at the moment. And a lot of these things, I don't think, is fully priced into the market either. Earning seasons, of course, is going to be really interesting. We are expecting to see weakness starting to really feed through now. A lot of the narrative about March and Precious, but also just generally starting to feel the pressure of consumers potentially putting back from next year. So there's a lot, I think, to be concerned about from investors. When you say it's not priced yet, and if everything you've just said, what isn't priced? I still think that the recession is not priced. Right? So I think the market is... Eventually, I mean, it keeps switching every few days, but I think generally speaking, the market is coming to terms with the idea that rates are going to go higher and they're going to stay there for longer as well. The bit that the market is still playing around with is this recession. You know, a lot of people still thinking that soft landing is possible. We think it's very unlikely. And with recession, unfortunately, does come. And it's recession. So which aspects of the market are not sufficiently priced? Because some people might look at retail, for example. They might look at some of the semi-conductors, and they'll say, recessions priced there. Where is it not, or is it even the 40% decline on semi-conductors that has not fully appreciated the depth of this downturn, not just whether there will be a technical recession? So, like you said, I think there are segments of the market which really have struggled. And semi-conductors have been one of them. Unfortunately, the latest news probably suggests that they could be further down, down with movement from there. So valuations at this kind of stage, they are instructive, but they're not going to tell the full story. So in the same way in the last five to ten years, we've known that valuations are very expensive, but it hasn't stopped market from going up. Cheap valuations don't necessarily mean that markets are not going to go down further. I was reading a piece of research over the weekend, which was talking about how, if you look at some of the A.A.I. sentiment, it looks really bearish. People say they're feeling terrible. Things are going to go down. And then you look at their actual positioning, and they're still pretty invested in equities. They're still actually fairly bullish, at least, in terms of their positioning. What's the trigger to wash that out? So I think, I'm not sure if you're going to see necessarily a washing out, because even from today, we are expecting further declines. But the one question that keeps coming up, I've been traveling around the US in the last week, the one question keeps coming up is like, but when is this floor going to come? When can I start buying? So that is the question that people are trying to figure out. When is the timing for them to increase their exposure? And I think at this stage, if we look at historical bear market cycles, your average downfall is 27%. Now, if you're down 24% and you don't think this is going to be like the GFC, then more than halfway there. So if you're not already underweight, this is probably not the time to start reducing even further. What do they ask you about Europe when you talk about this country? How much do they hate that market right now? So much, but I understand that and actually, I fully agree with that perspective for Europe. It is a very, very challenging time, and I think that what we're starting to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1475,2022-10-10 11:40:04
13250," market right now. So much, but I understand that and actually I fully agree with that perspective for the Europe. It is a very, very challenging time and I think that what we're starting to see in the US is they are understanding that actually in Europe the situation is considerably worse. And put on top of that is there's so many things that we cannot predict. We're not meteorologists. We cannot predict what the weather's going to be. Sure. No one in the whole world can predict what's going on in Putin's head. So with those two incredible uncertainties, despite European valuations being so cheap, this is probably not the time to increase your exposure when you have those two things hanging over you. You talked about the persistence of this, particularly around raids that we could be living with this for the next 12 months or so. Then that's also a conversation taking place much more so in Europe now that we could be living with this for more than one winter, maybe two perhaps even longer. When you start to think about the United States in that respect, 10 years ago we talk about the United States decoupling for the mess that was playing out in Europe. Is that still the case? Would you say that's still the case? I think it is to some extent. I mean, one of the things that we are studying to fill is that in the US there is this belief that there is a complete decoupling. But of course that doesn't happen. Whatever European tensions there are, whatever the energy situation is, they will be leakage into the US. In Europe, you're already seeing this huge substitution from natural gas towards oil. And of course there will be inevitable repercussions for the US as well. So I don't think it's a full decoupling. I think the US does come out better than Europe, but suddenly not a complete decoupling. Okay, so bear with me. But everyone who I know is going to Europe for a vacation, including Tom Kean, who is over in Europe right now. And we're hearing about the negative effect from the strong dollar on US companies. But that's because things are on sale effectively from, say, European industrial. So when is the currency differential a good thing for Europe the way it used to be, say, five years ago when the currency wars were reversed? Well, I think you've already seen some of that play out this summer, which is why you haven't seen Europe in GDP actually contract yet. If you look at Spain, Italy, all of the southern European countries have benefited significantly from the weak currency. And that is going to moderate a little bit some of the downturn that Europe is going to feel. But this is, I mean, from an investment perspective for the US, it's one of the key reasons why we've been overweight midcaps rather than large cap. The mid cap exposure to domestic is significantly higher than what you see for large cap. And they've outperformed and we expect them to continue to outperform. One theme that we've heard from a lot of the investors who we speak with is it's starting to look attractive to go into longer dated bonds. How much conviction do you have around that kind of view, both in the US, but also in places like Europe? So we have, for example, increased our exposure to long dated bonds fairly significantly in the last two months. A couple of reasons one is we are, as I said, expecting recession to hit next year and in that environment, typically you should see down with pressure on yields. But like you said, in Europe, there's the added pressure. What is central banks doing? They're raising rates, but they're also pushing down the long end. Or at least they're trying to push down the long end. At some point there's going to be some kind of success or at least it's going to stop any further movement. So if you have to be anywhere in the yield curve, I would rather be on the long end than the short end for sure. In the gilt market or treasuries? I don't think you want to be in the UK. I asked the question because you're based in London. I just wondered whether you've been buying gilts in the last couple of weeks. We did not foresee what was going to happen to the gilt market, like anyone else, I think. Just generally speaking, the UK we have serious concerns about the fiscal story is not going to improve, I think, as much as they can walk back. There are certain segments of that political story, the fiscal story that they're going to stick to. So if you're looking at a longer term horizon, the UK has a worse inflation problem, it's going to a worse growth problem. So if I had to pick one over the other, I would pick the US. Halloween budget, what do you want from that? As an economist, I want them to unwind everything. Unwind everything. Just go back to having some serious fiscal policy where they're trying to actually balance the budget. In the same way that really in the UK, unlike many other countries, fiscal balancing is a hallmark of fiscal policy for the last two decades. So for them to walk away from it at this time is a very difficult time. In two or three years time, who knows, trickle down economic economics could work. Do you think that everyone in the UK right now you ask them about what's going on with the gilt market and they just sort of sigh and look at you like, please, can I just disappear right now? By the gilt market. That sort of... Someone did buy the gilt market and made a tremendous amount of money. Can I just say that when the bank even stepped in and...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1476,2022-10-10 11:44:09
13251," I am looking at you like please can I just disappear right now by the guilt market. That's sort of someone did buy the guilt market made a tremendous amount of money. Can I just say that when the bank giving them stepped in and you've dropped by what a hundred basis points at one point in that day. Which is the reason why I mean to see him as point the reason why the long end perhaps is getting some credence or some conviction on people because they do believe eventually central banks will step in at least for that because of some of the structural issues that require some sort of. Without them stepping in at some point you'd have to believe bond start behaving like bonds going into an economic downturn. People have gotten wrong what that point is though again and again and we have seen people change their expectations for how high yields could go and at this point I think there's a feeling of being shaken a bit about what is the base at this point after a world of zero rates for so long. Massively zero confidence in a high volatility world zero confidence. Complete lack of conviction. Thank you. That's what he gives out been at the first and so long you think if it wereagahit insights maybe that's our idea, they don't know how to stay seaweed or they don't know today in the most intense barrage since the early days of the invasion. And Vladimir Putin threatened further attacks warning that the action would be harsh. That came after Putin blamed Ukraine for an explosion that damaged a key road and rail bridge connecting Crimea with Russia. Ukraine hasn't acknowledged it was responsible.

Recovery is a win and how you get fit or faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating the way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a morade.

What we're seeing is that the dollar is causing a lot of problems globally in emerging markets and elsewhere.

Steve Englander there, the global head of G10 FX research over a standard childhood. Live from New York City this morning, good morning, Lisa Bramett, Jonathan Ferro, TK back with us in a couple of days. Let's get you some price action briefly on the S&P 500 slightly negative with down 2.10% of 1% yields up almost the basis point in Germany 220 on the German 10 year Euro dollar breaking down here 96 94 down a half of 1% Lisa, that's a week of Euro. And how much is this because of what's happening with the acceleration in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia and how much is this just because it seems like the UECB is even more in between a rock and a hard place than the Federal Reserve with respect to not being able to tighten as much because of concerns about peripheral yields and we see that with yields rising today pretty significantly. They meet again in about two weeks time. Let's stay on this story and head over to Bloomberg's Maria today outstanding by with a special guest. Hey Maria. Jess, we are joined, of course, by the Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of Cigarette Cag. And you know, we talk about energy and the European economy every day on the show, but today we have to talk about Ukraine because.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1478,2022-10-10 11:51:59
13253," and finance minister, a cigarette cag. And, you know, we talk about energy and the European because we saw this morning, essentially a country that was blitzkrieked almost by Russia. Not just a politician, but a European, how does that make you feel? How do you respond to that? The horrific, the indiscriminate shelling of innocent civilians, cities constitute real violations, tangible violations of international law, humanitarian law, and I've heard the committee already speak of war crimes, but our heart goes out to the people of Ukraine, and it's also very clear that there will not be broken, nor that of NATO or the European Union. We need to stand firm with Ukraine, particularly and even more so on the face of such cruelty and such war violations. And when you say we need to start firm with Ukraine, does it mean sanctions, stay put, maybe they go in Krashendo, that that support financially will also materialize not just on weapons, but the cash they say they need? Well, they, on all levels, politically, militarily, financially, the humanitarian support, there is one front. It's a European front, and of course, our NATO allies to make sure that the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people get what they need in order to withstand these atrocities. And of course, as we reported today, what they want is air defense systems and Russia also branded as a terrorist state, but going into the impact that this has to in Europe, because we can feel it pretty much every day in the cost of living, food, crisis, inflation, energy bills. When you look at this blackmail in the hands of Russia, how do you respond to this economically? How can you alleviate some of the pressures if you can? Well, we do need to alleviate. We do need to also invest, of course, in support our own citizens, particularly because it can't be that the outcome of this war will be that our population is suffering, that they feel they might be a loss of support for this righteous effort to support peace and security and international law, standing by the people of Ukraine, so it can't be. So we need to make money available. We need to have the right support packages as we have been doing, each country in their own way, but often in a coordinated manner, because our own populations also need to be able to get through winter, and the response to blackmail can never be that we give in. And you mentioned the coordination, and that takes me perfectly to my next question. There has been over the past week a lot of debating Europe about national measures are great, but not everyone has the same physical capacity. It's not a secret that Germany created all of tension with this 200 billion-Europe package, and there are no calls that perhaps has married new tools or a form of joint response. Will you look at it from the Dutch perspective? How do you look at this? Well, no fairness. We've also recently announced the very generous additional package in support of households and a small to medium-term enterprises, and it's a temporary set of interventions, as is desirable by, for instance, the ECB or the IMF. If you support, if you help, do it tangible, do it targeted, and make it time-bound. But I also acknowledge that, of course, the pockets of every country are different. The physical space for every country is different. But many countries have undertaken similar measures, sometimes earlier, and you can't compare them one-on-one. But we've been trying to do as ministers of finance, and of course, also in the informal meeting in Prague, the prime ministers, to see what we can do together, where the means can be found, and how we can take a longer-term view, because this crisis will be with us for quite some time. And the market, however, they're looking at potentially something that may not be a recovery fund, but may see, well, a joint action, or actions backed by the European Union's triple-A rating. Is that something that you would contemplate? Well, from the Netherlands so far, we've said there's a lot of money available in the different funds that we've created for other crises. I mean, the Rekona Recovery Fund, Repower EU's a recent one that also accelerates the energy transition. There are billions and billions of funds available that have yet to be allocated. Let's look at that first, and let's see what our joint course of action will be. And at the same time, we often, we always call for national government action, where that's feasible. At the same time, we need to look towards debt sustainability, not just of our own country, but of the eurozone as a whole. And that takes me to a final question that will be another point of debate here in the end of your area, which is debt to GDP. The idea was 60 percent. Defisible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1479,2022-10-10 11:56:48
13254," as a whole. And that takes me to a final question that will be another point of debate here in the Euro-area, which is debt to GDP. The idea was 60 percent, deficit below 3 percent. By now, it's almost clear that some countries are not going to get to those levels in a long time. And in a moment in time where you have to also invest in your own security, is that even doable? Are these targets, and should we even take them seriously anymore? Well, the three to 60 percent are matters that are vested in the treaty. As focused from my perspective, we've said that as the Netherlands and jointly with Spain, let's see what are credible debt reduction pathways that can be worked out at a national level and at the same time look towards the reforms that are required that have been lagging and the investments that have often not taken place. In moments of crisis, we need to keep our eye on the ball. Think long-term, but at the same time, we need to make sure that when you agree to a debt reduction pathway tailored to your national economic and fiscal space, we also need to make sure that there's effective oversight that if one doesn't align with the agreement set for oneself, that there are other measures. So it's a balancing act, and I'm looking forward to the bill conversation once the Commission publishes its proposals end of this month. And this will be a real balancing act, especially as we see some of the yields jump across Europe. Minister, thank you so much for your time. I always appreciate it. And I'm good to see you on Bloomberg TV. Jonathan. I'm Maria. Thank you. Wonderful work, as always. I'm going to share on the latest, I promise you that number a little bit earlier, on German gas storage, the level at 94.07% as of October 10th, according to the regulator. It's always interesting to listen to them, talk about the need for oversight on economic matters when it comes to the budget. And then when it comes to the observed foreign policy mistakes made by countries like Germany that many other European nations have to pay for as well, this goes missing. I just think that it sounds a little bit hypocritical sometimes compared to where we were 10 years ago when the mistakes were made on the periphery and other mistakes have been made in the call. We seem to be having a very different conversation. That's why I wonder it'll be interesting whether this time around when there is some desire for lower yields in Italy, when there is some desire to perhaps loosen up the budget, whether there'll be a bit more openness on the part of the German members of the European project, just exactly to that point. What do you think the Spaniards, the Spanish might have something to say about whether you should outsource economic security to China, energy security to Russia, defense to the United States? I'm sure that they will have something to say and you're already seeing the pushback with respect to German popularity within the block. From New York, this is Blaineback. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities.

Now there's another issue that shows a risen, which is called gamification, which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification. It's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. You will put a woman on Mars.

The Fed is on the one way free trade and they're moving very quickly. We're going to see growth slowing and we're going to hear from a pretty tone that Fed that they're going to continue to raise rates. We haven't seen the significant tightening yet. The Fed is lagged because they have to wait for the body of evidence of the data to come in. End of the year, though, he thinks that that's when the Fed is going to stop and pause and sort of look around and assess this situation. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Coming up this week, CPI, some bank earnings and some out of day IMF forecast. Life from New York City this morning. Good morning. Good morning from our audience worldwide. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Lisa Abramowitz. I'm Jonathan Farrow. TK will be covering those out of date IMF forecast a little bit later this week. That's not the promo. Tom will give you the promo in a few days time. I'm looking at equity down about two tenths of 1% on the S&P. I'm looking at a guilt market. Lisa breaking down yields up and a way. And it goes back to what we were talking about early in the show. This idea that they did move forward the UK treasury and the bank of England. Their plans to really extend some of the support for the market and then to release some of those projections early. Will that help? And the fact that the market is pushing back and suggesting maybe not is really a problem, especially for these pension plans. I do like the sequencing now. It's better. This is what we all wanted. So I can't complain too much this morning. We wanted the budget and the forecast to come before the bank of England. So the bank of England could fold that into their own forecast and then calibrate policy effectively appropriately. I think we're all just waiting to see what October 31st brings now. They're the new dates if you're just tuning in. So on Halloween, we get a budget from the UK together with the office of a budget responsibility to have been there forecast and a couple of days later. Lisa, we're here from the B O E. You asked Marcus Ashworth, what does the market want? Because if this does not get delivered in the way that they want, that the markets will not respond well. And what they want is basically to push out some of the expected support that the trust administration has said even as.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1481,2022-10-10 12:05:10
13256," push out some of the expected support that the trust administration has said, even as the administration comes out and says that they are going to increase some of the support, for example, with inflation-adjusted pension payments and things of these natures. How are they going to pay for it, given that the pushback has really come from the bond for Gelandes? Currently at this point, without the support of the central banks as they continue to raise interest rates, I think, Priya Misra. Was it Priya Misra of TD? Then they said the Fed will be continued to be tone-deaf and keep on hiking. We want fiscal discipline. It's funny about the situation in the UK. They have been widely criticized by pretty much everyone under the sun about the policies that this chancellor came out with in the last couple of weeks. But as Mark Asashworth of Bloomberg Appendian pointed out, in 12 months' time, when many of these economies are in recession, some of these policies will be the policies that a lot of people are pushing for. And this really raises an interesting point about how much fiscal response can actually offset the duration of the downturn that's to come. Some people say, well, in 12 months' time, there will be more appetite for it. Other people saying yields will still be high. You will still have high inflation, perhaps not. And this really goes to the heart of the reason why some people are saying this recession, this downturn might not end that quickly. This is the more-conceit-only view of things. Sure. Because of this sort of lack of a fiscal response that we are expecting based on where yields are. A lack of any response, typically, and we talked about this last week, you would have some form of counter-sicklical circuit breaker. Can't come from fiscal right now because of what Guy Johnson called feet-brow markets. Can't come from monetary policy because the objective is to tighten financial conditions and get inflation lower. Where does it come from? And some people are saying maybe a productivity shock. But a lot of people don't really have a good answer to this, which is the reason why you're hearing more of an L-shaped recovery. We heard that from Ellen Zettner last week, and that raises this issue of how much people can get confidence over longer term returns. And the reason why bonds are looking better to people. Yields up in the UK on a 10-year-by-15 or 16 basis points on a 30-year right now by 22. Let's whip through the price action for you. Future is a negative 2-10s of 1% on the S&P in the German bond market, yields higher by a basis point or so. Pretty muted price action over there. The Treasury market, of course, closed today, stateside. Crude down a half of 1%, 92 dollars, 92 dollars after a monster rally through last week on WTI and Euro-dollar. $96.96, 96, and 96 handled on the Euro-Lisa. We're negative a half of 1%. And that pain. Where is it coming from today? Is it because of the acceleration or the exacerbation of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia? Is it because of what's happening in Italy? Is it because of the prospects of possibly a difficult winter? I mean, what's on the margins going to cause this to shift one way or another? Toxic brew. Nodes of disapproval. Toxic brew. Nodes of discomfort. The head of US fixed income research over at Morgan Stanley. Vichy financial conditions tightening. We're looking at companies that, in some cases, are struggling to get the finance they might like across the economy. Vichy, we've talked a lot about monetary policies rolled in all of this. Do you think something else is going on? Absolutely, I think. You know, clearly it is right for us to talk about the continued policy tightening from the monetary policy perspective. I think it's also important to see what else is happening. At the same time as monetary policy is tightening, regulatory policy, particularly on banks by the Fed on the large gap US banks, he's also tightening. You know, what we took away from the C-CAR stress test is effectively a capital call on some of the large banks that effectively translates it to very substantial pressure on the risk-weated assets that banks hold. And dealing with risk-weated assets means that the banks will have to either do less of what they're doing or choose to lend less, to focus on some sectors, de-efficize some other sectors, do something else, all of which translates into lower credit formation and greater illiquidity and less of ability of the banks to step in when they need to disintermediate during market dislocations. How much is this offset by all of the private investors, by all of the big firms out there that are not banks that have really emerged as primary lenders? It's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1482,2022-10-10 12:09:57
13257," by all of the private investors, by all of the big firms out there that are not banks that have really emerged as primary lenders. It's a little bit of an offset but not a sufficient offset. A large number of these private firms, non-banking lending, ultimately does require look to their exit in the form of securities, alternatives to that. A lot of those vehicles still require banks to provide the senior leverage by buying the senior branches of these types of securities products. That's again a major challenge. We're seeing that in every market that relies on bank participation to provide senior leverage. You're seeing spread stay wide and stay sticky. There's another dimension to this conversation. Given what you said about, banks in ability to step in. Who's holding the bag when things get really bad? Who has this exposure? Can we talk about that just a little bit more? Because at least when I've gone over this over the last few months through much of this year, we've just unwound about 10 years. A decade's worth of stimulus in some cases, zero rate, negative rates. It's all gone. Trillions of worth of QE. It's all gone. The bond market bubble, it's blown up. Vischem is still trying to work out who's holding the bag. Where's the leverage? Where's it sitting? It's a hard question to answer, John. I think we found out from the two weeks ago with the response from the guilt market, is that this type of dislocation could very quickly translate into forcing a policy you turn both from the fiscal side and to some extent on the part of the on the monetary policy side of, you know, central bank intervention. All of that points to potential for an accident is certainly high. Vischee, is this bullish or bearish for credit? I mean, on one hand, it's bearish because it could lead to a widening of spreads, a lack of lending at the potential for more and softened season. The other hand, it signals a policy response that right now seems like it's not on the table. It's not on the table. I think we are on the on the margin, we are bearish credit in the sense that spread, we are looking for a premium to get wider. But I want to be distinguished between one of the spreads and yields. The front end of the industry and the curve certainly showing attractive enough yields, but you know, in a world of broadly bearish outlook for risk assets across the board, relative shelter is in the front end of the industry curve. Vischee, wonderful to hear from you, sir, just a final one from me, 75, nailed on for you and the team at the face next meeting. Does CPI matter this week? Probably not, in my opinion, I would expect, if our expectations of CPI hold, 75 is on. Vischee, to the picture of Morgan Stanley, Vischee, thank you, mate. As always, good to catch up, buddy. 75, nailed on seems to be the take from most people we speak to at a moment, Lisa, for the feds next move. There is, though, descent around the margins, there is a shift in tone away from the fed needs to keep going incredibly aggressively, though, what with their way behind the curve, an increasing number of people who kind of agree with Tom Porcelli and believe this feeling that perhaps things are moving much faster, much more quickly, than the hard data is suggesting and the fed might be over tightening. And this is new, and I'm hearing this from more people out there that that could be a policy error on the other side. I wonder if we start to see this on the committee at any time soon. Have all been sharing the same speech over the last month or so, whether we start to see that descent start to grow just a little bit more and show up in the in the minutes and elsewhere? It's a great question, because right now we're hearing a very cohesive message and perhaps this is to try to regain some credibility, but we're going to be speaking with Bill Dudley coming up and he put out a column that really seems to echo what Mohameda-Larian was saying over the weekend, which is the Fed made a mistake and it needs to acknowledge its policy errors that is the cause of the reason why they have to go as hard as they do in terms of tightening policy now, and that if they're more transparent with that, it might regain the credibility that they need to make the steps necessary to bring this economy into the right way. He wants a mere culpr from the Fed to reserve to explain why they've had to do 300 basis points worth of tightening at six months and possibly 400 basis points in nine. I get it. Bill is also asking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1483,2022-10-10 12:14:05
13258," To explain why they've had to do 300 basis points worth of tightening at six months and possibly 400 basis points in nine. I get it. Bill is also asking to convey more clearly the amount of pain that people should expect in the economy as well. I think it's very difficult to wish you a mere culper and then say, oh, by the way, there's going to be a lot of pain because of what we did. Those two things make things even more uncomfortable for this Fed. But perhaps it will achieve the outcome that they want. This is the perverse aspect of it. It will achieve the outcome that they want more quickly that if the market still doesn't buy that they have conviction in what they're doing. Coming up, Bill Dudley, formally at the New York Federal Reserve and now Bloomberg opinion columnist this morning, he says the Federal Reserve owes the world a mere culper.

Here's one for you from Bill Dudley, the headline of his latest piece, The Federal Reserve owes the world a mea culpa. Bill Dudley, Bloomberg opinion columnist and former New York Fed president, a good friend of this program as well, joined us right now. Bill, let's start there. A mea culpa. What do you want that to look like? I think the Fed needs to explain to the world what went wrong. Why are we having to raise rates off 400 basis points this year, 4 percentage points this year? That's a huge amount of tightening of short career time. And is evidence that the Fed was very late. The Fed made a couple of mistakes. Number one, how they implemented their 2% average inflation regime. They basically tied their hands and said we can't raise rates until a whole bunch of things happen. Number two, they made some important forecasting errors both on inflation and on the tightness of the labor market. I think doing a mea culpa is important to basically build the Fed's credibility for the future. If you don't admit error, how can you be confident that the central bank won't make a whole another mistake next time? Bill, do you think they can do both that and do something which you asked them to do a number of weeks ago, which is to be much more open about the pain that this country, this economy is about to go through? And I wonder if they do both. You say it enhances credibility. Do you think it also invites questions about whether it should retain its independence? Well, I think you want the central bank to retain its independence because you don't want monetary policy to be politicized. If monetary policy becomes politicized, you're going to have even worse monetary policy that we've gotten over the last couple of years. Bill, on the flip side, there is an increasing chorus of big names saying that the Fed is moving to make a policy error on the other side. By raising too far that a deep recession is not an inevitability, but will be the consequence of them raising rates as much as they're expected to raise rates. Are you sympathetic to that view? Well, I think that's a logical outcome of being very slow to tighten in the first place. There's been slow to tighten and you have to do a lot to catch up. If you do a lot to catch up, you may not notice that you've done more than that's actually sufficient. I think hard landing is very likely because the labor market has gotten too tight. The Fed needs to push the unemployment up significantly and that's likely to lead to a recession. I think it's almost inevitable at this point. What's the economic benefit to the Fed coming out and being honest and saying what John was pointing out is a very difficult message to swallow, which is we've made mistakes. Oh, and by the way, we're going to necessarily make a mistake on the other side. Tighten into a hard landing. What does that give them in terms of credibility that can actually help meeliorate the cycle? Well, I think that they are not going to say that we're going to tighten on purpose to generate a recession. I don't think you'd ever expect a central bank to say that, but I do think, you know, Powell has now endorsed the notion that there is going to be some pain involved. I think what the Fed has not done though is admitted how do we get into this mess in the first place. And I think that's the part of the message that the Fed needs to send to markets to build their credibility for the future. A bill credit to you. I remember doing a panel with you in Muhammad Al-Aryan back in June, maybe May of 2021. And you were both making this point that the Fed needs to appreciate some two-way risk here perhaps start by pulling back on QE. That would have meant maybe going six months earlier than they actually did Bill. What difference would six months have made you think? I think this the advantage of going earlier is you wouldn't have to go as fast. And you have more ability to assess the effects of your actions. Right now they have to get to take very quickly and given the lot long legs of monetary policy, this increases the risk that they overdo it. If you spray out the monetary policy, tighten over longer period of time, you have more time to assess the impact of your actions. You've talked Bill about how you could see a peak Fed funds rate north of five percent. The market is coming to your view. You were out front that way. Right now in the market, we have a nearly 4.7 percent terminal rate for next year. Where have you changed your view on where you think the Fed has to go in order to bring in inflation and honestly address some of the flaws of the previous thinking? I don't think it's so much as the peak in rates has to be higher.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1486,2022-10-10 12:27:30
13261," the Fed has to go in order to bring in inflation and honestly address some of the flaws of the previous thinking. I don't think it's so much as the peak in rates has to be higher. I think the fact is the Fed has to hold that peak for a longer period of time. I think the Fed's strategy here is not to just keep hiking regardless of what's happening in terms of the real economy, but I think they want to go to a restrictive policy and then they want to hold it there until they see clear signs that's actually bringing inflation down and generating more slack in the U.S. level market. Bill, wonderful to catch up. Great read, as always, and good to have you on the program with us this morning. Bill Dutty there, the former New York Fed president, and now of course Bloomberg opinion columnist amongst other things. Least you're just a tough one, isn't it? He's not the only one saying this, but if they do that, they come out, issue a me a culper, say we got it wrong. Can you imagine how many more Senator Warren's around there as the economy starts to roll over? And I think if you focus too much on the Fed or reserve, you're not focusing enough on some of the fiscal errors that were made over the last couple of years as well. Agreed. In terms of additional rounds of stimulus that may not have gone to exactly the efforts that perhaps really helped re-reinit the economy, but just simply gave people money to spend at a time when the economy wasn't open. Lots of discussions that might be superseded by someone looking to blame someone, right? So this is why I asked, what is the economic benefit coming out and saying we were wrong and we're going to be wrong again because we have to create some sort of stability here. This is the rock in the hard place and the reason why policymakers do not usually come out and say we're heading toward a recession and it's our fault. I understand the argument that it enhances credibility. And to trust the process, you've also got to believe that the people in control understand when they've made a mistake so they don't repeat them. Makes perfect sense to me. But I just think that it's more too way that you also invite a lot of criticism about the path forward. The one argument and this is something buildedly said in the past is if there is more credibility, perhaps the market will move more in tandem with what the Fed is saying and then you might get a more accurate read-through of policy. It's the hopeful. Yes, we got it, right? Sure, no, I understand. It reaches down two tenths of 1% from New York. This is Blinkback. I think she pal said things that were indefensible.

You just, yeah, even though that voice in your head is saying, oh god, I'm so tired, I don't wanna do this. You gotta show up. You gotta be charmingly relentless. You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line to success at the kind of all over place. And you have to just be able to work through those things.

The 221 on a 10 year, the spread between Italy and Germany this morning through 250 basis points in and around the wider the year at 2.53. The Italian 10 year up by 4 basis points at 4.74. So the euro weaker by a third of 1% euro, $1.97. 13. And how much lower could it go? And you know you were talking just a bit ago about the euro crisis and all of the parallels that we're seeing at what point does this become a really difficult moment that requires a more extreme intervention. And what could that intervention be at a time when all responses are called into question in a new inflationary regime? Whatever it takes summer 2012, six handle, full handle right now. Hard to compare the two areas, the two bond markets, apples to apples not quite, but gives you an idea of where we are now versus where we were then. And then this goes to how much can this particular debt cycle withstand a 6% rate. And I get your point that a lot of companies and a lot of nations have pushed out majorities. Is that good enough? Resilience. Right. Don't you see that word everywhere? Everywhere. In South Side research resilience. Resilience. More resilient than it was. Is it just delayed? Is it delayed reaction? Is it delayed? Is it delayed? She'll know I was going to join us now. Feels like euro crisis all over again, except it's different. Chief economist, the Axe of Investment Managers, so let's start there. Let's just start with the key differences between what we face in now and what we face back then. Well, first of all, at the time we had massive external imbalances in the periphery. We had massive current again deficits. So you had an issue with the government, but you had an issue with the way the entire colony was working in the south of Europe. You don't have that now. Those countries have really done a good job at restablishing a proper external position. The other big differences that we have different instruments. The big issue we had in 2010 and 2011 is that there was nothing in the arsenal that you could use to actually stop this. We didn't have the SM. We didn't have an ECB, which after that has proved its flexibility. So there was this scrambled to finding institutional solutions in just a matter of month. Now, at least we know that we can rely on those emergency mechanisms if things get to the point that we need to use them. And I think the market knows it, and that explains it's one of the reasons why we haven't seen for instance a lot of contagion moving away from Italy and affecting other countries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1488,2022-10-10 12:35:49
13263," It knows it and that explains it's one of the reasons why we haven't seen for instance a lot of contagion Moving away from Italy and and and and affecting other countries in the south. We know that the instruments are there They came up with OMT we're dragging the summer of 2012 and the beauty of our MTS It never got activated never had to be used this summer they came up with TPI the transmission protection instrument Is that right? TPI? Okay, when does TPI start to become a real consideration? 250 basis points of spread right now I'm just trying to what wonder what's the threshold when that starts to kick in they've never been clear on this And they don't want to be clear on this. I'm talking about the ECB obviously. There's a lot of discretion there And I guess is that It's not just the case of the level of the spread or the level of interest rates is the speed at which things are are moving and so far It's been fairly contained the biggest issue for me with TPI is actually not of the technical nature. It's it's political The way TPI has been designed it's definitely not Done in a way that would protect the governments against its own mistakes And that's the issue if you could come up with a situation where the market is punishing a state for things which has not even done or Announced then TPI is probably there if a government is doing stuff which is triggering or sort of rational reaction By the market then TPI is probably another right instrument and then you need to go to to empty But so far at least the news that we have from Italy, which is near the biggest issue in there It's that the government the new government. We don't have one yet But the noises we got from the new majority is that they want to be prudent So if they don't do if they don't make big policy announcements that would make the ECB nervous They could actually benefit from TPI and there's a relationship with the market that you can build on that I just can hear your voice in my head right now Well, so I can hear Jonathan you're saying yeah, you're mind-riding in China because it's very loud right now And he's saying okay, so they're gonna talk about political risk and the peripheries What about the fact that Germany is the biggest risk right now to the entire European economy and some of these programs? I got an Easter at the two things so there you go So what's the what's the answer? How is this situation different both with the political considerations and From just distinguishing from the euro crisis of 2010 Considering that Germany is one of the biggest problems one of the biggest downside risks to the entire economic outlook Germany is you clearly one of the biggest downside risks to to the macro story But it's also the country which is the widest policy space and they are using their policy space quite a lot I mean you've seen the announcements that we we had last week from front of the German government The steel can mitigate a lot of the current pressure that they get from from from guys prices With the billions that they are about to to spend so in this case Yes, it's quite negative the last two three quarters Recession in Germany is absolutely invoitable I think at this stage But we know that they can do deal with this on their own forces Which is not something that we have in other countries. That's the big difference Although you do have to wonder how much higher inflation is going to be for a longer period of time given the fiscal response in Germany And that the political pressure from the peripheral regions will say if you guys can have such a big fiscal response We can too because you're just let us you know suffer as we finance your deficit by bringing down the cost of Your your financing through a weaker euro a key shoe there I think is Whether all this triggers another round of debt neutralization in Europe, which is definitely what we need to see when we have a pandemic We ended up with debt mutualization. It was partial obviously was the next generation pack that we did it I'm a bit surprised and disappointed that we haven't seen more progress on that another round of debt Mentralization to deal with the fill out from the Ukraine war But there is going to be a point where we will get there I mean Europe is always know Tiring for for external observers because it takes so much time to get to the right solutions But I'm quite convinced that if we get to a situation where we will see bigger cracks appearing in our fabric You will see this further movement of debt realization you will see actually a capacity From the EU as a entity to provide support to the most fertile countries We've done this with Italy with the next generation pack false and being it's not done to deal with the full out of the Ukraine war But I really have no doubt that we would get there if need be let's talk about the cracks right now The mystery for many of us",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1489,2022-10-10 12:40:13
13264," deal with the full out of the Ukraine war, but I really have no doubt that we would get there if need be. Let's talk about the cracks right now. The mystery for many of us, the ECB, why is it not forecasting a recession? How on earth are they not forecasting recession in the Eurozone? I was very surprised and then I reminded myself of my time when I was in central banking. You probably don't want to be the one validating market expectations of the recession. You probably don't want to add to the general bleakness in the system by coming up with a very scary forecast. I guess it's part of what central banks usually do. I noticed that in the US the Fed has taken a no full enough time before saying that yes, maybe an employment would have to rise to get inflation back into control. Well, it should be the same in Europe. Central banks very rarely want to be at the bottom of the distribution when it comes to forecasts. And I'm not sure except that there is a credibility issue that the central banks will go through with the tightening plans that they're projecting because casual observers would say, well, you put A plus B together, you get recession. And they're saying, no, no, no, A plus B equals roses and lots of beautiful things. So at what point does that undermine the faith that they will continue with their tightening cycle? Well, they don't deny the risk of the recession to be fair. We didn't have a super rosy message coming from the ECB. But they're in a complicated position because that's a big difference with the US. Inflation in Europe is not or is not essentially domestically driven. It's not a lot of fault to summarize. And we have the new CB which is forced into tightening to keep inflation expectations anchored in a situation of massively adverse supply side shock. It's not an easy thing to explain, especially if we've spent the last 20 years, not just in Europe but also in the US, explaining to stakeholders in the real economy, also in the markets that you don't want central banks have your back. At this time, no, sorry, central banks cannot have your back because there's an inflation issue, there's an inflation expectations issue. And central banks are not going to be your friend. It's incredibly complicated to explain again coming after 20 years of military policies which have been extraordinarily accommodative. It delaying the inevitable though, aren't they? They'll have to confront this at some point. They're talking about raising interest rates. A lot of people assume that by the end of the year, this is the economic situation we're looking at whether they forecast it or not. And they keep on hiking as the numbers clearly show this economy's in recession. Yeah, my point is that, you know, if there, I think there's already a debate actually at the ECB which is for now not having a direct impact on their immediate decisions, they all agree on the idea that no, our monetary stance with super accommodation is not that competitive. You bring it, let's say, to the upper end of the neutral range. And then this is where the differences appear. You have those working to say, I don't care. I just continue hiking as long as inflation is there. And others, and I would probably agree with those who would say, look, once we've brought, I would probably see rate at the or band of neutral range. Let's stop a while. Let's put them in. Let's see how things happen. But for the time being, there is an alignment actually of doves and hoax around this idea that in any case, our stance was far too accommodative to start with. So I don't expect actually this debate to really trigger, to really have an impact on decisions before the very end of this year. In the meantime, it's new. As J.P. will say, they will keep it. Are you fit in the pain of your adult parity person, the first few days of being here? I'm certainly not the most vulnerable person on Earth, but yeah, I've been in New York for two days now.

13265," I'm just saying that particular point that you've made is well taken. Sure. And it's an important one and the biggest difference between the Eurozone crisis back in 2010 and now.

Oh, I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things.

13266," You've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is... It's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. You know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have the water rises and the mountains shake all over we're made. We will never, no, no, we will never, no. We do expect the market to remain volatile. You know, these rallies that we're seeing we continue to expect them to fade. I mean, the fed remain determined to bring down inflation and they have been clear to us that they will not blink nor even wink. Not at all. Senior U.S. Equity Strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management speaking with us on Friday. A big day that really gave people a sense that the economy would be able to withstand whatever the fed had for it. And then we get some news later that day where you have President Biden come out and announce some potential restrictions on semiconductor and chip technology being exported from the U.S. to China. The big fear is where are we headed in an economic war based in the semiconductor space. Mandy Psiang covers the semiconductor space for a senior technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence joining us here. And he right now I'm looking at AMD shares in the U.S. pre-market trading down 1.7 percent across the board. This is being viewed for by the market as a negative. How much is this a negative for U.S. earnings and how much is this a broader negative that has not even realized? Well, so look, they pre-announced last week and the focus was on weakness in the client segment, which is the PCs where we think there was a pull forward. I think what remains to be seen is what will happen to the data centers, which has held well, which is the reason why AMD's gross margins have gone up. And look, we have already seen about 20 percent negative revisions on the top line. That will trickle down to the bottom line. So that has already transpired in terms of estimate cuts. Aside from just AMD, just on a broader level, the semiconductor space in the United States and beyond has suffered dramatically this year, at least with shares down about 40 percent. How much has yet to be realized with an escalating conflict between the U.S. and China? Well, so we've seen kind of a similar situation with the tariff force back in 2018-19. And what could potentially happen here is similar to what happened to Huawei. There will be one company that will be kind of at the forefront of this that could really suffer. We don't know who that could be. But I think where U.S. is going is they want to restrict...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1492,2022-10-10 12:52:28
13267," It will be one company that will be kind of at the forefront of this that could really suffer. We don't know who that could be. But I think where US is going is they want to restrict access to software that Chinese companies use to design super computers, their latest chips, as well as the semi-cap equipment. And so once that happens, it kind of limits China's ability to go to the latest process notes, which is what they want to get to in terms of, you know, the self-sufficiency around semiconductors. But how that translates into, you know, Nvidia or AMD's outlook, it remains to be seen. What kinds of retaliation could we expect to see from China in response? Well, so look at Nvidia, for example. They have about 25 to 30% revenue exposure to Chinese customers. Now a lot of those customers give that, you know, packet chips back to an entity or a US-based company. So clearly, you know, it will trickle down, but there are Chinese customers that will be impacted and that will have, you know, a cascading effect in terms of what that will do down the line. How significant of a deal is this? Because when I read this on Friday that this came out, I thought this was a pretty big escalation in something that we've been hearing all year. How do you view it? Well, so this one in particular was focused on the leading notes. And what I mean by that is China is trying to create their own supercomputers. They want to be in the lead when it comes to the latest, you know, AI and machine learning and all the kind of the latest servers that they can design. So that's where this particular ban was focused on. Now what could happen is because China feels like they don't have access to anything, they could impose a certain ban on a US-based company. And that's what I mean by, if things escalate, you will see a real kind of dire situation where the US companies are also impacted in terms of their ability to do things. You were talking earlier about the Ford guidance that we heard out of some of the semiconductor companies in the US and beyond and how negative some of those forecasts are. How significant is this for the broader PC, the broader smartphone industry that could really be foreshadowing what we could expect to see from Apple and Google and everyone as they report earnings? Yeah. So this earnings season, we expect more negative revisions following the earnings. We've already seen in anticipation, but you are going to see more of that. And look, with chips, there are certain pockets that are still seeing very strong demand. We are still in shortages when it comes to auto chips and more or less on the data center side when it comes to high performance computing. But others such as, you know, smartphones, PCs, that's where we are seeing a real desaleration inventory build up. And you're going to see inventory write downs, which is what we saw with AMD and Intel before. Has this been priced in? I think with AMD, it is. I mean, you see the stock is down over 50%. So it's in anticipation of that weakness in the client segment. Intel, we know they've been down and the stock continues to go down. So more or less it's priced in, but at the same time with chips, the pendulum always in swings extreme and this time will be no different in terms of, you know, the boom and boss fee typically see so chips are a very cyclical sector and that hasn't changed. We also are hearing a lot more with specific companies building out foundries in a number of places with the announcement of upstate New York, being the latest place where one's going to be built. How much more onshoreing is there going to be, especially as this becomes the epicenter of ongoing conflict internationally? A chip manufacturing is, you know, asset intensive. You need to kind of build the capex over time and that's where Intel is constantly trying to get money from the US government, other governments and the FAPs take time to come online. So it'll be three to five years before we start seeing manufacturing actually happen in those FAPs. But bottom line is if you get to a point where you have capacity and the utilization, that's key. It's over 70 to 80 percent, that's when it becomes a good business for Intel or global foundries or anybody who's based in the US. How much more inquiries do you get these days than in the past? And I ask this because a lot of people are saying this is the telltale sign. This is the area to watch. Check out how big Apple is, you know, as a component of the overall index, look at how significant this is, look at the move here. This indicates what's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1493,2022-10-10 12:57:36
13268," This is the area to watch. Check out how big Apple is, you know, as a component of the overall index. Look at how significant this is. Look at the move here. This indicates what's to come. How many calls like that do you get? Well, we get a lot of that in the sense. Everyone wants to know what's the worst case scenario right now. And that's how, you know, the markets work. Even though it's a low probability outcome, they want to know that. So what is it? Well, in the case of Apple, we know over 98% of their goods are made in China. And, you know, TSMC in China is a big factor. So even though they're trying to move stuff out of China into Vietnam and India, but it's still, you know, the worst case scenario is pretty extreme here in terms of this. So going forward, which company are you most focused on in terms of a possible surprise? Well, so Nvidia is the one that trades at the highest multiple in that group. You know, 11, 10, 11 time sales, the expectations are high. Everyone thinks they will continue to do well on the data center side. But with data center, you will see a cloud digestion phase. Remember, the data center spend is all from seven or eight hyperscale cloud guys. And they will pay her back. They've been spending, you know, above capacity for a while because the demand was so huge in terms of digital transformation and post-pandemic event. They will cut back. They will be a digestion phase and then things will resume. But when that digestion phase happens, I think Nvidia is probably at the forefront of data exposure. Mandy Pissing, thank you so much for being with us and good luck with all of those worst case scenarios that people are looking to find out. I can empathize with that. You know, just what's my base case? What's my bare case? Coming up on balance of power on Bloomberg TV and radio, Wendy Cutler, Vice President and Managing Director at the Asia Society.

That is the next thing that the market has to focus on. That's really going to be the next trigger in terms of the market coming under pressure. Joining us now to discuss this flow banks SD Twek. New Vines, Tony Rotary, Gers SD first to you. Chalced Evans of the Chicago Fed right now saying optimistic we can reduce inflation and devoid recession. Do you think that optimism is misplaced? Well, at this point, not yet. Although the more the Fed caten, the tougher it's going to be with soft landing. We are seeing tentative cracks in the labor market, not quite in the non-parameterals, but the Jolt finally came down a little bit. We're seeing some softening in growth, but at the same time consumption seems to be holding up pretty well. And as we said, unemployment is holding up. So far, a decent mix for the Fed, but if inflation doesn't come down over the next couple of months, they're going to continue to tighten pretty aggressively. That could definitely have pretty bad effects for 2023. And perhaps 4.5% is as far as they'll go. Tony, let's watch Charles Evans is saying right now back in rates around 4.5% in 23 and on hold for some time. What's the some time? How long? Good morning, Jonathan. Good to be with you. And while I appreciate Charles's optimism that maybe a little bit too much of rainbows and unicorns. So I think 4.5% is a possibility. We would say 4.75% is more likely. But we do think that they're likely to hold throughout 2023. So while we think the economy is going to be in recession, we think it'll be a relatively mild recession. And we think that the Fed will actually pivot to rate cuts sometime in early 2024 2023 up to 4.75 and hold through much next year. SD plug that into what this would mean for the equity market. If we went to 4.75 through much of next year, how much pain would we see? Well, the Fed, the futures market is already pricing somewhere between 4.5 and 4.6. So 4.75 is a bit above where we are. I think as long as we don't hit that 5% mark or more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1495,2022-10-10 13:05:44
13270," is already pricing somewhere between four and a half and four point six. So 4.75 is a bit above where we are. I think as long as we don't hit that 5% mark or more, the market is pretty much pricing most of it in and should be able to withstand it. We've seen earnings expectations come down not just for this earning season, but also for 2023. Right now we still have those rate cuts priced in for the end of 2023, but it's still a little early to say that the Fed would not look through that. That's over 12 months to get inflation back to 2% and then potentially see what the growth impact is and if the economy needs some help come out, either of a shallow recession or of a very sharp flowdown, in any case, that's what they're going to engineer. So right now the market's probably pricing in something close to that. Anything much more hawkish for longer, I think would be quite painful. As the last time we spoke, you thought that June lows would hold. They didn't. What went wrong, do you think? Well, I think a couple of hot inflation prints really was the worst of it. And the market, I guess, was expecting a pivot. I don't know who thought we would pivot to do this. I mean, pivoting to a pause or to see what the rate hikes are doing. Let's keep in mind this is the fastest pace of rate hikes the Fed has ever done. At some point they need to see what the impact is. You don't see that after one month. So we're going to have four some percent of hikes within six to nine months. And the Fed is going to have to have a look at that too. Features up a third of 1% on the S&P and then as that up to 10s of 1% CPI. It's just going to hijack the conversation later this week with regards to the Fed reserve. And it's on to corporate America, JP Morgan on Friday morning. These corporations, corporate America right now has to face a growing list of headwinds. Relentless monetary tightening, a surging dollar and an incoming read on inflation or weighing on sentiment. Kelly Lyne says more. Hey, Kelly. Hey, John, yeah, it's not a great cocktail for corporate profitability. We're going to get our first reads on that really coming this week. Along with JP Morgan, you have 14 other S&P companies reporting this week. The bulk of them though will come in the weeks to follow between the week of October 24th and October 31st. You have about two thirds of the market cap and members of the S&P 500 reporting. So buckle up. It's going to be a bit of a long ride. But to your point, John, given all of the headwinds that these companies are facing, we have seen a deterioration in expectations for this earnings season. The closer we get to it back in mid August, about two months ago. Analyst expected EPS growth of about 4.3 percent for the S&P. That number is down now to 2.6 percent. So definitely a slowdown compared to what we saw in the first and second quarters. But analysts are still betting that these third quarter results will represent the trough with a rebound starting in the fourth quarter. We'll see how long though that optimism can hold up. Considering we have seen things start to deteriorate in sell side expectations, analyst earning downgrades outpacing upgrades for 17 weeks in a row through the data we have at the end of September. We've heard from a number of strategists consistently on the street who are warning we have not seen the worst of the downgrades yet that more are on their way. I would just point out in our latest Mlive survey released this morning that poll survey showed more than 60 percent of more than 700 respondents say this earnings season will push the S&P lower. John. Kelly Lies, thank you. Tons of warnings this morning, including another one from Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson who said the following. Last week, packed in a year's worth of volatility, both up and down as the market battle between deteriorating fundamentals and supportive technicals continues. Ultimately, fundamentals prevail in our view, but it could take longer than we would like. I'd love you if you were on the earnings season going into the big banks this Friday. Well, everyone is expecting it to be poor earnings expectations have come down. Everyone thinks this Q3 is going to be the opportunity for guidance to be poor for 2023 expectations to be brought down. The question really is how much is already priced in at this point of this bad news that pretty much everyone knows is coming. I think we're going to get, of course, some pretty bad surprises. Let's say something around with the FedEx said, although it's difficult to imagine much worse than the guidance that they gave. I think we're also going to have a couple of these, as we usually have, tech should hold up better. The banks, I mean, so far we've seen that consumers are holding up. There's a little bit more of an impact at the lowest wage earners because of inflation, and beyond that, we're still seeing some solidity in the underlying.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1496,2022-10-10 13:10:50
13271," are holding up. There's a little bit more of an impact at the lowest wage earners because of inflation. But beyond that, we're still seeing some solidity in the underlying consumption trend. Tony, it's not a secret. Is it? Things are bad. That's what SD's getting at here. If the World Bank president and the IMF managed to direct the resaying here, you know we're already there and we were there a long time ago. The IMF managed to direct it early this morning. Kristen Innigoggev is saying the risk of recession has gone up. Mr. Malpass, President Malpass at a World Bank saying a real danger of a global recession. I think at this point, Tony, this is all one understood. How well priced is it? Well, John, do you have a good point? From our perspective, what's interesting is that we do think that the rates markets have priced in the vast majority of the moves. So when we look at the 10 year or the two year where Fed funds futures and price, we think that we've really captured the majority of the move and are much more comfortable now from standpoint of duration risk, where we still see some more downside and don't think that the markets have fully priced in that downside. We look at risk markets. We think that while earnings projections as Kaylee pointed out have come down, we do think they still have further to go. We still think it's a little bit too optimistic when you look at Q4 and when you look at the first half of 2023 from an earnings perspective. So we think the risk premiums need to price in some more downside risk. So that is probably lower equities. It's also wider spreads when we look at high yield emerging markets, investment great fixed income. As you move through the balance of this year and the first quarter of 2023, we think you'll have some better entry points. We don't think they're going to be a repeat of the global financial crisis type of downside levels. But we do think you have a little bit more downside still ahead of us. It's only I think a lot of people would take some comfort, just a little bit of comfort. If the positive correlation between equities and bonds actually broke down, when can I start looking at a long bond that starts to behave like a long bond in a recession? We think that as you turn the calendar, that you really will be back to that more maybe traditional typical bond market response and offset to your equity portfolio. We certainly think of it as a balance of this year, whether it's a strong CPI print possibly or some employment data that's maybe stronger, there's still a potential for a little bit of an increase further from here in rates. But we don't see the tenure much above 4 percent at all. We think that we'll end closer to 3.5. And more importantly, we think that as that economic weakness in 23 becomes very apparent to investors, we're looking at a year in 23 10 year that will be down much closer to 3 percent than it is even to 3.5.4. So that's when duration risk in the bond market will begin to play the portfolio, the balanced role in your portfolio. It's only you starting to lean into a little bit of duration, or is it too early? Well, Jonathan, as you know, we've been pretty short from a duration perspective for the entire year. We're now pretty close to neutral. So we're not ready yet to say, hey, we've seen the peak in yields and we want to get long here, but we certainly have leaned in to it enough to cover our shorts and get pretty close to neutral. Because as I said, we think that 90 plus percent of the rate move is priced in. Tony Rodriguez, sticking with us alongside SD2, B of A just published moments ago. Thanks for America on their equity strategy team, saying the following, consensus feedback from clients. Third quarter might hold up, but who cares? Guardians is going to be absolutely terrible. They go on to say we expect a slight 1 percent miss in 3Q, but big downside risk standing in 4Q. We forecast $200 in 23 EPS versus the street at 240. We'll build on that in just a moment. Coming up, the B of E, launching new safety net measures to calm the bond market. The Bank of England is in a very tight spot.

Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin, not just UCLA quarterback, but name and consumers like this superstar. I'm even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but links. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology, to Bloomberg, the lineup. It's almost a kind of they'll do whatever it takes on period of time. It did the right thing, we think, by protecting the pension funds at very short notice. Eventually it's going to have to stop buying those bonds and start going for QT. There is value in the UK market, it's just a question of if that value will be destroyed by political risk. The UK ramping up efforts to ease market turmoil, the Bank of England expanding its emergency support for the bond market, just as the government announced its plans to deliver its fiscal strategy almost a month ahead of schedule. Team coverage starts right now with Danny Berger and London and Kelly Lines here in New York. Danny, run us through the latest. We had the BOE essentially expanding these operations, so they're going to double the amount of daily auction that they can buy. It was 5 billion pounds, it's not going to be up to 10 billion pounds. Of course only 5 billion of the 40 billion on offer so far has been used, so not a lot of usage and that will still end on Friday. But it's not going to stop there. They are launching this temporary repo facility. The idea here being that those who need liquidity, especially those pensions under pressure, can tap this, they can also use collateral that goes beyond bonds, for example, they can put up corporate debt as well. Now it's a one, two punch of the BOE and the UK Treasury trying to get ahead to calm markets. We also learned today that quasi-corting is going to be publishing that fiscal agenda on the 31st of October. That's moving it up from November 27th. So now it's going to be ahead of the BOE decision, but still John, it's going to come the same day that QT is set to start. The guilt market is still all over the place. Kelly Lines, you're 10 year at 14 basis points. Yeah, the reaction to the news of the BOE expanding this program is just yields higher. And to be our off of session highs at one point, the 30 year guilt yield was up 22 basis points on the day. We're now up just about 15 basis points, but still at 453, we remain around the highest level we've seen going all the way back to 2011. One strategy is over at TD telling Bloomberg that essentially the market is doubting if the BOE is going to fill the maximum number of orders. And also the fact that they're announcing these new measures today kind of signals that they aren't going to have any kind of extension on this emergency bond, temporary bond buying program. And so over the last month, the moves have been even more dramatic. We're up 106 basis points on the 30 year on the month of 104.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1498,2022-10-10 13:18:52
13273," on this emergency bond, temporary bond buying program. Now, of course, over the last month, the moves have been even more dramatic. We're up 106 basis points on the 30-year on the month, up 146 on the two-year at the same time that we've seen more weakness in the British pound off of the tweaked levels from a few weeks ago, but still around 110. And as Danny alluded to, it's not just about October 31st. It's about what happens just a few days later on November 3rd when we get the rate decision from the BOE. And the market is expecting it to be less aggressive than thought just a few weeks ago. Right now, Andrew Bailey and Co are sitting at 2.25. They are now expected to hike to around the 3.38 levels. So essentially, the market is pricing in a 68% probability of 125 basis point hike. Massive move, no doubt about it, but that is still less of year than markets thought a few weeks ago when we were discussing the likelihood potentially of an inter-meeting hike, John. Danny, let's talk about the Canada now as it stands. So Kelly just went through fiscal announcement into the month. In November 3rd, the Bank of England, you said it. QT, the end of the month on the same day that they deliver that budget. Danny, is that actually going to happen? Does anyone use speed to believe it will? No, to put it simply, John, we were just playing sound there from Althof Casama of State Street who I spoke to earlier and said, no, there's no way the BOE is going to be able to go ahead with QT. If they are now being pushed around by the bond vigilantes, we're going to sing it today. Kayleigh pointed it out. This is a market that is testing the BOE. What will that test look like? If they're going to have QT and a budget announced on the 31st, look, it could happen that the budget comes out. It's clear that the deficit will come down, but considering the volatility as of late, this is a very fragile market. So you have the bond buying ending on Friday. You have QT and the new budget on the 31st, a rate decision then on November 3rd followed shortly by other central bank decisions. And then this repo, that will stop, at least for the time being on November 10th, John, a lot of potential risk events. Danny, thank you. Looking forward to your coverage through the week as well. Kayleigh, thanks. Thank you very much as well. Jeffries had this to say, long and guilt are coming dangerously close to levels where we could again see margin calls. They went on to say and force selling from liability driven investment accounts. The BOE will need to step up the purchases this week to prevent further margin calls. Tony, are you interested in the guilt market just yet? Or is this one still too volatile to touch? You know, Jonathan, our head is spinning, given the number of policy you turns that you're seeing in the UK, both in fiscal and monetary policy. So we think that clearly it is too difficult right now the volatility is too high to take any kind of really definitive position in that market. You mentioned a year's worth of volatility in one week in the equity market. In the UK, they've had a generation worth of volatility in the rates market in the last couple of weeks. So we think all this does is delay the BOE's need to address incredibly high inflation. So the problems in the UK are not being resolved by any of these policies obviously. And the BOE's main problem is just becoming more and more difficult as we move through the year, given that they can't address it directly because of the volatility they're seeing in the rates markets. It's taken some attention away from what's been happening elsewhere. I think we've all been looking at spreads in Italy over Germany through this morning, through the wider the year, a little bit early this morning, back to about 251 basis points called it 252. As the right now, the Italian 10 year, just through 470, is that becoming a bigger and bigger problem that the ECB might have to address in soon? Well, I think that's what the bond market would like, right? Since they announced they're a new tool, everyone's been wondering how and if Italy would become eligible. Let's not forget the financial stability is an outright objective and part of the ECB's mandate. So if it becomes too unruly, if it becomes too problematic for Italy or for the rest of the European Union as a whole, you'd have to imagine they're going to act. As long as it remains orderly for now, they might allow it for some time, but the ECB is certainly going to have to give a lot more details on all these different policy tools and how they're going to address the spread-winding to maintain this financial stability in addition because they're going to have to keep tightening to bring that inflation level now. Tony, we spent a long time now talking about policy and conflict between monetary policy authorities and what's happening on the inflation side and what's happening on the financial stability side. Can they achieve financial stability?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1499,2022-10-10 13:23:54
13274," policy and conflict between monetary policy authorities and what's happening on the inflation side and what's happening on a financial stability side. Can they achieve financial stability and get inflation down at the same time because at the moment everything's very, very confusing Tony, rates up, maintaining some form of bond buying simultaneously with that in mind, Tony, when is the Italian tenure become a buy? Jonathan, our view has been that at this 250 level, it really begins to get the attention of the ECB as we get closer to 300. We think the job owning will begin in earnest. Once you get above 300 and at 3 to 350, that's what they're going to need to start actually talking about specific plans, potentially to address that. If we get over 350, then they, I actually think they will begin to inject themselves in the market. So it's too early right now. We think given all of the volatility uncertainty to make a stand on that Italian German spread, but we think once you get to 300, that 300 area, it becomes a lot more interesting and needs to be evaluated carefully. Well, let's set the scene for the end of this month, October 27th, as is when the ECB next meets. Can they go 75 basis points month end? You know, they can they they haven't placed in close to 10%. We'll see what the German number comes out as relatively in I think in the next couple of days. Yeah, let's not forget that part of the mess in the bond market, including what's happening in Italy is also kind of contagion from the UK. So we are not seeing a lot of stability, but this is not all about Italy. We haven't seen that many headlines since Mrs. Nelloni became prime minister. So the ECB certainly needs to act to contain inflation. They know that the gross prospects are poor. Obviously the escalation in the war in the Ukraine isn't helpful for inflation or for growth, but they could go 75 because they definitely need to address it. S.D. to work. Tony Rodriguez to the two of you. Thank you. Some big central bank decisions coming up in the next 30 days or so. The next four weeks, the bank having to be in one, the ECB another, the Federal Reserve, make it three right now, the spread of Italy over Germany, 252, 252 or 253 basis points or so.

We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we used sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest in the industry were doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1500,2022-10-10 13:27:33

Well, let's start out with some movers to the downside going in the opposite direction of this possible update, the first update in four. The one down at the high end of the previous year. Very recently, the last update, the last update in Australia, we have a number of more than 1.5 million wheat profit margins also along with a tough macro background. Rivian also down sharply, down about 5.4%. They've recalled 13,000 vehicles to check a minor structural flaw. This just after they sorted out some of their production issues.

This, of course, could cause long-term ripples. Now, chips, as you know, John, are already in a world of hurt. The overall index down about 40 percent on the year. Big companies pre-announcing AMD last week down more than 10 percent on the day in video over the summer. These new restrictions will not help. These tensions could really build and on the day. We're not seeing the kind of declines that we've seen more recently. Those double-digit declines. Nonetheless, AMD down about 1 percent on semiconductor down. NXP semi-conductors, both of those apples suppliers and then applied materials down 2.2 percent. That, of course, is a semi-cap equipment company. A leading tell on chips overall and many saying that the chips as you know, John, are the new transports, the tell on the economy. We'll pick up on that story again in about 10 minutes time. We'll get the DC and gold to all of that, too, with Amory Hauder and Dan and Washington. Abby, thank you. About two minutes into this, we're up higher by a third of 1 percent on the S&P.

That means one busy, Shinani Basker, Kaysian Ali. John, we have the moment of truth for these big banks. As we see just how much money they've made and currency fixed in coming rates markets, JP Morgan is expected.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1501,2022-10-10 13:35:18
13276," We have the moment of truth for these big banks. As we see just how much money they've made in currency fixed income in rates markets, JPMorgan is expected still to bring in more money than a year ago at the trading business help by fixed income, but less money than a quarter ago. That is more than $4 billion expected in that fixed income unit. I want to also take a look at lending here because JPMorgan will really start off this conversation about bellweathers. So look at that rise in rates you're seeing, that 10-year treasury reggills, but then look at that decline you're seeing at the evaluation of the S&P 500 banks index. That is because people don't like that inverted yield curve. They're really worried about credit quality moving forward, and about $1.2 billion worth of provisions for loan losses right now are expected for JPMorgan to report this quarter. We'll want to get Jamie Dimons forecast again on that economic hurricane up front. Look at those earnings estimates there just falling falling interestingly here. You have Morgan Stanley expected to fall 26%. They are reporting Friday. They are the richest of the big five banks trading at 1.4 times the price to book. A little more than that, Goldman Sachs has been fluctuating all year just under book value. So the question is, are these prices to perfection when you're seeing the ones that are already trading on the lower side? Or is there more to come? Remember Morgan Stanley serves wealthier clients in its wealth management unit. Does that see pressure as times get harder ahead? And then of course there's your favorite story on Wall Street. Do they take more markdowns when it comes to those leverage loan portfolios given they have been so heavily exposed to some of the biggest deals on Wall Street? Twitter, the elephant in the room there. Exactly. Thank you. Looking forward to your coverage. They're own research departments forecasting some glue. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, both publishing new research highlighting headwind stemming from slowing demand, soaring costs and a strengthening US dollar. Kelly, nice has more. Hey, Kaylee. Hey, yeah, John, both of these guys have sounded this warning before and they're doing so once again as we get closer to this earning season. I want to start with what David Costan over at Goldman Sachs is saying because he's talking about a number of different headwinds. He's talking about the cost and on the margin side also when it comes to tax changes and then the stronger US dollar, which has just gone from strength to strength that's up about 14% even more so on a year to date basis. And since we ended the second quarter results, it's up another about 6% or so stronger against literally everything in G 10. And that is very problematic for big multinational companies with high overseas exposure because it makes products more expensive for international buyers, which can hit demand. And then any sales you are able to make become worth less when they're converted back into dollars. So Costan points out that that stronger program back historically has been linked to fewer sales beats and that will support the performance of stocks with more domestic sales relative to those with a higher proportion of foreign sales. And we can see the discrepancy and the performance of some of those equities so far on a year to date basis. Then moving on to Mike Wilson's argument, which again, we've heard a few times now. He's essentially paying attention to the cost side pointing out inventory, labor costs, other latent expenses that are wreaking havoc. He says on cash flow and he says the bear market won't be over until the deteriorating fundamental picture is more fully discounted. He thinks that looks like a less than 500 trading at a multiple of more like 13 times forward earnings to accurately reflect that right now though, John, we're trading at 15.9 times. Kelly, more pain to come. The message from Morgan Stanley, Kelly, Lides, thank you. The message from Pimco and their new outlook looks a little something like this. Andrew Boer was forecasting a shadow recession. As his base case, the team writing, we see a downside risk for global equity markets, given starting valuations and earnings expectations that may not account for ongoing central bank tightening and increased recession risk. Andrew Boer is a police to say to us right now. Andrew, what a full of catch up with you, sir. Let's start there. Recession. It's all we talk about at the moment. Are you telling me it's still not well priced? I think shallow recession is a price to. So if you look at fixed income markets, you look at credit markets. The shallow recession is a price in the US in Europe. So one question there is just how big the slowdown will be. But as allocation experts, our equity analysts think that the equity markets aren't pricing in enough. So a bit of a gap between credit markets and equity markets, obviously, often the same companies involved. And so a positive view on credit versus equities given that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1502,2022-10-10 13:39:06
13277," Equity markets, obviously often the same companies involved. And so a positive view on credit versus equities given that disparity. And do you see the opportunity in fixed income or broadly then right now? Yeah, no, I think it looks, it looks, it looks quite good in terms of the fixed income outlook when you look out over the next few years, it's just given the, the starting levels of yield. So we've seen repricing across global markets, you have central bank rates, and expectations higher, 10 year rates higher. Broadly, it looks kind of broadly fair to us. We think that you've seen a lot of the repricing and that means that when you look at coal bond funds, we look at a US coal bond fund or a global fund, you know, 5, 5 and a half percent type yields more when you are looking at credit. So as a medium term view that looks, you know, really attractive in the short term, there's the uncertainty your reporters have been talking about, there's uncertainty about the economy, the fed central banks more broadly. So tentically, it's, I think, it's a difficult time. But looking out over the next few years, the, the outlooks for global bonds, US bonds looks, you know, quite attractive here and a lot better than it was looking one or two years ago. Andrew, can we strip our credit and look at sovereigns and almost treasuries just exclusively, just for a moment? Last time we had a big inflation shock several decades ago, it was followed by a big disinflation rebust on the multi decade bond bull market. Is it too early to consider the destination, whether we're returning back to that kind of theme out of this one? Well, so the starting levels are different compared with, you know, the very long term, returns to bond markets. But the levels you've seen are look at forward rates now. So you abstract from the fed tightening cycle. It looks pretty reasonable to us and you can, there's various gauges that you, you use, you might compare nominal growth with your, your nominal yield, but it looks, it looks reasonable. So I can see two way risks to the US 10 year here. And then we have this recession risk. So worst recession risks equity market under performance. There's the potential for the capital gains in bonds, which you wouldn't have seen one or two years ago. So the baseline looks pretty good in terms of yield levels. Broadly, you know, we're pretty neutral on the US duration here. In the next few weeks, this could go high. This could go lower. But I think the medium term returns the value is there. And also after a difficult year for returns across ethnic classes. And so equities of under-perform bonds have under-performed. The potential for risk establishment of more normal patterns. With bond market, net-e-market, it's not moving in the same direction as they have been doing during this a typical period. Andrew, speaking to PIMCO over many years, typically when you anticipate a tough time, you raise cash and you get ready to be so-called liquidity providers. And I see that in the language if you're outlook once again. Can you describe the moments that you actually do want to be liquidity providers and the moments you don't want anything to do with it? And can we use the guilt market of the last couple of weeks as an example? Did you step into the guilt market to provide that liquidity, Andrew? So not in large size. So guilt markets, we've been underway UK interest rate risk. And we've not, not huge positions. We've bought a little bit during this period. And I just think the level of guilt now looks quite reasonable. First, it's treasuries after a long kind of aboriginal period. You might think where guilt yields were lower. Big unpleasant adjustment, but we now see pretty reasonable levels for guilt. And more broadly, I think when you look at high quality duration, high quality corporate credit, you can think about currencies over time. There's a lot of good potential trades to do as you get some clarity on the fed cycle, the global central bank cycle. The moment, as you said, we think it's right to be pretty careful there. Look at the volatility in equity markets last week. There's a lot of uncertainty about this point in the cycle. But over time, if you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1503,2022-10-10 13:43:14
13278," in equity markets last week. There's a lot of uncertainty about this point in the cycle. But over time, if you go into this sort of slowdown, this sort of recession well-prepared, well-prepared, then you've got the opportunity to add high-quality assets, cheaper prices, take advantage of dislocations, be liquidity providers, as you said. Is the Italian tenure part of that story, Andrew? So we've been underweight Italy. You have seen significant moves in European fixed income. This year, the level of the moves in Buns, for example, given what's happened with Treasuries, you know, a bigger move in terms of Buns or the Baytura Buns to Treasuries than you would normally anticipate. And in that environment, the higher beta assets are going to underperform. So Italy has done that. We've tended to be underweight Italy during a period where the ECB is tightening on the basis of this high-beta nature of the Italian market. I think it's becoming more interesting. You have a lot of political risk and uncertainty there. But I think, you know, over the weeks, we'll get more comfort in terms of the political framework. So tactically, underweight, but I think with a medium-term view, you know, you could be positive there. And it's going to be interesting the extent to which the Europeans are cooperative in terms of the energy price shock. And is there the potential for common bonds, issuance in Europe, as we saw during the COVID period? I think if we start to get the sense that that could happen, that's a real positive, I think, in terms of Europe and the medium-term outlook. Well, let's dig deeper in Europe, then. Does your view on the sovereign? To what extent does that shape your view on the underlying credit of those countries? So let's say Italy and let's say corporate credit, bank credit. And did you view on the sovereign's shape? Did you view on bank credit in the same way it did maybe eight, nine, ten years ago? Yeah, so I think you... So banks, you always look at the relationship with the sovereign more generally with industrials. You know, there's more of a debate, but I think that the level of view of the sovereign is very important. In general, we think that it's better to be in US credit. So we tend to be underweight European corporate credit, overweight versus that in the US, in terms of industrials. And I think that makes sense. The Russia shock energy, this is much more of a European event, much more uncertainty in Europe. I think European financials, if you're at the higher, you know, the higher quality part of the market, I think they look fine. I think they look, you know, relatively attractive. But at the time when you can find, you know, good value across the board, there's no reason to go down in quality. You can stick with the higher quality names and sectors. And I wanted to finish on a question that I explored with Rick Reader of BlackRock on Friday. I'd love for your view on it too. Andrew, we've just had a decade of QE, trillions of dollars of it, we've had negative rates at central banks like the ECB, the S&B, and elsewhere. And we've seen those negative rates captured in sovereign debt markets and corporate debt markets as well. We've blown that up in 12 months. And Andrew, all I hear from fixed income strategists, people who run portfolios and fixed income, is that there's resilience and credit. The things will be okay. That we've done a lot of work with balance sheets. We've pushed out maturity walls into the future. Andrew, do you think we've fully realised the negative consequences associated with blowing up a decade worth of zero interest rates? Well, I think there's two points I'd like to make there. So the first point is I think that you do have significant improvement across credit markets, balance sheets, greater resilience. And so I think that is right. And we think that in the environment of, you know, shallow recession, that credit markets are broadly priced for that sort of outcome. But there's a risk of deeper than expected recession, particularly I think in Europe, given the proximity to Russia and the energy issue. So in the medium term.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1504,2022-10-10 13:47:38
13279," of deeper than expected recession, particularly I think in Europe, given the proximity to Russia and the energy issue. So in the medium term, I think there's value in the short term, tactically be careful there. So I think that's the point you want to make. Medium term, the positive picture, but there is the risk of great and expected recession and related to this. And again, you saw this push and pull less week with equity markets. Inflation remains a significant problem across markets. The extent to which central banks are going to be forced higher than is currently priced in is something that you need to be very clear about. So with credit markets, we would make a distinction between long term investments going into by cheaper assets where you're high in the capital structure where you are very, very default remote. But being careful, there's no reason for us to go down in quality with, with customer credits at this time, at this stage of the cycle. Andrew, wonderful to catch up. Enjoyed reading the outlook, Andrew Balls there of PIMCO. Come up on this program, the US imposing fresh technology curves on China. Companies are investing in America and we're all making sure government delivers. The infrastructure law, the chips and science act. Let's go right there. The conversation up next. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. I've been in and seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. What do the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, you know, we have a unique way that we go get big, new investments. I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there, and if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what the stocks might do. In any time I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, in the ultimate output for a company, a share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level, and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again.

Kelly, lines in New York, hairmage down in DC, and Marie, the latest. What we're hearing from the Biden administration, Jonathan, is not just this makes sense for the administration in their domestic push after the chips act this summer, but really what they're trying to do is thwart China's capability, one in the semiconductor industry, but also in their military capabilities. Let me give you a little bit more of a statement from the Commerce Secretary, an Assistant Commerce Secretary for Export Controls on Friday. China has poured resources into developing super computing capabilities. It goes on. It is using these capabilities to monitor, track, and surveil their own citizens and fuel its military modernization. Now, depending how much this is impacted in terms of the controls on what sectors, which companies and how far they go, it can reach Jonathan a broad scope, whether it's EVs, the military, aerospace, and smartphones. But the big question is, what's the scope going to look like? Okay, me pretty clear. How this is playing out in the market. Yeah, in that ship stocks are down really across the world. It started in Asia overnight, and you're seeing those names under pressure a few minutes into trading here in the US as well.

And that could of course drag on their ultimate earnings, which already weren't in a great place. We've had a series of warnings from semiconductor companies over the last few weeks about plummeting demand. And then, of course, in Asia, you add on these new cocktail factors for the chip space to regulatory pressures from Beijing and an economy hit by COVID-0, which is all why we have seen the Hang Sank tech index down about 60% since March of last year drastically under performing tech peers in regions like the US and Europe.

So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one.

The Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history. Mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year, and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners. And to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. And it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by American culture. It's everywhere you look in the Philippines. They're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America, and that extends to their love for soft drinks. Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s, it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion. It had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems. They thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. Look for the winning number in Thai Thai for a 7-day Alfonso TV, really new paper. You could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $68,000 doesn't sound like a lot now. But in 1992, that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time, the average monthly income was about $100. So a million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away. All of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi's sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the street.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1508,2022-10-10 14:04:41
13283," being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There was even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and the garbled facts had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile. Causing riots, there were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding winning bottle caps. Three, four, nine, three, four, nine. Some people had ten lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky three, four, nine bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a Molotov cocktail was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Raoul. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. A family had been ripped apart by this competition. Raoul told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. He was angry. He said to them, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said Pepsi goons bombed their own trucks. When I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants. In order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour, I just thought that was shocking. Of course Pepsi denied it, but how bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1509,2022-10-10 14:09:01
13284, I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it but help bizarre that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Del Fiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Del Fiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid him 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines not in America. Back in the Philippines Del Fiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Del Fiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for a five. Another heating for the branch one thirteen eight also three times a month. Also there was a time my father's was hospital. He had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to the next one. My father passed away on what it was in 2013 then after staying for almost one year in the hospital he died of complications with the high pay. After the death of my father I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to their their documents about this but you know they were very they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in the,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1510,2022-10-10 14:13:18
13285," make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions. We know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those good-will payments, but the financial effect could be much greater. After the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped, they were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience, by that experience of winning a million pesos, losing it, and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila. When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. Public figures commented on it. We should not let them affect our life wherever it was. The media echo went far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and everything, or big paper, around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city in Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. The person who had mastered my attack was actually sitting in the hotel eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article The Get Rich Quick Scheme that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhein-Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war so the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days the entire city is in black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000 the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically with such high prices. They thought that by going public they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares it has sometimes gone up but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11th 2017 the team was staying enough.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1511,2022-10-10 14:17:42
13286," on down since they made that decision. So on April 11th, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be sort of isolated from distractions. Things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic there to chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in the pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. On that day, we're heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan, I was supposed to watch the match with. He called me and said, turn on the TV, there was an attack of the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel they had just left. Authorities were attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were, however, reasons to doubt this particular narrative. It would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man, suspected of links to Islamist terrorism. One of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email onto investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. I would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off. Something is right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time. And it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1512,2022-10-10 14:22:16
13287," There was another big red flag about the Spurchas, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing, but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. In April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tubing in. It was on his way to work, and his name was Sergei Bina-Gord. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist. He didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris, and he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down, and he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borzier Dortmund shares. With all these derivatives, he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, the successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, intergolds would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sergei Wénigolud, didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Wénigolud had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described, doubting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Wénigolud as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Wénigolud is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. He begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Wénigolud apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for this attack in earnest. Wénigolud was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. Maybe he claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1513,2022-10-10 14:26:32
13288," with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them on. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Vayner Gold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence he was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany. The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero, though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About 100 tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small, it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. On according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain. We haven't found them all. There are thousands out there, and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, the way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence is that safe. Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most. But how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events, these collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to 10 kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad, and it will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around 100-ish meters. And it depends on the details of the composition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-Earth objects. In 1994, stargazers watched as comets Shoemaker-Levy Nine hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the Earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1514,2022-10-10 14:30:42
13289," sent of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters are McGueden and deep impact, brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large one kilometer nearer objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage. But they're just harder to spot because they're a fainter through smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the Earth. And we call these nearer objects. We think that there are millions and millions of nearer objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful, but time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and saying, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbit similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. That doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids, which weren't considered potentially hazardous, that when we went into the greater than four in time, they came quite close to Earth. You find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before. And we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small. And what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then C-Mon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations, which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits. Now, why doesn't NASA aim for Earth? Let's just talk a little bit about this thing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1515,2022-10-10 14:35:27
13290," And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forward in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth, but getting close to Earth. And then they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forward in time, for let's say a thousand years, and then you launch asteroids from the surface, as if they, if you go forward in time, would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today, and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid, which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors in quantum theory is all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI, can those things fill in the gaps, where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't? Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex, and if the physics gets more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore, and then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network, the F away of calculating in a fraction of a second, whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not, and therefore deserves more attention, or more time to spend on, for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it, and how much time we have before the encounter. We'd really like to find them on their decades away, because the more time you have, the more options you have, and the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid, until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last resort in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available if you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility, and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about, just nudging it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft one. It's kind of like bowling, if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane, just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big, big, massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer, though, and you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and it obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and letting a pressure of light sort of perturb its orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations, NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021, the agency will launch Dart, the double asteroid redirection test mission, which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime, discovering asteroids is our best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow-up. Because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data, we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last, let's say, 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years, most of them we haven't seen coming. So the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and not from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster, like a lot of natural disasters and climate change is a problem with the global commons. So the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes our ship over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1516,2022-10-10 14:39:38
13291," The thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's model. And nobody takes ownership over it. Asteroids are all over the sky. They just truly cross boundaries and borders with a second's notice. They're kind of imagining the future. Maybe he walks a small satellite around the earth that are always going and looking out for it. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence has stake, right?.... The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some passed the time by baking. Home made sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. It's your game. Or maybe you started a garden oasis in your backyard. Next, I'm going to put my letsis in. But for millions of others... I'm going to be posting stocks that will f***ing boom. They wanted to uproot the financial industry. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities or social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailer GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This isn't a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption, finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenif, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platformer like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenif and by Jubat, in where else Silicon Valley. As an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market. And that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1517,2022-10-10 14:43:48
13292," the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago, but they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robin Hood, think that by offering zero commission, that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robin Hood was courting, had been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robin Hood, even today with all of its popularity. The median account size is about $240. There's fiddellities in the Schwabs, in the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kinds of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account to just the headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robin Hood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform, is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robin Hood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized, the shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robin Hood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robin Hood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robin Hood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company and as it releases more products, come along with them. Robin Hood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robin Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robin Hood. They're in the shower, they check Robin Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18 while they're at school, checking their phones and between classes because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market in ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor at King Dempsey.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1518,2022-10-10 14:48:03
13293," At the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes. I'm losing money. I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18. And by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have interacted with the markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's dumb. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure, you can trade on it, but without research, information, and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now called narratives or means. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't. And the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's fast forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now. And that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwitz and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders of magnitude larger. As social media has played a bigger partner in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential to understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluensers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's gay-capped behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more, let's say, professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I have been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society. I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for a stock, you can just go up, it's a call. So think about like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at a price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day and I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your **** life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1519,2022-10-10 14:52:33
13294," I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word, because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some of the tension in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to seek around. And where people are sticking around, Reddit, and it's nearly countless subreddits of a finance. And by far, the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Starting in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stockings and we would be grasping for why stock XYZ jumped 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock. And it sort of squared the circle, so to speak, and started making sense. And it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. Then on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks. Now, clearly, this money is going to people who need to use that to eat, to live. But there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn, screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street Bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warring Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really, I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all. And it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze.

13295," The short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back. And the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze. And the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone, just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, game stop shares, absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers, everybody! Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Whoa! Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell game stop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too, until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including game stop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game. These big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory walls of institution aren't as powerful. It's maybe the institution's left them to be. I don't know if pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Tenev and Rorynkitty were called in to testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a look at Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does Israeli have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving, you know, they're agnostic, they're not hedge funds, they can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and, you know, ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFPs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that Patan go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media.

13296," And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs, the newspapers, or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say, Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result rural areas have exploded and they're poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the berms. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin but it is in the woods and inexplicably his internet is workable. My internet is okay. I pay a lot for it. It's around $140 a month. The download speed is great and the upload speed is terrible which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road my buddy has awful internet. Usually under two down and under point two up. So it's it's often unusable. Some days it's around one and other times it'll drop down to about point two point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's it's really frustrating. We're literally miles a few miles away from downtown and it just cuts off. This is a problem and the solutions are not there yet because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds then you don't have high speed harmony. You have Americans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. But in rural areas it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. So the pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about 25 megabits per second. However gigabit service which is a thousand megabits per second and symmetrical is running at about a hundred nineteen a month through a hundred thirty a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns spiral fiber. An internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1522,2022-10-10 15:05:23
13297," An internet service provider here in Nevada County, California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, civic boosters have been going to extreme chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to lay out fiber optic networks for gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $16 million grant, and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down. And everybody came home. And everybody started using the internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home. But please don't use too much video. And please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline, the American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed internet would just exist in the area. And it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out, all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, either just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started, and now that we are remote learning with our children, and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day, when school would start, we'd have to pack the kids up. And we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socioeconomic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and CONCAST aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple, easy, awesome. So in our area, we have a small imprint of CONCAST, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out than a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1523,2022-10-10 15:10:05
13298," Hey, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least have as long as the projects are getting started knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and the opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but there is city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, you know, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, you know, operating in the town of Nevada City or wherever it may be to, you know, quickly upload your payroll documents or something onto the cloud or to quickly, you know, swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted and that are just going to be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. Historically, the marginalized people you call them as untouchables are the leads. They have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you're born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. I think education is the best way of liberating them. So that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change not just the fate of these communities in Telangana, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, you know, source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. The greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has done.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1524,2022-10-10 15:14:06
13299," The greatest flight in India is the system of cash. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the car system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, cars remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the car system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards and high student to teacher ratios. The doctor Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Langanna Social welfare residential schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and poor. Of them, 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among them marginalized. They voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Talk to the parents, talk to the teachers, talk to the students, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting and what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium as I said English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating which reminds you of a very painful past I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past I am not saying that but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Swaro is an alternative identity, S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities like you know I am Swero and I aim to be a doctor I am Swero, I aim to be a top notch engineer I am Swero, I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am Swero I want to be a very good actor or you know musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with the identity. So I want to give an example to you see in 2012 in our institution we used to produce about 6 doctors per year but because of our you know this self liberating ideology of Sweroism we have this year we have produced.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1525,2022-10-10 15:18:23
13300," Because of our, you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Svaroism, we have this year, we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any purists of the poor people, you know, how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. But today, because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this, you know, a priest. Pujita has been a form-leberer, a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers, and this girl used to sell vegetables, but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido de campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems. And today, I'm so happy to share with you that, you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Ustman Medical College. And then in future, you know, she hopes to be a gynecologist. So, this is the journey our children are hoping for. We have the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. People are a lot of extracurricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, we have a Brazilian academy, we have a handball academy. So we have, you know, Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced gold for all. Gold fees generally played by so-called rich people, but today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. Wow. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students so that we are interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally because the poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always, programmed to feel inferior. We wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country to put it in one world. The sole aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are directly involved on these people. Their stereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were labourers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realise his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostel, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination in the universities like. In those days I am talking about the bathrooms and toilets were exclusively meant for shoulder-to-shoulder cars. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again try to excel in academics day and day. That's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to a prosperous orbit. Think of the infusion of the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1526,2022-10-10 15:22:53

The game changer is going to be a game changer for the marginalised in this country. If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit. And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanised, more developed city. And even in Singapore, what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanised and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park. An inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers, an exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1527,2022-10-10 15:26:55
13302," air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. And the more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle. And so since 2017, researchers at Cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the earthen heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them. This is the so-called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us. But vegetation can also go up the fasads of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yu in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people. And today Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Camping Admiralty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park and a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls and the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect but on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past 6 decades. That's why Cooling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your hit island effect in a city or in any building in a village as well the first place to start is by shading of the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20-25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades will be used to do that. With so many different ideas, calling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct. 4 O'clock.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1528,2022-10-10 15:31:35
13303," With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin, or duct, that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally, but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very, very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them, and if they test very well, and we are sure that they will function, then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next, and the model can be applied to any city, whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change, and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combined this scientific approach with a very well established urban redesign and design approach, through its agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Times are tough, jobs are scarce, it's risky to be outside and around others. Times like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic.

As of November of last year, yes, this was always just kind of like a side thing.

So I play a straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark And then I'll make my first video while I'm going through I've a giant no pad and just Skribbles everywhere and I make these notes of like the things that stumped me So I know the things that may stump other people What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel one? You need to do something that you're passionate about Not that you like not that you think you're gonna make money on something you're passionate about This other thing is something that other people are passionate about it holds a special place to them And third is it needs to be something that people are gonna seek out information on In order to enter into the marketplace you either need to be better than everyone else You either need to be faster than everyone else or you need to be more accessible than everyone else And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted if you understand how the algorithm works Which is very similar to Google Analytics then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start But if you're not doing it faster and if you're not doing it better than everyone else then why should in one watch your channel? So my income as a youtuber kind of breaks down to three different ways one which is the bulk of it Which is ad revenue whenever you go and you watch a video and then there's an ad and then you wait five seconds and hit the bottom right corner And then you go on to the next video or a non-skippable ad or The video starts immediately you get the little banner ads at the bottom or If you scroll down from the video the first thing that shows there is an ad Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video and all of them pay a certain amount It varies on lots of things like the country of the person who posted the country of the person who watches it The time of year where you are in the quarter if there's anything going on with a Reduction in ad revenue like great example COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising so because of that CPM went down CPM stands for a click per thousand and using the Roman numeral for a thousand and that means that for every 1000 views you get a certain amount of money now on low ads when I first started off my CPM was 30 cents so every thousand views. I made 30 cents But then once I signed with an MCN and I started making more quality content and more engaging content Some of my better videos and certain times of the year I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars And there's a big fluctuation between you know if I post a video when there's no ads being spent like January and February That's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers and also TV shows don't post new videos In that time of year because ad rates are down. Why are they gonna make content then instead? You're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher The second way that a YouTuber makes income is Support crowdfunding things like that when I first started off Patreon was really the only option But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels So whenever I have a live stream you can click a button and then you could become a member and then you get Special icons next to your name. I believe they're called badges or on any video You can hit the join button and that helps support the channel and then the third aspect of that would be merch and For me my merch has been somewhat basic in fact I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up And then an auto mod bands you You have to go through that because until you go through that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1530,2022-10-10 15:40:12
13305," views that you posted on Reddit and they say shut up and then an auto mod ban zoo. You have to go through that because until you go through that and you discover why you're doing it. You're not doing it for other people. You're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform, but basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. It is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games. They're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have to write to remain stylish. Anything you wear can and will be used against you in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh, no. It becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. I'm personable. I'm chatty. I would kind of, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games. It's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right. Now, let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra. You have to find your niche. You have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you got to make it a little more exciting. All right. Throw in a hanging bishop. Have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great, you're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi maybe and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it, my very own YouTube",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1531,2022-10-10 15:44:29
13306," getting to the like profitable point of it. And there you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends. This is live stream shopping. One of the hottest trends in China. Every night, tens of millions of people watch live shows hosted by influencers like Theia and by the products they recommend. On e-commerce and social apps like Taobao and Do-In, the sister app of TikTok. It's not about only shopping. It's about the experience. It's about having fun. You gotta see 3D, you gotta see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing. And China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G. And it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the west, live streaming is mainly the domain of avid gamers. In China, it's broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire. So it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannels. This is why I didn't know. Traditional TV shopping involves a one-way direction, whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say, call this number or something. But live streaming shopping is live. That in itself is a very, very big difference. They call this different psychology. And live streaming shopping is a very entertaining way of actually engaging someone else. So when you shop actually this live streaming video will continue. It will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by tech giant Alibaba? Added a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1532,2022-10-10 15:48:43

13308," for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they're authentic, right? So for Vía and Lichasi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Lichasi will sometimes say things, bad things about certain products, because to him there's this honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they're also very entertaining and very interesting. If you're familiar with Lichasi, he won a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications, the models in a 30 seconds. So if you're able to create a lot of bars, you're going to be interesting things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just shouldn't even use the tool manager or tool to the comedy and stuff. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live, something we call social proof and second over meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in, other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds have also started their own live stream shows. Working with very top tier live streamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governors in like small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the live streaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. And live stream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its live streaming function adding interactive features like chat rooms. Companies, including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. In the past, it started to become a part of the world and the future development space and potential are huge. Next, we will be more and more united. It will become a more daily conversation and more exciting conversation. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the Jiaqi's numbers are weird. You know that they can sell. And you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know, how they are changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with live streaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. Now let's get to the next show.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1534,2022-10-10 15:58:21
13309," The wave motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not as quickly as the wind, and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to a commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity, but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector, and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electricization generation. Since then, companies have been trying to develop the technologies at a steady pace and with a smaller cash burn. But the same questions remain. Can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough, so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that, many early wave energy projects hit rough waters, such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the Ila Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, Rano, Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline, so the wind blows on the surface of the water, causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore, this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the pause that you probably have noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 18 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a floatable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves, capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1535,2022-10-10 16:01:42
13310," So it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The wave roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the wave roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units, and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, in a braver man, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1986 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had a respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily, my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth to mouth to my frustration with saving my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Anna wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old inner co-founded EcoWave Power. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jettys and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when installing existing man-made structures. And all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power conversion unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders, which transmit by the gradeable fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a common storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100-kilowatt grade-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1536,2022-10-10 16:06:06
13311," The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Inner and Her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So, I would like to thank all of you for your support and support. Thank you for your support and support. Thank you for your support and support. So can you please tell me? No, I'm not going to... Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale that Nissan has. He is making you, you know what I'm saying? I mean, you know, it's corrod. One of the most dramatic elements was Rivendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared me like you scared Machiavellian. I love using his 16 years. So, Rivendor Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1537,2022-10-10 16:10:36
13312," The darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle. And he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gaulle. And he is now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Ravinda Passey. I am the former global general council of Nissan Motoko Limited. And you could say yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gaulle saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gaulle was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gaulle. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gaulle was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The arrest of Carlos Gaulle came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whisked him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. By that, I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gaulle about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company that in other contexts, this might have been a board action, might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutor's office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gaulle was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Posse was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle. And he was told, get to the heart of the matter, find out what Carlos Stone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1538,2022-10-10 16:14:42
13313," Get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Stone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. Yeah, it's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story we really took a close look at Harry Nada and his role in Carlos Stone's downfall. Harry Nada is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. Mr. Harry. And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Stone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Stone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made a decision to go against Carlos Stone and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Stone had to go. Harry Nada was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a longstanding relationship with him or did have a longstanding relationship with him. For many, many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nada had a plea deal with the Tokyo prosecutors. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right. It just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nada had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability. And he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Stone. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the company. Looking into the affairs themselves, Ravinder Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. Because at that point, we reported into him. You know, at the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, it was, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my god, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1539,2022-10-10 16:18:56
13314," Mission to go to Lebanon. I mean, one of my immediate concerns was, why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money been taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something. Because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues. So Rob Passey makes a fateful move. He writes this letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail backed up by evidence, backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened there, often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire, even at the highest level within Nissan, to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately, for me, I think, again, with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out. And we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the Goan Executive Conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. It eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan, where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been settled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at the global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general counsel title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First on my notice, this was around mid-Mod.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1540,2022-10-10 16:23:18
13315," driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First time I noticed this was a round mid-march, and I was driving, I can't remember where I was going, but this grey van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed, by either by people on foot or other individuals. Two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department, behaving a very, very egregious manner with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behaviour. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Yokohama? To basically do a search of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. There's no more that I would work. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are, apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court. And they hit to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again I just couldn't understand or what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. It's a confidential company email, right? You should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1541,2022-10-10 16:27:43
13316," What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it, you're on your own. And yeah, you've got to be ready for that. You've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway. This is the awful truth. There's always someone in the family that's pushing it. This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of. Expressionally, at your age with your own grandchild. My grandma is having to sue them. I'm testifying against them. Nobody's talking. They're one floor below right now. I get afraid to go on the elevator. It's sad that it had to devolve to this. It's like a soap opera, too. It's a very sad thing. It's a family feud. A family feud. Here's a family that, on paper, you would think, has the wealth that so many people seek yet. At the end of the day, it's seem to rip everybody apart. My name's Tom Schoenberg. I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News. Cover financial enforcement. I was approached by someone close to the Chattanstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chattanstein and this case that she had against JP Morgan. It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told. I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me. They included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money. Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chattanstein kind of retail empire that has, at times, included big lots, value city, American Eagle Outfitters, DSW Shoes. Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company, bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990. Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She, for many years, had that pool of money being managed by outside advice.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1542,2022-10-10 16:32:02
13317," Alphan around 1990 estimates of her wealth were around $90 million. She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisors. Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisors. She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trusty of her entire estate. Managing sort of family money is not a conflict. In fact, some ways in wealth management it's kind of how you get your start. It's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business. But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016. Well, there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences. It was hard to really put it together. She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced. So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on. She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail. So she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements. And she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. It was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not theorize or didn't know about. I was becoming very very suspicious. I would start to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going. She starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area, including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah, they came in one morning. They used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside. And then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me, you know, Don, I'm going to write my feelings in this black book. And she started writing each day, she would write a little at a time. We run the holidays of 2018. The package had arrived, the FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Don and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of $5 million over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know, Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called, you know, JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back, but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box. And that her son, Bobby, had the key to that box and that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this, you know, five page handwritten, a Memantil Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone. But why it happened, there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity, honor account. And it ended up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1543,2022-10-10 16:36:29
13318," Wonderful things and hand it out. And they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a firestorm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms, they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs through there right now. The next day, Beverly's in her place, a granddaughter still in her place visiting. Donna's there and up comes Bob, you're kind of barging through the door. And he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now. And he's furious, takes his mother and puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper, and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time. I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an X-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. It was horrible scene. Beverly brought her case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as Finra. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized. But yet we're logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. The same included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars, as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not getting any of the type of gains that you would expect an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor, finding that her grandsons, as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, were liable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for comment and JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm in that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that Finra kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son Bobby wrote her a letter. I said his sons weren't criminals, and he also admits to taking her jewelry. And he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we've received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of in a state and abused those within. Seems that it's really resonated with a lot of people. I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. She was more too old to stand up for herself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1544,2022-10-10 16:40:48
13319," Why can't I say that On April 20th oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed, went into negative territory. The price of oil has collapsed to a record oil price had fallen to zero, but the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some parts to play in what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something the breached market rules in a bid to sort of push the market and that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname, his was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then sort of scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle rose suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading and a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man but inevitably mechanization and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits and in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down a lot of the traders who worked there lost their jobs or quit or went to work for financial institutions but Paul Cummins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them were actually sort of in their 20s and they're he's you know drinking buddies some or their his own kids friends from football you know they're young lads hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got you know maybe a dozen or so traders that they're independent let's be clear but they're all part of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1545,2022-10-10 16:45:02
13320," Hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold and fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so Traders that they're independent. Let's be clear, but they're all part of this collective Yeah, I'll let Liam do it that's it's I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to You know to get into it Sweet as they say if you want to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person They would see someone who's maybe start slightly flamboyant with a some cockney accent a guy which he start accent You know not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves Don't even make sense, does he? But you know these guys they drove around very nice rolls, Royces and bentonies they went to Places like Marbaire on holiday Fade and voice is a very wealthy place you have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheob ride away from the city Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega capital London and They were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history You know anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that You know you're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glen Cores, but is this tiny firm and one of the big challenges that we had was Actually finding out who worked with Vega capital. It wasn't immediately obvious and at first we had absolutely no idea If you go to the Vega capital website, it says it's under construction if you do basic online searching It's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally They went to weddings together. They played golf together They would go and holiday together We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London a few of them started companies together So you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money So if you're an oil trader There's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI future's contract And it's basically a contract that says I'm gonna buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future Or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where their oil was gonna go up or down On the 20th of April in Essex There have been signals for a while that this was gonna be an exceptional day in oil markets And we know that some of them arose early and started their trading and the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them An obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 2.30 p.m So they're basically placing a bet that oil was gonna fall throughout the day But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between What they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for now? Of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices I'll continue to fall which means they're gonna be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day Now once it gets to kind of 1.30 p.m. That's when things start to get really interesting Suddenly there's a kind of Influox of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up now 208 p.m. Exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened Which is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for And able them to make more money",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1546,2022-10-10 16:49:35
13321," The period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office, it was a very, very profitable day. It's important to remember this has never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know, it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the Cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know, you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't. And they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk. But Cuddles and his friends were. So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of a hundred million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than a hundred million dollars in a single day were in their twenties. One of them was 22 years old. You know, only a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When we in Liam discovered that, we just couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. Oil trading is a zero-sum game. Anytime you're making money as an oil trader, someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people had put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is that oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37, men if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. Vega Capital's traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made. In the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set, they were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about when you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made seven million or ten million dollars, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to 700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately. And they basically all made up their own mind that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1547,2022-10-10 16:53:54
13322," There was people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say, these guys are at acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geysers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, the kind of social media presence they had has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. We just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. Potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fine. You could be banned from trading. And in the most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating settlements and misconduct related to trade and settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community that they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. They would be forgiven to think that we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory we need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day, they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1548,2022-10-10 16:58:04
13323," on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet, and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory, on the other side of the planet, to reduce their emissions, then you are, in a sense, offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time, and they were actually key with these international climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries, reduced their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change, much more cost-effective. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions, and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims. And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves, what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects, which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits, we saw a number of them were associated with the Nature Conservancy. This surprised us. The Nature Conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a billion dollars a year in revenues. And they've been around for seven decades. They've preserved about 125 million acres of land. They've done so many good works over the years, and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The Nature Conservancy has taken a different approach, a very pragmatic and pro-business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter, but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that, well, that's selling out, but others would say, and those at the Nature Conservancy would say, these companies have deep pockets. They can help fund important preservation work, and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm, and they've partnered with the Nature Conservancy for many years. And yeah, it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here's 20 Neries, this is the Disney World this year! One, two, three, four. If you look at, for instance, Disney. It's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel. They have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity. So these companies are trying to make major, major reductions in their carbon footprints, but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the Nature Conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges. And that's a plot of land. Most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1549,2022-10-10 17:02:31
13324," and is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly, this land, 3,000 of these acres, was actually acquired by the Nature Conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So they do what they have done so well for all of these years, which is they go out. They raise money from local philanthropists, and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time, according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website, when they were proudly announcing this deal, they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the Nature Conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast-forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project. And what they're now saying is this land is now, once again, eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the Nature Conservancy. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're drive, which they've had for decades, to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals. And they and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves, because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney, that didn't want to be interdeep for this story. But they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there. And those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange. It's called the American Carbon Registry. Now, it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects. But they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. And to some extent, you have policymakers. But the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. And the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing. Or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them. Because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1550,2022-10-10 17:06:53
13325," are happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them, because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions, and so the policies end up biasing the whole system, and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom, and that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can, but if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system. And at the end of the day, that can't really work. Have some- The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop has a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. There's a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monogale. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. For many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1551,2022-10-10 17:11:07
13326," Sky a living economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, automobile and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Hyperloop, yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum-like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short-lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperloop 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work, that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realized that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial. So drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Sara Luchian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in spaces. And there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. Three, two, one, launch. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. Yeah. We got about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop. But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. And the number one question we got from investors or from project proponents, or just people in general, was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1552,2022-10-10 17:15:37
13327," and because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe. With two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that, two normal people getting on a hyperloop. And then most importantly, those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing hyperlips will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment. To the estimated tune of around $60 million US dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs, investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect. Those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies. So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist. So who are the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability, the fortitude, to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here. Those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. In visioning the ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve, though, is fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel, traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name's Alan James. And as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmH conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmH maglev and 1,000 kmH hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for high-pollute range from 12 to 28 seats, typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool, via Manchester to Leeds by train, is just short of two hours today. It will probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. That result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool Manchester Leeds, there's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six-minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pods...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1553,2022-10-10 17:19:51
13328," a highway where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from say Liverpool to Leeds while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value, freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haulage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlubes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near-vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hybrid test facility, where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Heart Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network. That is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. That the track is divergity from one track into two. The next possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections, and in that sense you can create a complete Hyperloop network. But in the end, we'll make it possible to travel for example over over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can now travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic navigation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. In a Hyperloop because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1554,2022-10-10 17:24:09
13329," for the trains behind it, so you need a lot of space between trains. Then a high-pitched because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions, so we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects, we're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that do need to contribute to bring these two markets to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperloop development, heart in 2018 partnered with other Hyperloop companies from Europe and Canada. The goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperloop systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperloop developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to Amsterdam. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperloop tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperloop thrives. Hyperloop is such a huge project. It's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies. You need to have the governments. I think in that sense the biggest challenge that we've encountered is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. The next plan is to build the European Hyperloop Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperloop route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperloop certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1555,2022-10-10 17:28:29
13330," among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple hyperloop companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination hyperloop became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that, you know, the Wright Brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea. I think the difference now in 2021 is some brilliant engineers have spent real time grinding out the details. And I thoroughly expect the next three to five years to be decisive. The first two years, I think, are going to be a great deal of time. I think it's going to be a great deal of time. I think we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. We'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. The first two years, I think, are going to be a great deal of time. I think we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. I think we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our boot. This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage? We'll look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets, and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes.

From Bloomberg's Global Havequarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from power and cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next 10 years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War II hydrogen. And we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian Utility Company's Svam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find it mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water. Or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero. But isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totalled 117 metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andre Forest, better known as Twiggy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1557,2022-10-10 17:37:16
13332," with the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well, one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his portion from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO, and major shareholder in Fordescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fordescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Francing Laquah caught up with 24-est. There's only one type of clean hydrogen. All the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say, green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. And anyone else who produces any other rubbish, anyhow, I could just look in there and say, why is global warming accelerating if anything you're saying is true? And then you'll know, actually, it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. It's transition line is complete rubbish. Did I got put to it? Two days ago, when JCB, a really loved British company, you're in every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Fortescue, I think a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record. It worked in sick well from Fortescue, huge balance sheets, sick for strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on a green with per atom, right? Then that's a real wake up call to say, hang on. Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. Every other form of fossil fuel, fossil fuel hydrogen, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price, but what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using greenhagen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more called by power stations, called mining projects. Ever we should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue, hydrogen is cooking the planet. Yeah. So, hydrant to not matter renewable electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let alone the methane, which is worse, than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are self-harming under the guise of greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow, even if he'll look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially, so are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? OK, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on greenhagen, that actually this pollution free all the way to the supply chain fuel was now being transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any sovereign leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously, that greenhagen is never here to stay, it's broken through, history has been made, it will never go back. OK, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Oh, because we're at real risk of missing our targets. Oh, so that's really simple. Do you stop funding? Do you stop subsidizing? Do you stop using money into possibly? Right. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ask the planet on fossil fuel.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1558,2022-10-10 17:41:47
13333," It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuel subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that green hydrogen. It's kind of been pushed down, pushed down, it's also excuses, are never be commercial, they're never be supplied into quantities we need it. Now, blah blah, now we know, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically and is it worth, you know, not talking about transition, just going from A to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic person. A to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn their gas, at least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest to say, I don't mention methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon is being done, honestly. Encourage the green hydrogen sector to come in really fast. Okay, it's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper, like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now, we don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. Okay, so let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper. And it's getting more cheaper. It's the whole fuel you know. Mr. Frosche. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it. Right, to power the world. Ah, yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You could see the global warming budget start to come down. Now, we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. And he policy does all over the world to appreciate now. Okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to state that it's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm, Snam, about his new book. And why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight.

13334," music From Bloomberg's World headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Bloomberg Green. What would the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized, electric vehicles be abundant and solar and wind power homes around the world? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pave its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal and nuclear power. Our Maria today spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25% of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Cossera coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so called hard to obey sectors. And you say it's the only way in the cost of coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some argue is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour, $2,000, $10,600. Today, $100,000, and we see it going down to 50 in five years' time, and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of what is today. That's really because renewable energy, and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling, but the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot, because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it, and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions, to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen, so the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1 a kilo, which is $25 a megawatt hour. The European Union has hydrogen strategy, which is very clear, and several member states have the same. Everyone wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this, because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time, economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships in pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. And will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years, and then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale, because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India, and I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline, but when it comes to 30, he...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1560,2022-10-10 17:50:17
13335," The right fuel, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time, and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline easy jets as among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation's emissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, NEF, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green. From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex. Our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialists to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. So Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock as well as energy source, and in things like dispatchable power, long call transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost declines in the future.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1561,2022-10-10 17:57:12
13336," though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen. Because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost to clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we're usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen, but even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right, so let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that. But what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah, main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electrons struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to storeability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside, though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today, like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen, again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really, really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon capture and storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right. Great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter at climate. I'm Kiley Lines from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, and this is Bloomberg Green. And we'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of water.

MUSIC From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie. A couple of moments ago, we had the Dow Jones Industrial Abrage turn positive. In fact, right now we have got the Dow higher by one points. We are well off session lows. Stocks though, the S&P down as investors assess the potential for policy tightening and geopolitical risks taking their toll on corporate earnings and economic growth. The S&P is down 13 and dropped now with four tenths of 1% and as stacked down 62, dropped there with six tenths of 1% key takeaway though. Well off session lows, the down now fluctuating between gains and losses. No bond market trading today. We've got spot gold down one and a half percent, 16, 69, the ounce while West Texas, intermediate crew down eight tenths of 1% and 91, 93, a barrel. As for the economic backdrop and what it means for the federal reserve, SD Dwek is chief investment officer at Flow Bank. MUSIC We are seeing a competitive crash in the labor market, not quite in the non-param payroll. But the Jolt finally came down a little bit. We're seeing some softening in growth, but at the same time consumption seems to be holding up pretty well. And as we said unemployment is holding up. So so far, decent makes for the Fed, but if inflation doesn't come down over the next couple of months, they're going to continue to tighten pretty aggressively and that could definitely have pretty bad effects for 2023. Chairs of semiconductor companies are trading lower, the industry selling off globally after fresh US curves on China's access to American technology added to a disappointing start to the earnings season. Stoking concern that the industry's downturn is far from over. The socks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange semiconductor index, down now by 3%, among chip names, AMD, which you recall plunge 13%, 14% on Friday. Down now 3% of 1% Intel down 1.1% Nvidia lower by 2.8%. Recapping S&P down 4.10, Simon Charlie, Palatin, Dad is a Bloomberg Business Flash. MUSIC This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. All right, struck yourself in everybody because it is going to be quite a week. I'm ready. I think that's a fast end, yeah. Man, all right, it's Monday, October 10, 2022, Carol Maser, Tim Stenevick, Live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. We are streaming on YouTube and it is a jam pack week. We've got Fed Minutes coming, BigBank Earnings, we've got reads on retail and that all important inflation. And once again, we've got stock bouncing around. They're lower, but they're off their worst level. Yeah, we just heard the numbers from Charlie, but they're worth repeating the S&P 500 off its lowest, but still down 4.10% of 1%. The Dow flat right now in the Nasdaq down 6.10% of 1%. It's rough for though, if you're a chip stock, we're going to talk about the semiconductor names because President Biden on Friday, new technology curves on China when it comes to technology specifically in that semi-space. So we're going to talk about the impact and what it means. All right, we've got also got the most powerful buyers when it comes to US Treasuries. They are all bailing at once. A great story there. Absolutely. Plus an expert on Vladimir Putin on his latest aggressions and threats. And I saw this cross last night and I thought to myself, Shri definitely wrote this story. So we got a great one with him and exclusive. It's about Goldman Sachs domination and Reese Witherspoon all in it. We knew we had to do it, Carol. What, legally blonde? She can't fix it. Okay, that's the story.

13338," Faculty strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence on the phone from New Jersey. Let's kick it off with you though. Crety, we're, you know, several hours well into today's trade just a few hours away from the clothes. What sticks out for you in the trade today? Well, I think it's the move that you saw in the last. I want to say a couple of minutes. And this is a move that you've been seeing. I want to say for the last 30 minutes or so, the S&D 500 was down almost 1% at a one o'clock. And then kind of made a turnaround. And if you actually were to look cross asset, we know the bond market is closed. So the volume is already a little bit light when you aren't able to make those kind of cross asset correlations, especially right now when inflation and the Federal Reserve is kind of dictating the moves. But take a look at the dollar, which kind of serves at least in my mind. Does a little bit of a proxy for what the bond market is going to be doing, given that in the past few weeks, months, years, as you see yields move up. The dollar follows as well. Well, the dollar has been paring some of its gain or for the session. It's only up now, two tenths of 1%. But with that move lower in the dollar, the stock market paired some of its losses. So to me, it kind of feels like it's very sensitive to the currency picture, at least on an intraday basis. Hey, Gina Martin, Adams, come on in here and give us your impressions. Not just of today, but also what we got to watch for when it comes to earning season because you and your team have a great note out about mega caps for capitulation coming this earnings season. Yeah, thank you. I think pretty much it today's trade on the nose. The only thing I would add is just the technical, the market did go back and test its most recent low hit on September 30th and bounced off of that low. So clearly some buyers jumped in back at the low, the recent lows that we made in September in terms of the earnings outlook. You know, the bar looks pretty low, frankly, for the third quarter specifically. But I don't know that the investor base cares too much about the third quarter. What they really care about is what's coming into 2023. And there's some really intriguing things in the consensus analyst outlook anyway that really are our question of all the first is, really what's happening with the mega cap stocks and with earnings underneath the headline because what is expected to happen in 2023 is that ex-energy earnings are actually supposed to start to accelerate next year. In the face of a declining sort of outlook for broader economic growth and a deteriorating outlook for sort of momentum in the economy to have that sort of turnaround. Pending in consensus is a bit of a disconnect. So I think we've got to see that disconnect close over the course of earnings season. And much of that turnaround is anticipated to come from the big mega cap stocks where many investors have clearly concentrated their bets where valuations are still very, very high relative to the rest of the market. There's still this sort of undying faith that the tech companies can really pull us through into 2023. So this is, Gina, when you talk about this disconnect gap closing, it's not a case of the outlook getting better but rather those valuations coming down to reality. Yeah, I think that's a lot of it, Carol. And the valuations really suggest what is in consensus is a possibility, right? If the consensus thinks that we're going to see an earnings turnaround in 2023, valuations may be anticipating that earnings turnaround or at least suggesting that any weakness that is exhibited in this group as has been the case for the last couple of quarters, it's somewhat temporary. So will it actually be temporary as a huge question going into the next couple of weeks? All right, we'll speak into the next couple of weeks before we get to the next two weeks. I want to stick with this one week, CREDI, and give us an idea of Fed Minutes, big bank earnings, retail, and then of that inflation report that we get CPI. We're still what, expecting 8.1%. 8.1%. Yeah, I mean, of all the things that I just mentioned there, which one is the most important? You know, it feels like a no-brainer to say CPI, but I'm going to have to agree with actually a guest who is just on my show just a second ago, Blurina Uruchi, the Tiro Price, a chief US economist, and she said it was actually retail sales. Interesting. That was going to be the bigger mover. What did Vince tell us last week? He said inflation was more important than earnings. Yeah, well, everybody's got a view, but I think it will tell us about the consumer who's been so important and key rights and economic momentum going. Right, especially in the context of, and Paul Sweeney mentioned this earlier today, but especially in the context is the fact that so many retailers are discounting their inventory by so much, you want to make sure that you still have that retail buying momentum. Because at the end of the day, net net, you really want to make sure that this holiday season specifically is going to still be a growth period for the US economy and to Gina's point. It feels like there's so many things that are kind of primed for a bounce back now. Right. I think retail sales would be a good way to offer. It was going to be your real Ford 4200 houses really. Now Switch.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1564,2022-10-10 18:10:50
13339," economy and to Gina's point, it feels like there's so many things that are kind of primed for a bounce back now. I think retail sales would be a good way to hook your narrative onto that. I just kicked something under my desk. I'm really sorry. There's a whole group. We're going to talk with the folks over at Adobe about the upcoming retail holiday season. There's already story in the Bloomberg about many retailers already out trying to pump up the sales ahead of holidays. Hey, Gina, just 20 seconds left here for big bank earnings in particular. Any thoughts we should think about real quickly? I think the market's going to be looking at these earnings pretty carefully in particular, low-moss reserves. What's happening with actual loan extensions? What's happening with the deposit rates as well? And sort of the competitive landscape with money market accounts. How are they losing these assets and not increasing deposit rates? Is a huge question on investor's minds. Yeah, these are all really important issues. Guys, great setup for what will be a very busy week. Our thanks to Crety Gupta and Greg Markets' correspondent at Bloomberg here in our studio, Samart Adams, chief equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, on the phone from New Jersey. All right. Well, let's get to Washington, DC now, from New Jersey, from New York City, we go. Nancy Lyons is standing by in our DC newsroom there with an update when it comes to world and national news. Hey there, Nats. Thanks, Tim. Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning of more attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine. That's if Ukraine continues what he calls terrorist acts on Russian territory, a likely reference to a recent explosion that damaged a major bridge from Russia to Crimea. No one has claimed responsibility for that. Ukraine meanwhile is pressuring the U.S. in Europe to provide more air defense missiles. After Russia's missile barrage today, Bloomberg's Amory Horde turned with more. I spoke to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry this morning what they are seeking for from the international community is more of these types of air defense missile systems, as well as they want international community to label Russia a terrorist state. Bloomberg's Amory Horde turned reports delivery and training on those air defense systems could take weeks. A pro-Russian group is claiming credit for a series of disruptions that temporarily knocked offline. The websites of some U.S. airports, the group called KILMET, has engaged in a series of cyber attacks in recent months against Western targets, including incidents that officials stay temporarily sent some state government websites offline last week. Well the man accused of driving an SUV into a Christmas parade last year in Wisconsin, apologized to the court today for his behavior during the trial. Darryl Brooks, who is representing himself, had to be removed from the courtroom last week after repeated outbursts. I would like to issue the court an apology from me. Barks is on trial for killing six and injuring dozens of others in that attack.

With this story, we want to dig a little bit deeper into it. About a pro-Russian, hektivist group is claiming credit for a series of disruptions that temporarily knock the websites of some U.S. airports offline. Yeah, the group is called Killmet. It's an engagement series of cyber attacks in recent months against Western targets, including incidents that temporarily rendered some state government websites offline last week. That's according to cyber security experts. So Los Angeles International Airport lacks issuing a statement saying that its website was partially disrupted and that the interruption was limited to portions of the public-facing website. There were no disruptions to internal airports systems, nowhere there any operational difficulties according to the statement. So, that's pretty important there. Absolutely. And it's not just LAX site for the Gordy Airport was also affected in addition to Des Moines International Airport. That was coming from ABC News. Websites for O'Hare and Midway airports in Chicago were offline today, according to a statement from the Chicago Department of Aviation, but no airport operations were affected. So, interesting.

And we were watching a screen of just in real time the cyber attacks that come into Taiwan from China. And we've had it from the perspective of just your own personal finances.

You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business week on this Monday, while geopolitical tensions, heightening, following comments by President Vladimir Putin, who threatened further missile attacks on Ukraine after Russia hit Kiev and other cities in the most intense barrage of strike since the first days of its invasion, marking a dangerous new escalation in the war that is going on much longer than everybody anticipated. At the same time, a warning from President Biden of fundraiser in recent days, ascending shivers down many people's spines around the world. We've got a great guest with us this afternoon. Angela Stan is Senior Advisor for the Center for Eurasian Russian in Eastern European studies. She joins us on the phone from Washington, DC, her most recent book, Putin's World, Russia against the West and with the rest. Angela, really good to have you with us this afternoon. Where do we begin with the most recent action in Crimea, in Russia, and of course, in Ukraine as well, in terms of how this conflict could spread even beyond those borders? So Putin obviously has escalated the conflict since the attack on the bridge to Crimea a couple of days ago, and there was this really indiscriminate bombing all around Ukraine, major cities losing all their electricity and water, and some of them still in the dark, so real attacks on infrastructure, but also indiscriminate attacks on civilians. Children's playgrounds blown up, shopping malls blown up, you know, this is not these aren't military targets. So this is Putin's way of saying, you know, we're going to really fight back. He's just appointed a new commander of all the troops and the Ukraine operation, a man called General Sura Viken, who has a reputation for being particularly brutal from the Syrian civil war, and down he's even served time in jail, and he, you know, didn't waste any time having just been appointed after Putin was criticized for not doing it off in Ukraine, and clearly this is his first act. And as Putin has warned, this isn't the last one. So what does that mean? How do you interpret that? How would you advise world leaders with comments like that? Well, I think I have to expect more of these indiscriminate bombings. However, we do know that Russia has, there's not have an infinite supply of these long-range weapons, and they may run out of them sooner, maybe than they themselves want to admit. I think world leaders have to, you know, re-double their efforts to support Ukraine. There is going to be more pressure from some people on the Biden administration to supply even more lethal and long-range weapons to Ukraine. Things that President Tolesky has been asking for, and no doubt will ask for again, when he is beamed into this emergency G7 summit to discuss what's happening. So I think that's where the emphasis will be, and there will be, have to be a discussion, is there more that we could be doing, particularly with air defenses to help Ukraine send off these attacks?

13342, will be and there will be have to be a discussion is there more that we could be doing particularly with air defenses to help right you crane you send off these attacks Angela as Tim mentioned your latest book is on Vladimir Putin Putin's world Russia against the west and with the rest getting side Putin's head as much as you can for us and tell us tell the world what we need to be nervous about right now well the Russians aren't winning this war I think Putin's grip on powers now weaker than it's been at any time since he came to power 22 years ago he just celebrated 70th birthday he thought he was going to leave this legacy of conquering Ukraine so he is from his point of view cornered he's under attack from people who are more hawkish than he is to show that Russia can win so I think we are the dangerous moment I think we can expect more escalation at least in a conventional way I'm less concerned about these nuclear threats although you know President Biden as you said alluded to them before because Russia can do an enormous amount of damage to Ukraine without going nuclear why are you less concerned about the nuclear threat here because it wouldn't you know using a tactical nuclear weapon it would set the Ukraine back a bit but it wouldn't really accomplish the kind of territorial gains that Putin is trying to make and it would really by breaking it to boot like that it would alienate a number of countries that up till now have supported or be neutral would it begin world war three well it would begin with world war three if it escalated from one tactical nuclear weapon to strategic nuclear weapons the ones that can reach the United States and some people say we've never had a situation where someone's used a tactical nuclear weapon but in fact it would escalate quite quickly and then that would be world war three shivers up my spine just by even talking about this hey Angela before we got into this interview we Tim and I talked about a pro-Russian activist group claiming credit for a series of disruptions that temporarily knocked the websites of some US airports offline you know it's traditional warfare if you will using you know ground war missiles and so on but it's also a cyber war how do we need to think about that as Russia as you said President Putin certainly feels cornered at this point so I think we should expect in fact people have wondered why there haven't been more of these kind of cyber attacks the German train system in the last couple of days were suddenly disrupted in northern Germany who did that so I think we these kind of asymmetric cyber attacks are probably what's going to happen in the future and we have to be well prepared for that and we have to know how to strike back against that too what does this mean potentially for Taiwan China and everyone else well I think for the Chinese were they're watching what's happening in Ukraine and they're seeing how the Ukraine's are fighting back so they might wonder how the Taiwanese also equipped with American weaponry might fight back and then they're watching the sanctions that were imposed on Russia and presumably those kinds of sanctions would be on imposed on China so I don't think what's happening is going to embolden China I think it would give them force for thought before they did anything all right 30 seconds left Angela a potential off ramp for Vladimir Putin what could it be I don't see an off ramp at the moment because Putin wants the whole of Ukraine so there's nothing at the moment I think that would work as an off ramp unless Ukraine were willing to feed an enormous amount of its territory which is not willing to do is it just Ukraine or is there more in his sights 10 seconds oh yeah I mean he would like to go further than Ukraine and that was his goal at the beginning yeah doesn't look as if that's what he'd like to know so appreciate you Angela Stent Senior Adviser Center for Eurasian Russian in East European studies check out her book Putin's World Rush Against the West and with the rest you're listening to Bloomberg Business Week on Bloomberg Radio Putin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1568,2022-10-10 18:27:39

13345," You're right, the idea that Goldman Sachs, the merchant of high finance, has been there for 150 years going on to Main Street. The symbolism of it all is what caught our attention. But when we look at Tim's question about what went wrong, you can really put it into three distinct buckets. There's one bucket that says, bad strategy from the get go. Those are the people who never liked the idea of Goldman getting into consumer. It was too far away from their knitting. Shouldn't have gone there. But another camp that will tell you good strategy, bad execution and that's a third camp, which I would assume is senior executives at the firm right now, who will say everything was fine, but we responded to the facts as they presented themselves in front of us, a changing economy. And we are being smart. And the benefit of having a nimble organization like Goldman Sachs is you're able to course correct before it gets too late. Maybe all three apply to some extent, but it really is a big move when you had Goldman Sachs going direct to consumers, going with Marcus with jingle, swarming their waves, reality TV show stars to advertise their products and whatnot. And from there, you're basically saying, we're going to reign it in, take it back into our well channel, really promoted through that specific category, which has its advantages because Goldman Sachs is a big wealth powerhouse. We talk about banking and trading, but wealth is another area where they're really, really strong and they can market these products. They have a workplace offering. So you have a targeted employee based to target and you can go to them with these products, checking counts, robot advisors, Marcus insights, which was clarity money, savings accounts, but it really never was meant to be for mainstream or at least that's the realization you seem to be getting from senior management inside Goldman Sachs right now. Right. The panel is not the masses, is it mainstream at this point? What does it do to, you know, when we think about future growth for Goldman or another avenue? Is it really that important ultimately? Let's look at why they got into this in the first place. Post financial crisis, a lot of the banks have been looking for that business model which will last through the good times and the bad times. The Ghibli JP Morgan already had it, a big national and international consumer commercial enterprises as well as a strong investment banking franchise. Morgan Stanley found it through its focus on wealth management and bolstered it with its acquisitions of each trade and even months in the last few years and Goldman Sachs had been searching for it for too long. It was too reliant on its core business, which mind you is undoubtedly the best on Wall Street that a lot of people will agree with exceptional talent, exceptional performance, great banking, great trading business, but shareholders were not loving it. And this management team that took over in 2018 under David Solomon has desperately craved a higher multiple from the markets, even if you look at it today. And that's what it all boils down to. Look at the price earnings ratio on Goldman Sachs stock, about 6.66 JP Morgan, eight in change. Morgan Stanley, ten in change. Right, difference. The exact same thing, if you give me some of the same multiple that you're giving me, giving my arch rival like Morgan Stanley, this stock is not $300 today. It's $400. That's the story they want to sell. That's the story they have not been successful in selling. And this little bit of whiplash from this foray deep into consumer and pulling it back is going to make it a little harder for them. So they will have to talk to investors and now again explain why they must reward Goldman Sachs better than they have been doing. And it feels like it is going to be hard sell because if investors are willing to buy it easily, it would have already happened. How much of a pullback to you anticipate will happen, Shree? What do you know from what's going on internally? Because they still have what have a hundred billion dollars in customer deposits. That's a lot of money. And that's very important because that's one part of the business that will remain in place that will they will try and make sure that that grows because diversifying your sources of funding, finding a cheaper source of funding is extremely important for a bank like Goldman Sachs and consumer deposits help with that. They have a transaction banking business now which is effectively corporate deposits. That helps with that as well. The change you're going to see is if you look at this business, think of it as there is a direct to consumer channel and there's a business to business channel. The business to business channel is what you know of as Apple card, the GM card. Those are the partnerships Goldman's hand. The Fin Tech it purchase last year in Stormman loans provided a green sky.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1571,2022-10-10 18:40:49
13346," And as to business channel, the business to business channel is what you know of as Apple card, the GM card, those are the partnerships Goldman's hand. The Fin Tech it purchase last year in Stormwind loans provide a green sky. Goldman executives still swear by these large partnerships. They see these as opportunities that can continue to grow that will be a creative to returns. Where they're really pulling back is this direct to consumer channel where there were a lot of expenses involved and they're hoping tacking it on to its wealth channel. Biggie backing, biggie backing of the success there will be much better for them going forward. All right. Well, interesting and it's certainly something we've been hearing from Goldman for years about their interest in wanting to really dig into this. So you really get all the details on what happened. Shree, thank you so much. Of course, we said a most red Bloomberg big take and it's in the upcoming issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine. And of course, big thank you to Joel Weber as well. Let's get over to world and national news with Nancy Alliance and Washington DC. Hey there, Nets. Thanks, Tim. President Biden is condemning what he calls quote the utter brutality of Russia's missile barrage at civilian targets in Ukraine. He calls it a significant escalation of a conflict now in its eighth month. Today's attacks were in retaliation for the recent explosion. The damage to bridge linking Russia with Crimea. Former US Defense Secretary Mark Espertell's Bloomberg, it was more of a strict more than a strategic slap in the face to Putin. He's a personal project of Vladimir Putin. He opened the bridge in 2018, personally drove a truck across it. So it's not just that strategic significance, but it's a real punch in the gut of Vladimir Putin. Mark Espert says we need to quickly provide Ukraine with anti aircraft systems. Some of the nation's airports are dealing with cyber attacks today, originating from within Russia. That's according to those briefed on the matter, airports in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta were among those targeted. With less than a month to go until the November midterms, Republicans are engaging in a messaging and legislative barrage against transgender people that they hope will win over voters. Last month alone, a candidate for Michigan governor proposed to build barring transgender girls from women's sports teams. A congresswoman in South Carolina put out an ad accusing her opponents of supporting child abuse, and the Senate candidate in Arizona retweeted an ad slamming his rival for supporting gender affirming care. The strategy comes with Republicans on shaky political ground on other social issues. Most Americans align more closely with Democrats on abortion rights, and even a small minority of Republicans supports same-sex marriage in a recent Gallup poll. In Washington, I'm Nathan Hager, Bloomberg Radio. Global news, 24 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts. Nancy Lyons, thank you so much. Nancy Lyons and our Washington DC bureau. So the all mighty powerful weatherman. He's making news today. Of Wall Streetism. We're talking about Jamie Diamond. This one, crossing the terminal a little earlier, Jamie Morgan Chase, CEO Jamie Diamond said, quote, serious headwinds are likely to push the U.S. and global economies into recession by the middle of next year. We should note, these comments coming from an interview today with CNBC. Yeah, here's the quote. These are very, very serious things, which I think are likely to push the U.S. and the world. I mean, Europe is already in recession, and they're likely to put the U.S. in some kind of recession six to nine months from now. Again, that's the quote. And just in terms of our reporting, the U.S. economy doing well at the moment, you know that. A number of indicators and global issues, the impact of surging inflation. We get another read on that this week. Interest rates going up more than had been expected. The effects of the Fed and in quantitative easing. And then you've got Russia's war in Ukraine, which we just talked about. Among them are ringing alarm bells. That again is the laundry list from Jamie Diamond about the things the global economy has to deal with. This is the part that really got my attention, Carol. He said the S&P 500 may have a ways to go when it comes to its decline. Instead, it could be another easy 20%. The index right now down almost 25% so far this year. Here's what he said quote, the next 20% will be more painful than the first. He told CNBC rates going up another 100 basis points are a lot more painful than the first 100 because people aren't used to it. By the way, did I say the index is down almost 25% or did I say almost 20? It's almost 25% this year. It's down a lot over this year. And there is something to say if you think about the markets how long they were like, no, no, no, Fed, maybe isn't going to do it, isn't going to do it. We saw that back and forth. There's so much volatility this year. It would be a substantial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1572,2022-10-10 18:45:18
13347," If you think about the markets how long they were like, no, no, no, I said, maybe isn't going to do it. Isn't going to do it like we saw that back and forth. There's so much volatility this year. That would be a substantial decline. And that would I feel like take us back to levels pre pandemic to some extent. So we got earnings coming up from the big banks. Yeah. How should we read these comments in the context of what's to come? Well, we'll see what they have to say. We heard Gina Martin Adams saying she's going to be watching some of the loan numbers, loan loss reserves. We'll see what those bank CEOs have to say about the macro environment. And that will give us an idea of maybe what's to come and more and what Jamie has to say. But that's the next week. Well, just go ahead. Go ahead and play을 예약하게 듣cker.

Spot gold is down 26 dollars, the ounce lower by 1.5%, gold right now 1668, the ounce while West Texas, Inemidia crude oil is down 2.1% at $90.67 a barrel. So again recapping here, the Dow, the S&P Nesda stack all on the minus side, Semicaductors stocks remain among the worst performers. I'm Charlie Palette, and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. All right, Charlie, thank you so much. Well, she is on fire. Recent Bloomberg Business we cover story and the dollar problem for the world. Remember that just recently. And then today out with one of the most red stories on the Bloomberg about how the most powerful buyers in US Treasuries are all bailing at once. It's what I call a weight what moment? Liz McCormick is chief correspondent for Global Macro markets with Bloomberg News. She's with us right now in the Bloomberg interactive brokers studio. Liz good to have you with us this afternoon. So where are the biggest players going? I mean, we're talking about pensions, life insurers, foreign governments, US commercial banks. Where are they going? Well, a lot of them are sitting in cash. I mean, of course there's the Fed also who they're not a trader, right? So they're doing QT now. So instead of buying like QE, they're rolling stuff off. And they were the biggest buyer of Treasuries in the last couple of years, right? Commercial banks, you know, as deposits are going down, you know, I know you were talking about Jamie Dimon, but as the Fed is pulled back and there's less reserves, deposits are going down also because the interest rates on banks are not so good relative to some of the other high yield things. So they have less money to invest in Treasuries. Some of it there's less money like Fed, commercial banks, other foreign accounts, some of the local bond yields are pretty nice. Yeah. And the hedge yield in the US is kind of negative, you know. So how much, and I think in your story you say, if it was just one of the overseas buyers, right, it wouldn't maybe be such a story, but you're talking about like all of them or most of them or many of them. Yeah, the major ones because you know sometimes even like, in the wonky world of supply and demand, editors will be like, ah, that doesn't matter too much. Yeah, let's go away. Yeah, I don't know, that's not a good story. But when it's like the big players are all going in the same direction, that's like a flow story that matters, right? So I think that is the story. Like, and JP Morgan's done some good data on it, breaking down that the key buyers, and they're saying, we're a little concerned here, you know. You have these players, especially like commercial banks who bought so much as all the liquidity came in, going the other direction. I mean, I keep saying to myself, it's a mix of this now supply demand that's working against treasuries, and although we don't know what ends, inflation's still staying hot, although Lyell Brainer said some caution, but the Fed's still being hawkish. So they're both a negative for the treasury market. Well, that's what I'm thinking. We think about how high yields are go, right? I mean, this is a conversation Tim and I have with our TV colleagues of, you know, where's the bottom inequities and where's the top and yield? So that's another dynamic that plays into pushing up yields even higher. Exactly, and I feel like, my daughter says, you don't do that, you sound old, but like, I feel like I've been around for a while, and sometimes I almost like, oh, this peak yield thing, like a three and a half yield when treasury 10-year yields were there, I'm like, that's not so bad if you were around a long time, you know, we're just kind of used to the zero rate era. So I think that's the thing, the doors keep getting blown off. Like, oh, we couldn't go above four. Now, of course, we went above four in yields. And the Fed might go to 4.6. And along the Bloomberg economic says 5% of the terminal rate. So I think that's the hard thing. Are we at the peak? No, you know, it's scary, right? You don't want to buy when you think it could be worse. Exactly. Well, that's the question, Liz. I mean, what gets these institutions, these governments, to get off the sidelines and move from cash back into, you know, treasuries.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1574,2022-10-10 18:54:18
13349, you think it could be worse right well that's the question is i mean what gets these institutions these governments to get off the sidelines and move from cash back into you know treasuries well as far as the central banks i think they're back to the wall right uh... because they for now have to do this qt although the bank of england did a finessing thing of a market structure kind of uh... you know kind of call it financial stability support as you know for the long end i think the foreign private accounts it depends on when you'll get attractive enough right maybe when the dollar eases off because that's making hedging cost more expensive it's all relative value if it gets more appealing they may come back or in the u.s. was first and well let's not say first but fastest with hiking right so maybe if if we slowly get signs that they're going to at least and i don't like the word pivot but maybe slow to the thinking pal select retire transitory let's retire pivot please you know too last week it's a long time in one of the at one of the shows without actually saying i kind of pointed out which is a bit yeah and i really brought it back but um... but that's what i think what i think we need to see like the white to the eyes of the fed actually slowing you know i think it's a bad inflation so when maybe they finally do a fifty right this point i can split a supposedly we're looking for another seventy five that's four in a row i mean that's a lot so is it just a a market cycle when it comes to treasuries because i guess what i always think about is we need foreign buyers to buy us that right that's what you know keeps the u.s. government going so is it something more than was talked about this with you know in regards to china if it gets to be political will china stop by but is it is it just a case of where in this is a market cycle we're in right now and that's why you foreign buyers pulling back or is there something more plain we need to be concerned well you know it's interesting on the foreign buyers account they have been member china was such the force and they have if you forget about this this recent stuff they've been slowly less of a force you know i'm number one because the fed is bought a lot but you know foreign accounts haven't had as much sway as they had let's say ten years ago because they were the main force everyone was worried like oh my gosh if john moves away um but they still matter a lot i mean when i say they have less force you know save for months and months their amount of holdings went down but they still hold a heck of a lot right so i think it's a market cycle and we're eventually going to have a recession i mean um i want to say Bernanke where's my brain but pal is said we're trying to get the back of the bell price and he's all over today but pal is trying to pull this off without a recession maybe a soft landing but you know history shows that probably we're going to have a slow down that will start like you're saying the cycle okay let's go down investors will come back yes exactly it's a worth because central banks are in such a pickle right now is it worth distinguishing their goals with the other institutions that usually buy up for a debt whether it's a sovereign wealth fund for example or perhaps a pension fund right uh... absolutely there their goals and desires are much different right i think that's why a few folks in our story said whoever these buyers are there more price sensitive because the fed although they do models and try to buy the right spots they're not buying you know for like a relative value player anything but you're right pension funds because they need these long-term investments and you start to hearing more investors saying i'm starting to like longer term to you know duration securities i don't think it's enough of a force that it's moved the market around although we do have a deeply inverted yield curve right that's kind of because the recession coming but i think you're right and that pension funds really need this secure but they're very overfunded now you've probably talked about that so they've done very well with stocks before this year so they have less of a need but i think that that kind of money is going to come back because it makes me even think about all newties like usually a bad word but yield to higher right we may not have a great was invested in a new case it is amazing the things that we're talking about right that we thought kind of had had their day in the sun i think it's a really powerful story in terms of where we are in the market right now um... so let's thank you so much in twenty seconds investors should think that about what that maybe we're going to see even more higher yields yeah i think you can't say you know too easy we're seeing the peak and i like you said buyers are going to come in but it doesn't seem like right away anytime soon so a little more caution yeah well certainly another thing to keep in mind let's thank you so,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1575,2022-10-10 18:58:14
13350," And like you said, buyers are going to come in, but it doesn't seem like right away anytime soon. So a little more caution. Yeah. Well, certainly another thing to keep in mind. Liz, thank you so much. Liz McCormack, Chief Correspondent for Global Macro Markets at Bloomberg News, as we mentioned. Recent cover story of Bloomberg Business Week about the higher US dollar and how they didn't care about the impact it was having on the world so relevant to what's going on right now. Yeah, good to have you back with us. Liz, really appreciate it. And congratulations on the recent cover with Bloomberg Business Week. Let's get another look at the market. It says we get less a little over an hour into the start of trading. Into the end of trading, I should say, the down, down, about one tenth of one percent. The S&P down, six tenths, and the NASDAQ down, nine tenths of one percent. Yeah, off our best and worst levels here, and of course, the bond market closed for the Columbus Day holiday. We're checking with our TV colleagues. We're going to talk about the markets. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on Bloomberg Radio. Coming down to the close, Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage ahead of the US market closed starts right now. This is Countdown to the Close just 60 minutes left in your trading session. Caroline, hard-remain boss, the retailer. It's joined her by colleagues, Carol Masa, Tim Stenevich. We together welcome audiences no matter how you consume as TV, radio, and YouTube. And we're currently off our lows of the day on a stock market that remains open. Yeah, absolutely. Uh, bouncing around once again, but we continue to see some pressure on the semiconductor sector. It's a group that, in Caroline, you talked about last week. We all talked about last week. Socks down about three and a half percent. Of course, on Friday, we heard from the Biden administration a new round of curbs and restrictions on the group and specifically on the way chip companies.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1576,2022-10-10 19:02:40
13351," It's down about 3.5%. Of course, on Friday, we heard from the Biden administration a new round of curbs and restrictions on the group. And specifically, the way chip companies do business with China's tech industry, we're talking about US. We've also talked about AMD, the warnings that keep coming out. So this group, in the last three days, we've seen about on an intraday basis, about a 10% correction, Tim. So certainly a lot of pressure on these names. Oh, also seeing some underperformance and the automakers in the S&P 500, namely Ford and General Motors, Ford down 6.8%, GM down 3.6%, taking a beating after a couple of firms come out and it gave warnings about earnings, falling profits for US and European car companies are set to drop by half next year. That's a quinter to UBS. They actually talked about an oversupply of vehicles, which is something that we haven't seen in quite a while. RBC capital markets says that 2023 estimates for the sector need to, quote, move materially lower. We're seeing that play out in today's trade. Meanwhile though, we are looking, in general, lack of volume on the day. Some people taking the day off, of course, hot school, certainly are S&P 500 off by 6.10 percent. The Dow is off by just a tenth of a percent, but both the volume's lower than usual. The Nasdaq off by 8.10 percent, volume's down by about 9 percent on the day. The Russell 2000, it's off by 4.10 percent. So small cuts also went a pressure. Some 50, 50 with a bigger tilting, of course, here to the downside. Remain you talk about the staples, which is higher by about 4.10 to 1 percent. But then you get materials and industrials, and that feels sort of like a cyclical trade. That is higher on the day. But then you go down to the bottom energy once again and under performer. You're off about 2 percent. Tech is well off about 1.3 percent. That is the big tilt to the downside on days like today. Yeah, on the downside, and we've been keeping eye on stocks. But keeping eye on some of the software companies out there as well, Snowflake shares, down about 9 percent, that drops 7 percent on Friday. A lot of talk now about what happens this earnings season for those companies that, well, don't have any earnings. Snowflake hasn't posted, at least not on a gap basis, any profitability since it's been public and even on an adjusted basis. It only did that for one quarter there. Those shares down 9 percent on the day at the bottom of your screen, keep an eye on 5.9 in the same space. Those shares down 24 percent. They came out with some preliminary numbers and their CEO resigned here. So a lot of people now concerned here about what we could hear out of some of these software companies as we could deeper into the earnings season. Also keep an eye on the casinos when resorts down 12 percent on the back. Plus some weak data coming out of Macau. And if you're looking for a few bright spots interesting story here on the Bloomberg Terminal involving Exxon mobile, potentially considering a bid for Denberry, Denberry shares up about 6.5 percent, we should point out that Exxon did actually respond to this in a Dow Jones story saying that right now they're not going to comment on any speculation about who or who not. They may be interested in. We won't speculate what we will look at though. What we're speculating about earnings season, aren't we? The whole direction of travel where we're going to go and if indeed the third quarter is going to be as bad as it gets. At the moment, we're likely to see an especially actually still manage to claw into positive territory up about 2.6 percent as well. But boy have we lowered our expectations over the last few weeks. And though it looks as though for already audience that this may be as bad as it gets. We're likely to rebound into the fourth quarter at least and in general seem to think how. Yeah, interesting. We talked with Gina Martin Adams earlier and she said what's really interesting is what companies will ultimately say about 2023 in terms of the outlook. Having said that when it comes to outlook, I feel like we know clearly what the Fed wants to do. The latest to weigh in is Charlie Evans, of course, the president of the Chicago Fed Bank. And he was speaking at a conference in Chicago and said really supporting and justifying the aggressive stance that we've had from the Fed so far. Listen up. Front loading was a good thing given how far below normal neutral rates were. But overshooting is costly too. And there's great uncertainty about how restrictive policy must actually become. And of course, that's the president of the Chicago Fed, Charlie Evans. I thought it was interesting when he had to say about great uncertainty about how restrictive policy might actually become. He noted that demand for goods is still very strong, but he did also say about conversations of it, I think various businesses and so on talking about starting to see some weakness when it comes to the labor sector a little bit. Yeah, but not enough weakness at least, not right now. And that's what we certainly saw. That's what we certainly saw last week when it came to the most recent non-farm payroll as number romaine. But at the same time, there's a lag when it comes to the effect of monetary policy. So if they overdo it now, then how ugly could it be in a few months? That's the concern. Yeah. And we should point out too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1577,2022-10-10 19:06:59

Yeah, and we should point out too. I mean, this is the drumbeat from the Fed members. We're going to hear from Laura Demester at that same conference. And this is also a global story we had headlines a little bit earlier from Espinoza over at the Mexico Central Bank basically talking the same thing. That inflation is persistent. It's still here and there needs to be a policy response that sort of meets that to some degree. So, you know, brushing off any sort of talk that central bank should pivot or pivot anytime soon. And perhaps not add a healthy dose of fiscal spending to the equation when it's untargeted. That's of course going to be the momentum. Who would do that? Who would do that? Who would do that? I mean, no eyes are a line. Care for. Cross the Atlantic. But, I mean, the pressure on the UK market once again was torrid. And we're thinking about what the IMF, the World Bank, are going to be saying throughout the week, there's going to be so much lamenting coming from finance minister's anadise central bankers. And I think that we heard some comments last week that the risk of not acting in the face of this inflation still outweighs the risk of overreacting at this point. And I think that that'll be a consistent Fed message until we hear otherwise. You know, layer on top of this, Liz McCormick was on with us. She's got a great story in the terminal. And just talking about all these typical, you know, normal buyers, massive buyers of U.S. treasuries, how they are backing off and how that will certainly feed into higher rates. So, we've got, you know, global central banks, the Fed pushing up rate, tire. And then you've got to layer this on top of it and that's going to put some pressure on the rate environment as well. Why is Taylor here today? I mean, Taylor, the bond market's closed. You know, he'll think the day off. He'll think the day off. He'd be wonderful colleagues at the same thing. Oh, did it. I think my message has been taken. Next time the bond market's closed, I am too. How about that? I mean, I'm not saying we don't want you here. Well, no, you just did apparently. Well, barely you guys did also. No, no, we don't feel it. We just thanked her. We thanked her for her presence. And for her read, it's all about the framing. The market would actually be doing if it was. Yeah. Anyway, look, I mean, it's a good thing that she's here because I mean, this is a busy week. We talk about the kickoff for the next season. But really all the economic data that we're going to get, the Fed speak. I mean, there's a lot here that has to be parsed, if you will. That I think is going to really sort of drive a lot of all utility in the markets this week. Not to mention retail sales at the end. CPI still above 8%. And where are we in terms of oil prices? Then what will that mean for the overall rate of inflation in November, December? And then you mentioned, I mean, Carol, kicked it off with that conversation about the Biden administration on chips. I mean, could that be sort of another add to the inflationary pressures here if that continues to move through? Vicks moving up to more than 1.32 52. So we are certainly seeing that react to some of the volatility we're saying. All right, folks, we're going to be back in less than an hour's time. Our conversation on the markets will continue on radio TV and YouTube. We call it Beyond the Bell. We will be back to cutting down the clothes on this Monday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevick on Bloomberg Radio. Man oh man, NFIB, Small Business Optimism, PPI, CPI, Weekly Jobless, Retail Sales, that's your week. Oh, and the big bank earning. So just go, go, go on the Bloomberg Terminal. What I did. And you have to scroll down just to get to Thursday. I know. It's not even, you know, it's so many. By my calculation, we got what, close to, wow, 30 economic data points coming this week. Break down right. The individual reports have several components. We'll get, you know, University of Michigan sentiment as well. So we'll really get a good take and that'll be for October number. So that'll be more recent. Wow, close to, wow, more than 25 actually. Yeah, it's a lot of stuff. We're going to say PPI mortgage applications. FOMC Minute. CPI, initial jobless claims, retail sales, import price index, sentiment, empire manufacturing. And then every time you say, and I'm going to say another one. And then big bank earnings. So JP Morgan kicking it off. Was it a Thursday morning? We didn't get to talk at all about that just now in the summer cast. No, we didn't. We did mention just briefly earnings. But I also, I think, once again, we always look forward to what the CEOs have to say, how specific they are about the outlook, how far into the outlook they can predict. And so Gina Martin Adams talking about the big bank. She's going to be watching low-loss reserves, probably low in origination and what they say about the environment. Yeah, she said who cares about last quarter, who cares about the current quarter. We're thinking about, you know, what happens next year? 2023. Yeah. Right? And whether.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1578,2022-10-10 19:11:28
13353," The loss reserves, probably lone origination and what they say about the environment. Yeah, she said who cares about last quarter, who cares about the current quarter. We're thinking about, you know, what happens next year? 2023. Yeah. Right? And whether that, whether things slow down enough that maybe the Fed can stop raising rates and put a change in terms of the environment. All right. Well, let's go from a New York City and our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio now to Washington, DC to the 991 newsroom where you find Nancy Lyon standing by with the check of the world and national news. Hey there, Nancy. Thanks, Tim. Biden is condemning Russian missile strikes today that hit cities across Ukraine and joining in his outrage as European Commission President Ursula Vonderlayn. I am shocked and appalled by this vicious attack on Kiev and other Ukrainian cities. Russia once again has shown to the world what it stands for. It is terror and brutality. Those who are responsible have to be held accountable. Ursula Vonderlayn says Ukraine knows that the EU will stand by its side through to the end. Today's explosions were apparent revenge strikes for a blast on a bridge linking Russia with occupied Crimea. In the U.S. Several airport websites were knocked offline by pro-Russia activist group LaGuardia, Oher and LAX were among the websites that the group claims to have disrupted. John Holtquist is head of the intelligence analysis at the cybersecurity firm, Mandient. It is essentially superficial. It does not necessarily mean that any back-end resources are being affected or that has been lost or anything that your operations have been affected in any way. Mandient's John Holtquist says similar attacks have occurred throughout Europe in the past. You may remember last month's risk of a rail strike that threatened to bring the nation's supply chain to its knees, with Biden administration brokered a tentative labor agreement. But today, we're learning the majority of the nearly 12,000 unionized railroad workers have rejected the deal. The workers want better pay, working conditions and sick leave policies. Four labor unions have approved the pact and several more will vote through mid-November. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts and more than 120 countries. I'm Nancy Lyons. Thank you so much, Nancy Lyons, in our DC newsroom. So we want to bring you a story. This has to do with New York, asking a federal appeals court to prevent an order overturning firearms bands in Times Square and other public places from going into effect. Okay, like most New Yorkers, people who actually live in New York, I don't spend a ton of time in Times Square, but I was walking that way on Friday to bring some clothes back to a retailer. By the way, everything was packed. It was crazy. I was like, what am I doing? Was it torso, or could you tell with it's torso? Yeah, yeah. Which is good. I mean, it's great for the economy. Right, because we had no tourism for a lot. But I'm waiting for a light to change over by what fifth avenue I guess. Okay. And in the mid-50s, and I see a sign that says that's attached to a street light that says no guns allowed. And I'm thinking to myself, what is this sign here, but this article explains it. Yeah, exactly. I did attorney general, Latisha James, today filing a motion with the second US Circuit Court of Appeals to stay a lower court decision that was issued last week that found many of the state's gun restrictions unconstitutional, such as stay would remain in effect while the state formally appeals the ruling. I will say, I think it's safe to say for many people who are in and around New York, whether you live here, you commute in and out, the idea of like guns on a subway would just freak me out. I remember somebody once just even just flashing a knife and like getting into it and that freaked me out. But I can't even imagine like seeing somebody looking over and they're holding a gun. You know, they've got a gun. I don't know. Yeah, it's terrifying. I mean, at least it is for me. US District Judge, a Glenn Sutterby in Syracuse on October 6th ruled that several provisions of a gun law passed in your live violated the constitutional right to bear arms. The Consilt Carry Improvement Act, which greatly expanded the number of public places where guns were banned, was enacted in response to the US Supreme Court's decision overturning the state's previous restrictions on Consilt Carry permits. Yeah, the judge saying that banning guns from Times Square, public transportation, bars, sports stadiums, and a host of other public places was impermissible because there was no historical basis for those restrictions. Unreal. Yeah, this is just one of those sticky issues that we're trying to figure out. You know, I guess day two. Clouded areas? Yeah, and I just, I'm already...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1579,2022-10-10 19:15:37

I don't want to see guns involved. I don't want to see guns involved. I don't want to see any guns involved. I don't want to see guns involved. I don't want to see guns involved.

Let's head right over to the first word breaking news desk for today's afternoon call. Here is Bill Maloney and good afternoon, Charlotte, US stocks mixed in a quiet tape today. Like you said, the Dow is trading higher by 10 points. S and B's are down 12 and NASDAQ paying losses to 56. The bonds are closed. Gold is now 24 energies in the red. And Bitcoin is trading lower by 1.4%. Among the main 11 SB sectors, leaders were materials and industrials, energy and tech led to the downside, and leaders to the upside in the Dow, Walgreens and Merck, while Salesforce and Microsoft were under pressure. In DL News, Dow Jones reported that BioRed Labs isn't talked to the buy with QGen. It would be a $10 billion deal, and XonMobile set to weigh a takeover of Denver. Rappling things up on CNBC, Jamie Dimon said the S&P 500 route may have a ways to go, and that it could be another easy 20%. Live from the first of breaking news desk on Bill Maloney, Charlotte. Okay, we thank you very much, Bill Maloney, and to hear live breaking news over your Bloomberg-type squawk SQUA-WK on your terminal. I'm Charlie Pellett. That is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. So we were just talking about that. Not sure if you saw last night, 60 minutes. A piece on the tensions around Taiwan and China's actions toward it. Segment touching two on the all-important role of Taiwan via the massive semi-giant headquarter in the country. We're talking about TSMC Taiwan's semiconductor plays when it comes to the world's chip supply. So for the next 30 minutes, we're going to do a deep dive into the world of semiconductors, strategy around the companies, the stocks, and the geopolitics. Geopolitics. Well, speaking of geopolitics, we got also US curbs on China's access to American technology, also adding to the mix here. We're going to dive into all of this with a great group of guests. First among them, Eric Schatzger is editorial director for Bloomberg New Economy. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Eric, when you think about ships, I mean, in this day and age, they're in pretty much everything from cars to air conditioning units and refrigerators to, of course, AI technology. Where should we be thinking about them or how should we be thinking about them in the context of new economy and in the context of the global economic environment? Well, as you point out, they're everywhere. So you should think about them in almost every context. Would you believe that there are one trillion ships manufactured every year? A trillion. It's nuts. But of course, not all semiconductors are made equal, and that is the point here. The dinosaurs among us remember the era of the personal computer, the IBM PC sitting on your desk, of course, that was the introduction of the Intel semiconductor. But since then, they've migrated to smartphones to rocket ships. There are 3,000 ships on average in a typical electric vehicle. They're in your refrigerator. They're everywhere. And again, harkening back to Intel versus AMD. Remember those days, this used to be a corporate battleground. But it's no longer a corporate battleground. This is a war being waged by governments. Tim, you were talking about the most recent restrictions imposed by the Biden administration. On Friday, the Commerce Department imposed these restrictions on technology exports to China. And they are the most aggressive to date. The government's objective here is to limit the sale of semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Chinese customers. Why? Because they want to limit the development. And I say they, this is the US government. And there are lots of other people outside the US government who are concerned about this, too, want to limit the development or constrain the development of technologies that may pose a threat to US national security. And potentially, the Western way of life, you could think about it in those terms. It is borderline existential. The Chinese see this as a race they can't lose. And the United States and its allies have come around to that same point of view. How does Taiwan semi-fidget into all of this? Of course, located in Taiwan, which certainly China lays claim to. We'll see it maybe differently. And maybe the world sees it, obviously, differently, too. So how do they play into all of this? Taiwan semiconductor is something of a unique company. It's what's called a foundry, which is to say that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1581,2022-10-10 19:24:17
13356," really differently too. So how does how do they play into all of that? Taiwan semiconductor is something of a unique company. It's what's called a foundry which is to say that they don't design their own chips. They make chips based on other people's designs like apples designs for example. And they are acknowledged to be the very best semiconductor or at least advanced semiconductor manufacturing operation in the world. There are only three companies that can manufacture what's called a five nanometer line width. This is the extremely narrow circuits on the surface of a semiconductor that function as the, you know, they conduct the electricity and they allow a semiconductor to work its magic. It's TSMC, it's Samsung and it's Intel. And the reason we care about TSMC is opposed to other foundries. There's a company owned by Mubatala for example called global foundries that has fabs in upstate New York. But the reason we care about TSMC so much is because they can function or at least they can manufacture at these extremely narrow line widths creating faster, more powerful and more efficient chips that are critical for artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, the stuff that is and will change the world. We haven't even talked about supply chain disruptions related to COVID because when we've been talking about chips that has been the context for the last two years. Where are we on that, Eric? It's still a problem for the automotive industry. In fact Tesla and Polestar both in the last couple of weeks cited a lack of access to enough semiconductors as a manufacturing constraint. On the other hand GM recently said that the picture on as far as semiconductor supply is concerned was beginning to alleviate, although they too were still having trouble getting everything that they need. Polestar situation was interesting because and this is the EV spin off of all of them. They actually have cars that are in the process of being manufactured which they can't complete because they need the chips. So this is still a very real issue for the automotive industry. But now that we have an economic slowdown underway and the threat of a recession looming if in fact we aren't early in one, you can begin to see that effect on the PC and wireless chip industries and in particular DRAM. This is the memory that's in your phone or in your computer. All of a sudden there's tons of that stuff available and in fact memory chip makers are beginning to cut costs and limit production because a glut is beginning to emerge. So 30 seconds left got to just kind of wrap it up here. So when we think about that. Are you saying that I don't speak in short sense? No I love you can go on and on and you can stay forever. But when we think about the new economy and when we think about the tensions that are impacting the semiconductor, what do you think our audience has to think about? Think about and this is the title of a conversation that will happen at the new economy forum in Singapore next month, the geopolitics of technology. I don't think you talk long. By the way I saw my first... It's very full and informative and all that stuff. I saw my first pole star out in the wild in Brooklyn. It was pretty cool looking. Yeah it was cool. Some people don't think the styling is quite aggressive enough but I'll leave it to others in the forum opinions. Alright that's Eric Schatzker.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1582,2022-10-10 19:28:16

Bloomberg 960 to the country. Sirius XM, Channel 119 and around the globe, the Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio.com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. All right, you are listening to Bloomberg Business Week. We just cut up with our Eric Schatzger, Bloomberg New Economy, who really got into foundaries, the importance of Taiwan, semi and the geopolitical tensions increasing between the US and China. I ran out of time, have a lot more questions when it comes to chips. Is that okay? Yeah, could we have another smart dude coming out? Yeah, Mandy Singh is going to be joining us in a just a minute. He's Senior Tech Industry Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. But first up, we got less than a half hour to go, Charlie, Paul. It are on track for another losing day for stocks. Certainly, semiconductors among the weak spot today. Let us begin with the socks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor stock index down now by 3.3%. Speaking of those chip names, advanced micro devices, we had that plunge on Friday, today down another 1.4%. Intel down 1.7% in video, lower now by 3.3%. Stocks on track for another day of declines as investors assess prospects for policy tightening and geopolitical risks taking their toll on corporate earnings and economic growth. S&P 500 index off session lows at a choppy session, but still down 19 points to drop there of 5, 10th of 1%. The Dow is down 14 points to drop now of about 1 1 1% as decked down 83 at a client of 8 1 1%. Spot gold down 1.5%, 1668, the ounce wall West Texas Innovative Crude Oil is down 2% down 90 83 a barrel. As for the market backdrop, Megan Horniman is chief investment officer at Verdance Capital Advisors. This week I think the biggest risk is still the economic data. Clearly there has been some rise in the geopolitical risks that I think is taking a little bit more height and risk to the markets this week than we've seen previously, but still the number one thing I think is the economic data. We have a lot of inflation information, we have fed minutes, and then don't forget on retail sales when we finish out the week as well. Home improvement retailer lows is trading lower after being downgraded to hold from buy at R5 capital lows, lower now by 0.8% and Kathy Wood, whose innovation-themed ETFs have plummeted in the area in the era of rising rates is taking the federal reserve to task for its aggressive tightening campaign. In the latest market commentary from her firm ARC Investment Management, Wood has penned an open letter to the Fed expressing concern, but Central Bank is making a policy error with its rapid rate hikes. The shares of ARC, the exchange traded fund, the arch-innovation ETF down now by 3.3%. And that is a Bloomberg business flash. Wait, I'm not done. I'm trying to get a semiconductor gif file. Gif file, I didn't know how to say it. Carol, I know. I'm just saying, because I'm trying to tweet out because we have another great guest to talk about Silicon Valley. What do you think semiconductor gif gonna look like? I don't know. The stuff coming up is a little wacky. All right, so let's continue our deep dive into the chip world. This has shares of semiconductor companies that have failed today, the industry selling off globally. We talked about those fresh US curves and China's access to American technology. So we got to dig deeper into the fundamentals of this sector. Yeah, we're very pleased to have with us this afternoon. Mandy Singh, Senior Tech Industry Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. He's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive of Broker Studio. Mandy, if I take a look at the socks and what it's at a 52 week low, just today down another 3.1%. Given the trio of challenges, I mean, we're not talking just supply chains anymore. We're also talking about geopolitics here and then US curves on exporting certain technologies to China. How does the chip industry recover? Well, so there are a couple of things going on. One, you have that headwind from just clients side of things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1584,2022-10-10 19:37:16
13359," Well, so there are a couple of things going on. One, you have, you know, that headwind from just, you know, clients side of things, whether it's PCs, smartphones, the demand for that is going down. And there is a big inventory kind of problem that all the companies chip companies, whether it's Intel, AMD, Nvidia, they have. And you see that on the PC side and gaming side. More hitting DRAM companies? Memory was, you know, separate memory is always early when it comes to, you know, the inventory buildup and it also comes out of that blood situation before everyone else does. On the chip side, these are the logic chip makers Intel, AMD and Nvidia Intel has a highest exposure to PCs. Now, we know consumers pull forward their PC refresh cycle during the COVID situation. And we saw above trend growth. So now we are naturally falling off that, you know, above trend growth. And you see that desoloration on the smartphone side. People are somewhat reluctant to refresh their smartphones, even though we know iPhone 14 came out, but that has been slow. What was really working for the chip makers was autos and data center. Now, we're starting to see some cracks on the data center side and data center spend is coming from the hyper scale cloud guys, whether it's your Amazon, Google, Microsoft, they're the biggest vendors on data center chips. Now, I think that is really going to hurt the chip makers and it's still not priced in the stock. It hasn't, you know, been reflected in the estimate cuts. So that is the one area that was very strong. And we think that will be the next shoe to draw. So fundamentals, right? This is what creates cycles within the semiconductor industry. That's one big major component. And then you layer on top of that, right? The geopolitical. Yes. So geopolitical look, no one knows. And even the curves were more like, you know, on the leading nodes, so super computers, Chinese trying to build their own super computers as is US based companies. So what US is really restricting is the access to equipment when it comes to building those super computers, as well as the leading node technology. And so that is going to hurt the demand side, but not as much, unless China retaliates and says, okay, US based companies can't sell their chips to Chinese customers. And that is when it's going to really cascade. Are there companies in China that can make up for what the US is not allowed to provide China with anymore? No. So Chinese companies don't have those leading edge equipment. So we're talking about ASMR, lamb research. These are the EUV equipments that you need to produce those leading edge. It's TSMC, one of those as well. TSMC is just a foundry that manufactures all those chips. And it is using a lot of those leading edge equipment from the US and the European companies. But it's a very quick. So would TSMC be impacted? No. So the curves were strictly on the Chinese. China mainland. China mainland. And so far, what China was trying to do was to build their own technology, their homegrown technology, and it comes to super computers and these latest chips. But a lot of the US companies Apple being the classic example, 98% of all their hardware is assembled in China. Right. So a lot of the chips go to Chinese customers, it gets assembled and then it gets shipped back for being sold in the US and other countries. So it's not as easy to untangle those supply chains because China is one of the steps in terms of assembling those products. And that's why I feel like if China retaliates and says, okay, if you're not going to allow AMD and Nvidia to sell their chips to our customers, that becomes a problem for Nvidia and AMD. But also a problem for the Chinese economy, right? There's a lot of workers that we just got about 15 seconds, right? That would have an impact. It's certainly and that's why there are no easy kind of cases here in terms of how it may play out, but clearly it is interconnected. It's definitely complicated.

Mendeep Singh always uncomplicated things, though, for a senior tech industry analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence here in studio. To world of national news in Washington, DC with Nancy Liance, we go. Hey, Nance. Thanks, Tim. The European Union is describing Russia's missile attacks today on civilian targets in Ukraine as war crimes. Today's attacks followed Vladimir Putin's accusations that Ukraine was behind a recent attack on a bridge connecting Russia with Crimea. Kiev was among the cities that sustained damage today with the city's mayor of Italy, Klitschko, vowing they will not be defeated. People is angry. Angry in one to defend our houses. Defend our families, our children. Klitschko says more than 40 people were hospitalized and the death toll could be even higher. Florida residents are bracing for a long recovery following Hurricane Ian. Today, Governor Ron DeSantis pledged state support for businesses and homes and communities that were hit by Hurricane Ian's onslaught. We haven't forgotten you. We understand that there's a lot of current needs, but there's also just going to be a lot we need to do over not just days, weeks, months, but even years. And so that's going to be something similar that we're going to see here in the Southwest Florida communities. DeSantis announced today the state is awarding an additional $126 million to 24 communities along across the Panhandle that we're trying to rebuild. New York is asking a federal appeals court to prevent and order overturning fire arms bands in Times Square and other public places from going into effect.

Nancy Alliance in our 991 Newsroom in Washington, DC. Carol Master Tim Stenevich we're live in our Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio here at Bloomberg headquarters in New York, also streaming on YouTube. This next story we want to share with you. It is among the most red on the Bloomberg all day. It's ugly out there. Yeah. Yeah. And we're in well rock capital management. We're among stock picking hedge funds to report September losses as equity markets tumbled. Chase Goldman's Tiger Global fell 4.4 percent for the month extending its decline for the year to 52 percent. That's according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing the results. The New York based firms long only fund-toubled 9.6 in September to bring its year-to-date slide to 66.5 percent. We should note that the S&P 500 right now or the year-to-date is what down close to 24 percent. And the Nasdaqs down about 32 percent. Dow, if you care, it's down about 19 percent. So talk about underperformance. So yeah, the flagship fund at well rock dropping 6 percent in September, widening its loss for this year to 41 percent, according to those in the know as some of its biggest equity investments sourd in the firm was forced to write down the value of some private investments as well. If you know the market environment, we saw the S&P down, nine more than 9 percent last month, all on growing recession fears and expectations as the Federal Reserve will continue to hike interest rates to combat inflation, ultimately the concern is the Fed, even if it, you know, either overdoing it with the rate hikes, what kind of slowdown it creates, what kind of recession it ultimately creates, and then how that plays out in companies in terms of growth. There is one like there is. In this story that's not actually underperforming, Carol. We're talking about co-to management. It fell 1.5 percent last month. It's declined for the year now is at 18.7 percent. So it's performing better than both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100. This is according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. We should note that Tiger Global Boston based well rock declined a comment. Co-Too did not immediately respond to requests for comment. And I think this is pretty interesting because we play around as do a lot of these hedge funds. Many startups are slashing cuts, a cost cutting staffs and seeking additional liquidity as fundraising becomes more difficult. So that's also a play here.

I'm Charlie Pellet, that is a Bloomberg business flash. Thank you so much for that update, Charlie Pellet. We do really appreciate it. It is 3.48 on Wall Street. The following is an editorial from Bloomberg opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. Yet again, troubled at a big European bank this time, Credit Suisse has been oiling markets, concerns about the cost of an expected restructuring have set its share price, gyrating wildly in recent days. In response, executives have said that the bank is among the best capitalized of its peers. If only that were more reassuring. While the biggest global banks have more capital than they did during the last crisis, experience and research suggests they'd all need even more to survive a severe shock and have enough left to inspire confidence. The tempest surrounding credit sues shows that the world's largest banks are too fragile. The prescription for policymakers is simple. Hold the line on capital and keep pushing for more. The danger of having too little exceeds that of demanding too much. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg editorial board. For more Bloomberg opinion, please go to Bloomberg.com slash opinion or OP. I end go on the Bloomberg terminal. This has been Bloomberg opinion. I'm driving in my car. I turn on the radio. How about you let me drive? Oh, no. Who's going to drive you home? Honey, please, how does the drive? Drive-os. Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question of the drive system. This is the drive to the close. That punk community will drive up to the dawn on Bloomberg Radio. All right, everybody. Just got about 10 minutes left in today's trading session. Just under 10, bouncing around here. We're definitely off our lows of the session, but we are down. Certainly across the board, you just heard from Charlie when it comes to the major equity averages, though, tech once again, though, the under performer, Tim. Really eager to hear what Jordan Cont asked to think about it. This is Jordan. Is a chief investment officer at ACM funds. Jordan joins us this afternoon on the phone from Los Angeles. Jordan manages the ACM Dynamic Opportunity Fund. It's ticker ADOIX. It's actually outperforming the S&P 500 this year. You're to date down only 11.3% versus the S&P 500 slide of close to 25%. Jordan, good to have you with us this afternoon. Help us understand where we are within the context of, wow, the slide that we're seeing in the S&P 500 this year. What the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control? Yeah, I think a lot of this started with the Fed. Obviously, the Fed was behind the curve in terms of inflation and characterizing it as transitory. So they had to catch up and start hiking rates at a pace this year, much faster than we've seen probably in decades. And so that kind of caused valuations to contract. Risk assets to start coming down pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pervasively. And now what we're getting into is this second phase of the downleg where earnings estimates, which had held up for most of the year, are only just starting to be revised downward. And so I think that kind of weakened the valuation thesis, so to speak. And so this is going to be a really important earnings season in the sense that do we see more companies guiding down and taking down numbers and just how well the market can hold up in the face of that sort of scenario? Hey, you're other fun. Your ACM tactical income fun. If I look at it, it is in the 93rd percentile for the past month. If I look at it three year, it's in the 81st percentile. And this is your investing in bonds. You're looking at floating rate bonds. You're looking at debt. You're looking at muni, high yield, foreign and emerging market issuance. Where are the opportunities?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1588,2022-10-10 19:54:30
13363, says you know you're investing in bonds you're looking at floating rate bonds you're looking at debt you look at muni high yield uh... foreign and emerging market issuance um... where are the opportunities there you've you've done well you're to date and in particular over the past month what has worked well for you in terms of strategy you know in that fun that you're talking about in our fixed income fund we uh... utilize fixed income ets pretty much across the spectrum you know all the different sectors of the six income area and we do so in a tactical fashion so when when any given area of the fixed income market is in a downtrend we will move to cash and so what has really helped us is just being altered the fence of recently you know we have we have high amount of cash in that fund and that has kind of really helped us a few things that have that have held up you know things like bank loans floating rate uh... bond have held up a little bit better than the rest of the market we also have been my right in about sixty percent is in cash right now i mean the onlookin at numbers maybe is that right and that's not typical and it's just a function of you know we allocate the sectors that are experiencing uptrend in the market and we can add to them you know as as those uptrends kind of uh... take hold and strengthen and so right now that those uptrends are just so few and thought between that we have a really really high probably the highest cash amount of the top of the twenty twenty so a bear would you say that it is a bit of a safe to say a bearer stance in terms of the the the fun right now yeah i think so i mean it is a bearer stand just because that like you said there are so few opportunities but a lot of these areas of market and the fixed income market are really getting oversold here that come down quite a bit yields are much higher than we've seen in years and so i think as soon as the market gets a sense that inflation is peaking uh... and and and ten year you'll start to stabilize more you know i think there could be a lot of good buying out there to be but for us and we're not going to put the part for the horse what is what is your sense of inflation peaking here because if he's going from eight point three to eight point one percent when it comes to cp i is that evidence that inflation is peaking or has picked i think so you know they've been always like to say one data point doesn't make a trend so you need to see it persists for a few months but one of the things you know people kind of don't often differentiate between inflation is a rate of change measure on a year-over-year basis it's not a measure of prices so even if prices stay high right here in l.a. gas prices are six dollars and fifty cents even if prices were to stay at that level let's stay for the next year that the the inflation rate on a year-over-year basis would start to come down and trend toward zero you know as as those comparisons can can't be for a shun but prices would still be high it would be difficult for the consumer but it's not an inflation can come down even though it doesn't necessarily feel like it when you're looking at the average crisis hey Jordan your dynamic opportunity fun to and correct me if i'm wrong but according to our data as of the i guess the last update it's about about fifty three percent in cash uh... you also own some it looks like alphabet and amazon some elyly some Microsoft that feels like a high level to what will signal to you that it's time to put that cash to work in either of the funds for that matter but you know i'm just curious what are you looking for what's the trigger yeah and the dynamic fund you know we're holding some of those core positions like you said that was a little but then on the flip side we use short position in in e-tf and indexed yes and that's kind of how we had to our exposure so even though we hold those stocks you know we have a lot of hedges on the e-tf side and that has limiting our exposure for us and just helping us act offenses and this down market so for us you know we we've followed a lot of different indicators one of the simplest one for your listeners is we look at the market the major indices things like the s and p the nasa at the rossal and we kind of overlay a series of moving averages on them so we look at both short term in the new to turn as well as long term right now the market is below you know if you look at the s and p for example it's below all of it major respective and there are actually in down turns if you look at the scope of those new averages so for us you know we just need to see a change in trend we do the market start to break back above those new averages and for some of them to actually bottom out and,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1589,2022-10-10 19:58:55
13364," So for us, you know, we just need to see a change in trend. We need to do through the market, start to break back above those new advantages. And for some of them to actually bottom out and start sloping upward again. And that's kind of how we define the trend, the overall trend of the market. And right now, the market is still just stuck in a downtrend. When do you, what's the signal to you that things are on an upswing? And it's not a bear market route. Well, I mean, I think you're going to have to be able to do that. And I think, you know, it'll be a few things. You know, I mentioned the technicals. The technicals are obviously a big part of it when we start to see the markets swing back above those new advantages and the slopes change. Also, you know, it's very rare for the market to bottom while the Fed is still hiking rate and a lot of yield curve is still negatively sloped. Right. So a good indicator that we've been looking for is the yield curve to bottom out and move to a positive slope. Right? That would be an indicator that the bond market, at least, is pricing in some growth ahead as opposed to right now where it's still forecasting recession. Right. So things like that. All right. Good to leave it there. Hey, Jordan. Thank you so much. Jordan Connys, Chief Investment Officer and President at ACM Funds joining us on the phone from Los Angeles. Just a few minutes left. And today's trading session. We're going to head over to our TV colleagues for Beyond the Bell live on Bloomberg Radio, Bloomberg Television and YouTube. We are counting you down to the close on this Monday. Beyond the Bell. Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market closed. Start right now. And right now we are two minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romain Boston, Caroline, high. Taylor Riggs counting you down to the closing bell. Here to help take us beyond the bell. Our global signal cast with Carol Master, Antim Stenevich. Welcome to our audiences across Bloomberg Television and Radio as well as on YouTube. Carol, take a look at the S&P right now. Is it 36.13? I just want to point out, at one point on the day, it got down to 35.88. That's about four points or so away from that 52-week intraday low. You know, exactly where I was going to go. Because I saw it when it was at like, was it 35.85? I feel like, and it was testing the September 30th low and bouncing off of it. Our Gina Martin Adam saying that was kind of significant to see that it tested that and then bounced off. And it feels like that's the tone getting so close to some of those lows but kind of working its way back off of it. And at the high it was at 36.52 so we saw quite the range today up more than three tenths of 1% but at its lows down more than 1.4% so significant range. And I think that speaks to the volatility that's starting to pick up in the equity markets. There's lag to cause when you're looking at the volatility that you usually have in a bull market that's shot today or indeed the FX. But the fact that the VIX managed to peak almost basically at 34. We're inching closer to some of those levels that people will start to say, okay, is this capitulation level? Yeah, we had a great interview with Scott Bauer of our Prosper trading account, who's done some great research into World of VIX but really then the backwardation, the inverted VIX curve and really expecting more short-term volatility. Maybe some calmness on the horizon but for me it released the volatility this week I think that the markets are focused on. Yeah, and this could be sort of one of those weeks where we get a big reset to the upside or maybe the downturn persist here. So we should point out that some of the big names like the apples and necklaces of the world are higher here on the day as are the Wal-Mart's in the Merx. But then of course you add the chip makers really kind of deepen the hole here on the day and a lot of the software names as well. You add it up and you get an S&P 500 that's going to finish the day down by almost 8% down roughly by 28 points. Right around that 3612 level the Dow Jones industrial average down about 94 points or 3% of a percent. While the NASDAQ composite is going to fall 110 points or 1% here on the day, the Russell 2000 that's only down about 6% of a percent and we should point out the Dow transport to manage the day in the green, believe it or not, higher by 5% of a percent. Yeah, pretty interesting. We talked about this earlier in terms of one group that was really battered today. We're talking about those semiconductor names down about 3.5% if you look at the socks in today's trade. We're going to have to do with more regulations and oversight if you will coming to from the United States to China's tech industry. And so that really battered a lot of those semi names. Yeah, Carol, you really saw a tilt to the downside when you think about some of the individual sectors as well for the radio audience. We can look at the sectors within the S&P 500. The best performer still have some red in them. For now, it's a lot of the food and beverage, the food and staples, even some of the materials that were up about maybe one half of 1%. But then...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1590,2022-10-10 20:03:25
13365," We'll have some red in them. For now, it's a lot of the food and beverage, the food and staples, even some of the materials that were up about maybe one half of 1%. But then all of the tech hardware that Carol was just mentioning, a lot of the chip makers, if we go down to the bottom, I mean, semi-conductors, we're off about 3.5%. Some of the software, software, conservators, hardware equipment as well, off about 1%. So you are really getting sort of that big tech sell off here today too. All right, check it out in terms of some of the gainers because there were a few of them. And this was top in the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100. We're talking about Walgreens boots alliance. That stock got more than 4% in today's session, bouncing off of a 10-year low, shares of the company, they did hit that 10-year low on Friday. That's after Mizuhu's security is called, the company arguably the most debatable stock in our coverage universe as it faces competitive inflationary and macroeconomic pressures. That was Friday, got a bounce back today, keep in mind we have earnings, they're due out on Thursday. All right, Moderna also top of the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100. I couldn't find any real catalyst. I'll be it. We did see social media volume on the stock surging today. So there was a lot of conversations happening certainly out in the world of social media. We get earnings in about a month, early November. And then I thought this was interesting. Boeing up 1.6% off its highs of the day. It was up more than 4.5% at one point. This is after a report noted that the first commercial, 737 Max flight appeared to have resumed, flying into China for the first time in almost four years. So a pretty big up movement when it comes to Boeing shares and certainly significant development to him. Such a huge market for Boeing. Let's talk some of the software companies that moved lower today. Romain, you mentioned Snowflake earlier and you talked about software companies moving lower. Microsoft, so it's not just the unprofitable companies. The ones that don't actually have earnings. Company like Microsoft down more than 2% today, really weighing on the S&P 500, weighing on the NASDAQ 100 on a point space is the worst performer in both of those indices. In video shares, falling 3.4%. Chip company's falling today. We've talked about the new US curves on China's access to American tech. 52 week low for Nvidia at its lowest level today. It was actually trading at levels last seen since August of 2020. The stock's closing at its lowest level since November of 2020 as well. And then Rivian, finishing the day down by more than 7.2% after the EV maker said it's recalling almost all of the vehicles delivered to its customers after discovering a minor structural defect. The company did say they only found this on 7.7 of the vehicles. But the CEO did say that a fastener quote may not have been sufficiently torqued and it is recalling all of those vehicles. Pretty dow a day for Rivian. Pretty dow a day cross asset, really. The only bright spot once again on the day on the year is the US dollar, which is pushing higher. We had a risk of a sort of a day, geopolitics, loom large, Russia, Ukraine, the tensions, reamplifying there. And of course, not to mention some concern between trade of US and China. We see therefore the dollar go higher. And indeed, it means we've got weakening across the board. The Aussie dollar off by 1.2% is commodities roll over. We see also the QE weakening by 8.10% in some of the European, the pound under a lot of pressure. Even as the bank of England is step-ting to transport its own bond market, the market testing, some of that resolve. We're looking at commodities that are down across the board after the run-up that we've seen in oil. It was notable that Brent crude was off by more than 2% so too was WTI in the face of perhaps some of these geopolitical tensions. And really across the board, you saw metals roll over. And sovereign bonds, we know that the US was closed, but we see yield-appearing yields push higher. Ostr in 30 are up by 20 basis points. Germany, the 30 are up by 17 basis points. 18, remember that big deal being struck that Germany at last might capitulate, might sell debt together with the rest of the EU support that move, enable to shore up some of the rest of the EU when it comes to the energy price rises. But these aren't grants, these are loans, Taylor. I feel so lost without my normal yield chart here. But we'll just sort of use this time to kick off again through the market's reaction, really sort of the big economic data that we're expecting. Carol, for me, as I know it is for you, a big CPI report. It was interesting though, I was reading some information from Omer Sharif, you know him over inflation insights. And he cautioned a little bit that the core inflation month of a month that could decelerate, which is a good thing, to just about three tons of one percent. But the last time that happened, it then re-excelerated after that. So there's definitely going to be a lot of nuances within this data. Yeah, absolutely. It's September data, but nonetheless, it'll be something we'll be thinking about because it's a key or what lasts.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1591,2022-10-10 20:07:47
13366," celebrated after that. So there's definitely going to be a lot of nuances within this data. Yeah, absolutely. It's September data, but nonetheless, it'll be something we'll be thinking about because it's a key or what last inflation right, we're getting down to thinking about the next Fed meeting and what they're going to have to analyze. I want to go back to it. I can't believe I missed it. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon, which was down a lot in today's session. I know. I think you talked about it earlier, right, in terms of the gambling. But it does make me think about, we travel coming off of the holiday there, the Golden Week holiday, COVID flare ups. I mean, when this economy continues to struggle, you do think about what's the global impact on everybody else. We're seeing that global impact right now with the chip sector because China is such an important customer for so many chip companies. Having the US come out and say, you know, you're not allowed to sell certain types of chips, certain types of technology to this entire country has significantly concerned the analysts who cover the space. The student of the bill have been a complete surprise. I mean, I understand the knee jerk reaction, but we've been moving in this direction now for months. And you could probably make an argument that we've been moving in this direction for years. But it's another layer, right, on the semiconductor stocks that are already facing problems, whether it's lower PC demand and lower demand within. We've heard some of the warnings already from companies. And then you layer this on top of it, right, in terms of geopolitical concerns. Did you wonder what, how it plays out in terms of their needs? They seem to catch a lot of investors off guard though, right? I mean, if they expected it, we wouldn't have seen shares fall this market. More is it just another excuse to sell. Is that just the reason that people don't want to be on these markets in the moment when you've got geopolitics rising as ugly head again, when you've got what is going to be a week of IMF World Bank Dow talk about recession, about a $4 trillion impact that you have in loss growth out to 2026 because of what there's the global central bank movement to fight inflation. And it is global. I think that's such a key theme. I think sort of the big picture of topics we've all been discussing is the global coordination or maybe the global conundrum that central banks find them in this time and are we all hiking and is this sort of a global coordinated cycle that's underway? Well, not all, right? We saw Australia back off a little bit. You know, necessarily China. You know, that's, as we start to see maybe some central bank start to do it a little bit differently. How does that provide opportunities for investors? Well, I mean, I think the coordination is kind of starting to come to an end or at least is certainly cracking. And you think about a lot of countries out there that are actually seem the negative effects of that rate hiking, particularly coming out of the US. And they have to sort of move in a different direction if they want to project their own currency and more importantly their own economy. And Tim Caroll, I'd be interested to hear how many conversations you're having, where investors and people with money to manage are talking about the Federal Reserve being forced to break something. We've talked all day about the liquidity issue that we've got in the US Treasury market at the moment that we draw all we had, Lail Bryan Art, of course, that the Federal Reserve talking to that. Is this going to be the next key conundrum as we see the bond markets reopen tomorrow? It's a really good point. We just had the Chief Investment Officer of ACM funds. He's got like 50 to 60% of his funds in cash because he finds that's the best opportunity right now. So that was very bearish for us to certainly hear, right? So it's just like people backing off at this point. Remains just in gold coins in cash. Is he? Don't let anyone know. You know, I went over to Jersey this weekend, Caroll. I missed you. Well, why didn't you stop in? No, I don't know. Yeah, I don't like to put this pop in. But you could have stopped by. I had a drink with us for a second. Next time around, give me a warning. And I'll be sure to like the door. I'm just kidding. I'm going to be fine. I'm going to be fine. All right, guys, that's a wrap. We'll be back same time, same place, our cross-platform coverage, maybe from May or I won't be here. Beyond the bell, we'll see you on Tuesday. MUSIC You're listening to Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevich on Bloomberg Radio. It's going to be a jam packed week. By the way, Remains, I'm always welcome. I'm just going to say. What about me? I don't know after that. But it's going to be jam packed. Small business, PPI, CPI, retail sales, Fed Minutes, Banker Nakes. It's a lot. Funny for us to talk about. Yeah. And certainly enough for investors to kind of digest it all and see whether or not it changes their thinking when it comes to the Fed. Let's get to world of national news and Nancy Lions in Washington, DC. Hey, Nance. Thanks, Tim. Russian President Vladimir Putin is warning of more attacks against civilian targets in Ukraine. If Ukraine continues what he calls terrorist acts on Russian territories, that's likely referenced to a recent explosion that damaged a major bridge from Russia to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1592,2022-10-10 20:12:12
13367," Crane continues what he calls terrorist acts on Russian territories. That's likely referenced to a recent explosion that damaged a major bridge from Russia to Kupai Crimea. Ukraine meanwhile is pressuring the U.S. in Europe to provide more air defense missiles after Russia's missile barrage today. Bloomberg's Amory Hordeurne with more. I spoke to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry this morning. What they are seeking for from the international community is more of these types of air defense missile systems as well as they want international community to label Russia a terrorist state. Bloomberg's Amory Hordeurne reports delivery and training on those air defense systems could take weeks. Well, today we learn former U.S. Fed share Ben Bernacki would be sharing the Nobel prize in economics with two other U.S.-based economists. It's for their research into bank failures. And as Bloomberg's Nathan Hager reports, they're among what is considered to be a list of Nobel laureates that is far from diverse. In all, 14 academics, scientists and artists are Nobel laureates this year. Only two are women. French author Annie Arno won the literature prize while Carolyn Bertosi is sharing the chemistry award this year with two men. It's a slight improvement from last year when only one woman received a Nobel. Since the prize was introduced more than a century ago, it has gone to women 61 times, including twice for Marie Curie that compares with 895 male Nobel laureates and 27 organizations.

Thank you so much. Nancy Lines with an update on World of National News. So October 10th, November, December 2nd. But two and a half months until the holidays really get our two months to lay really kick in in a big way. I'm still thinking about Thanksgiving and making my Thanksgiving plans. Halloween, people still putting up their Halloween decorations. It's October 10th, people. Halloween's the 31st. I know, so that's 21 days. Do you have your costume? I know, you know, and my daughter Aggy was little. We used to just have to go out in a big way. Ari, what are you going to be? I'm asking Ari and the controller. He's got like a three year old. Oh, yeah. What are you guys going to do? What do you guys do? Is it disgruntled producer? I don't know if you guys heard that. Sorry, I got something for us. It doesn't. Fine, I will talk about what I'm doing. Nothing. Should I tell? Yes, what is it? We're going as like Sesame Street. Oh, that was a setup, everybody. Big Bird, Arlo's Elmo. Wait, what are you? Are you Big Bird? No, I'm a cookie monster. What's your wife? She's Big Bird, and Arlo is Elmo. It's really fun. And we actually got Will Schaker from the Bloomberg technology team. He's coming. He's the count. Oh, my God. And his girlfriend is coming as well. I don't know what she's going to be doing. Are you buying or making? Mix of both. I bought, but my wife is making hers. Very nice. I'm going pictures. I want pictures. You know, fingers crossed for some good weather, right? Yes, absolutely. Can I leave early that day, Carol? You got to ask for a big voice. Okay, well, that's the big boss. Having said that, so people are out there getting ready for Halloween. Holiday Deals folks, they're coming back bringing a measure of relief for you, a shopper squeezed by inflation. We are seeing Black Friday deals. Oh, ready. Just deals in general from some of the big retailers. It's pretty remarkable, Carol. We're going to be talking to Adobe next about some trends. They got some great data about what people are buying when they're buying it. But look, Amazon is doing another prime day. So what does that tell you? They want to squeeze in an option for more discounts for, you know, second time this year. Two day early access. Say, oh, that's starting, I guess, what tomorrow? Target's weekly Black Friday deals have already started and Walmart is already touting deals on computers, toys and air friars. Inflation coming down? I don't know. So there's going to be deals.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1593,2022-10-10 20:16:29

13369," recapping the Dow, the S&P NASDAQ choppy session today for the S&P down by about 7 tenths I'm Charlie Pellet, that is a Bloomberg business flat. Christmas merchandise in stores. I like Christmas everywhere in the house. Did it seem expensive or did it seem like it was at a discount? No, they were introducing Christmas merchandise. They ordered it in 2020 and it just arrived. It was a long time to Thanksgiving merchandise. I think that was gone already. Let's look at our retail environment and the all important holiday retail shopping season. We welcome Patrick Brown, VP of growth marketing and insights at Adobe. He's on the phone from Berlin. Patrick, good to have you here with Tim and myself. What is it tell us maybe about the upcoming holiday shopping season? Great to be with you, Carolyn. Some of the holidays trends that we're seeing are continuation of what we saw last year. We're shopping and just starting earlier. We're expecting growth year-to-year, about 2.5% in the US retail market. But really some of the drivers of the growth are going to be a little bit different. We're going to be seeing people shopping earlier, some of the trends from last year. Last year, one of the big drivers, as we know, like you were mentioning, supply chain constraints made very weary customers and consumers start to shop earlier. This year, it's really going to be more of a discounting story. And those are some of the trends that we'll see carry out through the holiday season. How and why are we going to be seeing discounting right now? We're going to be seeing people shopping earlier. We're going to be seeing people shopping earlier. It's going to be a little bit different today. you know a lot of the retail is like look we heard about this three months ago too Carol right we did so so explain what's going on Patrick how does it set up this dynamic when you're exactly right and the spread between the core and the non-core price it's just it's just it's just really going to be spreading out even online and so for categories that you consider kind of core inflation like grocery we're actually not expecting much of a discount as you might imagine because it's a similar trend online as shoppers are buying more and more of their kind of their basket of goods their grocery basket of goods online as well and they'll still be paying a higher price however as supply chain constraints have eased for some of the other products like computers and electronics we're expecting some really significant discounting because retailers are looking to capture some of the some of the strengths that is in the market and and another thing one of the big drivers so last year as consumers were wary of supply chain this year again it's really driven by by discounting and things like the prime early access sales that are starting this week are going to pull sales into mid-October starting this week frankly that will then carry through to the through to the entire holiday season and the last time there was a prime day in October we saw 40% year over year growth it would have been in 2020 and so we're really watching closely how much sales get pulled up starting this week so I don't know if you can I know you guys go through a lot of data and track a lot of stuff Patrick but are we going to see so the the number dollar amount up year over year ultimately when all of a sudden done yeah you're right so we we do we track trillions of actual transactions across the Adobe analytics platforms and we are going to be up year over year it's going to be up about 3% to 1.5% year over year but that is looking at a holiday season that really starts November through to December end of December and one of the things that we're exploring is you start to define what the holiday season is if we're continuing to look at holiday season start to pull back in October we have to kind of expand our aperture a little bit and look a little broader but even in the November to December timeframe we're expecting an increase year",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1595,2022-10-10 20:25:03
13370," how it is you can start to pull back in October. We have to kind of expand our efforts or a little bit and look a little broader, but even in the November to December timeframe, we're expecting an increase year over here. And I get just a quick follow. And is it a case of the number up because there's more individual items being sold or is it because things that are being bought are just more expensive? I guess I'm trying to figure out what it means. Yeah, it's the real nominal question. I think is the one that we're all kind of keeping now, you know, we're expecting what we're going into the holiday season with some of the prices, of course, elevated as we're seeing everywhere. We are expecting deeper discounts to bring that down. So it shouldn't just be a, you know, a revenue story. It should also be a unit volume story. For example, in the computer space, last year we saw discounts of around 10%, which is really nothing when we're used for something like 20% over the holiday season. This year, we're projecting upwards of 30% discounting for computers, electronics. We're expecting a change from 8% last year. It's a nearly 27%. So we're already seeing that in some of the raw data that we're looking at as we see skew purchasing and prices come down. So it seems like in certain segments, there will be more kind of unit volume that then supports some of the top line numbers. Interesting to hear this from you, Patrick, and think back to what a month ago in Apple unveiled its new iPhone and said it wasn't raising the price for that base model. That's an entirely different discussion. We only have a minute left, Patrick, and I'm wondering about the strength of the consumer. And what you see in terms of data from Adobe right now that tell you how strong the consumer is. We've seen the continued march to online sales for consumers. I think some of the trends from COVID, where we got really comfortable buying more categories online. We see those continuing, I mentioned grocery before, that continues to make up a larger percentage of our online purchasing overall. You know, the thing we're really watching is how the discounting is gonna allow consumers to get more bang for their buck online, particularly versus in online, like an offline signal. So we think it may go back to the days when you can find a better data online, and that's really what we're watching. And I think that should create some more bullish consumers in the online spec. Patrick, really quickly, 15 seconds by now, pay later. Are people using more credit or no? You know, that's kind of plateaued, frankly. And so we've seen people using it for a lot of years, accelerating, but that has started to slow down a little bit. All right, gonna leave it there. Patrick, thank you so much, Patrick Brown, VP of Growth Marketing and Insights over at Adobe. You are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week.

13372," I didn't get too too much, although I think you touched on it. What happened with some of the US auto names? Yeah, we saw them move lower today as a result of some concerning economic conditions and what ends up happening when it comes to the auto industry. And I even seen one analyst noted glut of inventory. Big story. Big story. And so it might play out in the trade today. So we'll have more in just a moment. Yeah, but first up, let's go to a Charlie pellet because we got a lot of action happening in the after all. Indeed, the Dow, the S&P Nezdaq all declined today as for those automakers you guys are talking about. Rivian case in point after that. Recall down 7.3% for today. Tumbled 6.9% and GM lower today by 4%. The S&P's lower across the board, extending losses for a fourth consecutive session, investors are weighing concerns about the Fed's monetary tightening trajectory and its impact on corporate earnings. The S&P felt 27 points down by about 7.10% of 1% the Dow had been swinging between gains and losses for much of the afternoon down 93, ending with a loss of 3.10% as stacked down 110 down by 1%. Recall down 27 dollars the ounce to 1667 down 1.6% and West Texas, in media crude down 2.1% $90.70 of our loss. So four days of losses for the S&P 500 index, what though about the overall trend for the market, Jordan Khan is chief investment officer at ACM funds. He was our guest right here on Bloomberg Business Week. So for us, you know, we just need to see a change in trend. We need to get the market start to break back above those new advantages and for some of them to actually bottom out and start sloping upward again. And that's kind of how we define the trend, the overall trend of the market and right now, the market is still just stuck in the downtrend. And speaking of a downtrend shares of semiconductor companies move lower today with the industry selling off globally after fresh American curbs on China's access to US technology. Today we saw the socks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index lower today by 3.5% among specific chip names AMD down 1.1% Intel down 2% Nvidia lower today by 3.4%. Yuri Milner, Silicon Valley's wealthiest Russian, said today he had renounced his Russian citizenship. He completed the process back in August. Time Charlie Palette and that is a Bloomberg Business Flash. Hey, thank you so much for that update Charlie Palette. Really do appreciate it. Bloomberg Business Week is brought to you by SEI. Imagine your asset management firms operational infrastructure as a competitive advantage. Let SEI show you how at scic.com slash IMS. All right, you're listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week. You heard Charlie talk about shares of automakers. We're talking about Ford and GM taking a beating today as outlook for the industry dark and further with at least two Wall Street analysts predicting earnings will fall steeply next year. So let's get into it. Let's find out the reality, the dynamics and strategy of these names. David Welch is back with us. Yeah, David is Detroit Bureau chief for Bloomberg News. He joins us on the phone from Detroit. David, it's pretty interesting to see such a quick change in commentary when it comes to what's going on with the auto sector. Considering that for many people their experience with automobiles is having to wait in line and pay a large fee in order to actually get their hands on one over the last two years. What turned? Well, you know, we did still the case. It's just not quite as dire as it was say five or six months ago. When I talked to dealers and this was just last week we did a story on softening prices in the used car market, which by the way is usually a predecessor of what happens in the new car market and get to that in a second. But dealers are telling me that they still have pen up to man. They have still people coming in ordering vehicles, taking delivery off the truck pretty much. So there's no quite of cars yet. What the analysts are pointing out though is that as the economy slows as interest rates rise, people will start to pull back. You're already seeing in the used market. Why is that important? People with lower income shop to use market typically and then it sort of moves its way up the scale. And other people will back off. And they'll just put off a purchase career.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1598,2022-10-10 20:37:51
13373, shop to use market typically and then it's a move to play up the scale and you know other people will back off and they'll just put off a purchase per year to because cars are pretty well built these days and you can do that then you'll start to see arise inventory with the two analysts who really have dampened for gm shares today they see that happening over the course of next year i don't think it's gonna happen a second half of this year even first quarter of next year i think there's still a lot of demand out there because people been waiting for cars prices are still at record levels they were still rising as of this month for new vehicles uh... so it's gonna take a while for some of that heat to come out of the market but you absolutely could see it happening next year and then with only inflation you have in the inputs for cars still and and other commodities chips are still an issue uh... you could see the car companies really fighting a battle where demand in pricing falls and they still have to deal with higher inflation themselves so if we can do poor what pull ourselves out and and bigger picture david is this a case of the automakers getting back to pre-pandemic levels i mean i always feel like there's some perspective right because they just took off certainly the shares did in a big way as everybody wanted cars to kind of get places during the pandemic right because that's what they could do but so are we talking about getting back to pre-pandemic levels are something worse at least according to the analysts but i don't think we will get back to pre-pandemic levels of sales anytime soon one reason is just production chips semiconductors are still a problem most of the forecast out there talking about somewhere between thirteen and fourteen million vehicles but for a total this year and we're used to being around seventeen million we're not going to get enough chips next year to build seventeen million even if the demand was there i think there's probably enough demand next year for say fifteen sixteen million vehicles because and and and maybe more depending on how much the economy cools off with rising interest rates but i don't think you'll get the production i think that difference in profits is going to be pricing average new car right now selling for more than forty eight thousand which is almost four thousand more than it did before the semiconductor shortage i don't think that sort of uh... pricing inflation's gonna last car companies are going to have to get back to discounting rebates and that sort of thing to keep moving vehicles uh... just at this sort of what what's called reduced level that they can sell because it's all they can build you know that they're they're gonna be in a situation where they can they can build more vehicles but they can't build you know it's called pre-COVID levels pre-owned-owned-levels of vehicles but they still can't get the you know the the amazing pricing that they've got in earlier this year that pricing has really kept profits afloat uh... actually kept them pretty high even though they were selling far fewer vehicles than they're used to david just thirty seconds left what about when it comes to evie's in some of the biggest players that we have to reveal recall news today test that it's a terrible week last week what can you tell us there when it comes to supply and demand uh... look at it that for the growth is evie's are expensive and uh... what's put this way in in even in a bad economy the rich are always with us so i think we're gonna continue to see growth in order for vehicle sales the rich are always with us to write it is rich as they were uh... just gonna say uh... david thank you david well-chees to work to try to be a chief uh... here at bloomberg news uh... joining us on the phone from Detroit is a good story great story check it out and i'll also check out all the autos coverage you can do that on the blipper terminal and of course at bloomberg dot com alright back to world of national news we go back to our ninety nine one news remain Washington dc and back to nancy lions high-dance hey carol president by the is

linking russia with crime here former u.s. defense secretary mark as per tells bloomberg it was more than a strategic slap in the face to masco it was a personal project of lamar putin he opened the bridge in twenty eighteen personally drove a truck across it so it's not just that uh... strategic significance but it's a real punch in a gut the Vladimir putin mark as per says we need to provide you crane with anti-aircraft systems and quickly in order to protect their cities and infrastructure some of the nation's airports have been dealing with cyber attacks today originating from within

That's according to those briefed on the matter, airports in New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta, were among those targeted. The Chinese Communist Party plans to re-elect Xi Jinping to a third, five-year term in a meeting that begins this weekend. Meeting comes as President Biden imposed new export restrictions to inhibit China's ability to make advanced semiconductors. And the cutler of the Asian Society commented in a Bloomberg interview. We're going to see coming out of the party congress, a doubling down on the need for self-reliance by China to develop its own indigenous technology sector. But I don't expect major reforms or the lifting of its zero-covet policy, which could help turn around its economy. She is also relying more on state-owned industries and downplaying private enterprise, but the cutler said also its economic cost. In Washington, Earth, Japan, Bloomberg, Radio.

You are listening to Bloomberg Business Week, House, or Long with Tim Stenevek. And I wondered, this is going to be a pretty cool thing. You're sleeping, you're going to have a night back at your business. I don't know. Maybe you're getting ready for class the next day. Maybe you're getting ready for class the next day. To teach her. To get a phone call or do you get a text? I wonder how it plays out. I love changing. I love bell fairies come down and like bestow on you a president. You know, I kind of think like you know if you're in the running for it. I remember last year, two years ago, it's a dean at Stanford, who called the professor who wanted it. And I think we were talking to him last year. Are you right? Yeah. We did talk to him last year, right? We were at Stanford, right? Yeah, exactly. I think that's one. We digress, we digress. So anyway, former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Pernanke, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics today for his research on financial crises, urged policymakers to watch for any worsening of financial conditions around the world as pressures from war and currency fluctuation squeeze economies, something we talk about day in and day out. But it wasn't just him who won it. We also saw Philip Diebig and Douglas Diamond win it in their going to split three ways, the $885,000 award, that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced in stock of it. It's 10 million crooner. And I guess depending on the exchange rate, Carol. Okay. Just saying. Yeah. I don't know if you follow the Forex market lately. Yeah. Well, cross assets and moving into it. Yeah, I know. It hasn't been pretty. It's a $1. Yes, a $1. Exactly. No, it's interesting. And this story that we've got on the Bloomberg also says just two women were among this year's 14 Nobel Prize winners underscoring how the world's most prestigious science awards lacks diversity. Yeah, this is really interesting. So, well, I'm going to, before we get to that, I want to talk, yeah, before we get to that, I just want to talk a little bit about what they won for. Oh, burner. Yeah. Canteen team. Yeah, the prize committee here took an unusual step of adding an actual practitioner of economic policy to their pantheon. By contrast, many prior winners have stayed firmly rooted when it comes to academia. So that's notable about this year. Yeah.

13376," Dawson and Bill Clinton, founding director of the CBO. We're talking about the Congressional Budget Office, vice chair of the Fed, and so much more. And Tim, she started writing a book that was then finished by her son and daughter-in-law. Yeah, she sadly passed away back in 2019, but her son and daughter-in-law ended up finishing the book. We're talking about Sherri Rivlin and Alan Rivlin. Alan joins us right now. He's CEO of Zen Political Research, also the co-author of Divided We Fall. Why can Census Matters by Alice Rivlin? He joins us on the phone from Washington, DC. Alan, good to have you with us. How are you? It's great to be with you, Tim. Well, before I get to the content of the book, can you just talk process here? Because it's not every day that you speak to somebody. He ended up essentially picking up the mantle and finishing a book after his mother passes away. So take us into how you did it in the book writing process that you did with your mother and your wife. Well, Alice was just very concerned about the state of the economy, but especially the state of politics when she passed away in 2019. And everyone who knows her knows how focused she was on sounding a warning that she put in the book. But she ran out of time. And so Sherri and I finished the book for her. It took us three years. And the world kept changing while we were writing it, but it kept changing in ways that are bad for America, bad for the world, but made the topics we were writing on much more relevant. And that's what's kind of fascinating, right? I mean, this book is so timely considering the division that we've seen in the country and how it was really written initially before the January 6th insurrection and siege on the US Capitol. So tell us about how that evolution of those three years, as you said, the world kept changing, how that impacted what you wanted to include in the book while also staying true to your mom. Exactly. So we were also writing it with an editor, but also Brookings Institution scholars telling us we needed to keep the book relevant, but we didn't want to change Alice's book. So we put a forward and an afterward to sort of walk people into our process and how the world was changing and how it was making the book more relevant. But from chapter one to chapter 11, there's nothing in there that happened after 2019. We save all that for the forward and afterward. Hey, I'm wondering, Alan, if you think that Alice would be optimistic or pessimistic today? Both. She'd be worried. She'd be optimistic. She'd be focused on where we can go from here, but there are two big things that are going on right now. One is the debt and deficit issue. The markets down again today and everybody's focused on monetary policy, but our fiscal policy and monetary policy are out of whack. And I think we've given up on fiscal policy, by which I mean the size of the deficit and the mounting debt. So we don't even talk about it anymore. We look to the Fed to tighten things and get control of inflation. As she would want to be focusing on the deficits, she'd be pretty concerned because our politics is broken. She was on the deficit reduction commissions, really both of them, the Rivalen Domenici. That's what we call it in our family. Other people call it the Domenici Rivalen. And then also the Simpson Bowl. And the experts knew how to fix our deficit and debt in a balanced way that would spread the pain, so there wouldn't be too much pain. But the politicians couldn't get there. And they're no closer now. And if you look at the way things maybe headed in the next election, we maybe headed for divided government and a rerun of the 2010 through 2016 world. Well, it's fascinating. I think about early on in my coverage of business news and the financial markets, we talked about the debt nonstop. And the concerns of it ballooning out of control and we're way above the level. Never talk about that. We don't really anymore. And so it's really interesting. Shouldn't say never. But it's not something that you hear dominate the way it used to.

I'm Emily Cherkins, Francisco and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up in the next hour. The chips are down. The shares of semiconductor companies plunging to start the week after new U.S. curves on China's access to American technology. Where is the industry's downturn headed? We will discuss. Plus, it's not just chip stocks at risk, both the IMF and the World Bank are warning of a potential global recession. This as tech earnings kick off next week, we're going to preview what to expect. And the markets are spoken about the Twitter deal as well. Investors seem to see about a 60% chance that Elon Musk's deal closes by October 28th. What will become of the social media platform once that happens? We will explore that this hour. All that in a moment.

Bloomberg's Taylor Riggs here for a breakdown. Taylor, walk us through the day. Yeah, Emily, we'll just start sort of a broad picture here. You can see that really every sort of indices was under pressure. The S&P off about one, seven tens of 1%, eight tens of 1% there. But of course, big techs, certainly the big under performer, the second worst performer within the S&P 500 after energy. So that narrative of tech under pressure, that continued today.

13379," within the S&P 500 after energy. So that narrative of tech under pressure, that continued today, the Sox Index, which I know that you mentioned some of the big chip makers. And I know that you'll do a lot more on that show, the clear under performers. As you also mentioned, it has now been four straight days of a big tech, the NASDAQ 100. Now off about 5.7% four straight days in a row. Now I wish I could blame the bond market, but that was closed today. So even though the trend has been yields higher, which does impact big tech the most, today we got to reprieve a little bit from that narrative. Let's just sort of recap and take a look at this terminal chart. When I think about sort of the Sox Index and Emily, I won't sort of give too many details here, but when we think about the traditional Dow theory, the gauge of the economy, we have Dow relative to the S&P 500. But now it's actually the Sox, those chip makers, relative to the S&P 500. And that underperformance, when we think about the new economy, has been sort of the big problem. As you can see there with those chip makers, and really the new sort of bite economy under pressure, that'll sort of give you some good fodder for the rest of the show. All right, Taylor, thanks for walking us through all that. We will see what tomorrow brings. Appreciate you stopping by. I want to stick to the chip story now, chip stocks down their lowest since 2020. Joining us now, Wujin Ho, Bloomberg Intelligence, Senior Alice for Hardware and Networking. So at this point, Wujin Ho, ahead of, what could be a potentially difficult earnings season, we've already had these warnings from AMD and from Samsung, where is this going? Sure, thanks, Emily. So I think the AMD, as well as the Samsung warnings, is a precursor to what we may potentially see for the upcoming earnings season. I think the risk here is, it's not on the consumer side. I think the consumer concerns on the PC side has already been factored in. I think the bigger risk going through into our next season is this going to affect the enterprise side on the chip side? We haven't seen that yet, and but if we look at the AMD data center numbers, they weren't as strong as people as hope. There were more in line than anything else. And the concern is that it's going to affect more chip makers on the data center and cloud side. So is the chip downturn far from over? I mean, is it just starting? It potentially could be, right? If we start thinking about enterprise spending going forward, if there is a downturn going to the 2022 and 2023, then there is that risk of downward earnings or offusions to reflect the weakness on the enterprise side of the ledger, right? I still don't have a good crystal ball on where the PC sector is going to bottom out. And I think we're going to have to start seeing where the enterprise side is going to flesh out as well. Now, of course, these new round of American curves on China's access to US technology, how could that potentially make a bad situation worse? And how does that play out over the longer term? Sure. I don't think it's going to be a near term impact if anything, it's going to be a longer term impact. The ban or the curves on the AI side isn't anything new. This is something that AMD, as well as Nvidia hinted at at one of their AK filings back in September. And this makes it more official than anything else. And I believe AMD, as well as Nvidia, said the impact will be minimal because they could still sell lesser powered AI chips to China. Now, now that being said, I do think that the US does want to send in broader curves to slow down China's development of not only the use of AI chips, but also the manufacturer of AI chips. There were some developments by by Smith introducing seven nanometer chips. I think that put a scare into the US and they want to slow down anything that China can do to develop some of these higher powered chips going forward. So it doesn't sound like you think we're heading towards a total ban, but, you know, is that a possibility? Well, let's let's use, let's use Huawei as an example of as well as ETE. There is an entity list that they're on. And they're on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1605,2022-10-10 21:08:17
13380," Let's use Huawei as an example as well as ETE. There is an entity list that they're on. And at the end of the day, Huawei's smartphone business essentially has pretty much died. If there is an entity list that the US has started to beef up. And we might start seeing some of these lesser known Chinese memory companies as well as chip manufacturing companies fall into that entity. If that's going to be the case, then then there might be a dent into the China's chip manufacturing initiatives going forward. So I mean, we'll case we still have to see where this will go, but that still may happen. All right. Well, a lot of red for chips to start the week. Wu Jun Ho, Bloomberg Intelligence, senior analysts. Thank you so much for stopping by now. Speaking of China, we're following the COVID situation there as well. Tally's rising in fears of a potential lockdown. We're turning once again. The country reported 1,887 cases for Sunday. The highest since August 20th, and Shanghai posted the most new local infections in almost three months, officials saying anyone traveling to Shanghai will need a negative COVID result within 24 hours of arriving in the city and will have to do three tests in three days. Coming up a bit more than a coin tossed, Cowan analysts pricing in a 60% chance that Elon Musk's deal with Twitter gets done by the deadline. We're going to dig into the odds. Next, this is Bloomberg. The glimpses we've had of Elon Musk's vision for Twitter include potentially becoming part of what he calls X, the Everything app, which brings to mind the Chinese app WeChat. Quick takes out, Swab. Talk to us about the obstacles Twitter will face if it tries to become more like WeChat. Take a listen. Elon Musk's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1606,2022-10-10 21:12:27
13381," Takes out, Webb. Talk to us about the obstacles Twitter will face if it tries to become. More like WeChat. Take a listen. Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to buy Twitter is back on. And it comes with an interesting wrinkle turning the social media company into a so-called super app. Now, this is what the Chinese company WeChat has really pioneered. It's a portal in China for everything from dating apps to paying your bills, ordering food and getting taxis. But it hasn't really succeeded in Europe and the US. And there are often three obstacles. Firstly, you need to have a payment layer, something that connects all of the apps together and makes it easy to pay in one quick action. Secondly, you need to have a lot of developers. Twitter has about 200 million users, but there are about 1.8 billion active users of Apple devices and 3 billion active users of Android devices. If you're a developer or a company looking to build a product, it's pretty clear which of those three services you're likely to prioritize. And finally, there is the regulatory consideration. If you are a company that leverages its strength in one service to build strength in a different one, that is not something that regulators, particularly in Europe, look too kindly upon. But it also comes with a slight problem. Either you are not big enough for developers to have the scale that they want to build apps and services for your product, or if you do have the scale, you're going to attract that regulatory attention. Perhaps Elon is the person who can make this happen, but it does come with a lot of obstacles. Quick ticks Alex Web there, sticking with Twitter, merger arbitrage strategist at Cowan State, the market is pricing in. Just a bit more than the odds of a coin touch that Elon Musk's deal with Twitter will close by the court issued deadline of October 28th here to tell us more about the latest Bloomberg's Kurt Wagner, who has of course been covering this whole saga for us. We're going to get to the wechat thing in a moment, Kurt. But what do you make of this whole 60% chance thing, especially given nothing? I was trying to finish or thing to this point. Yeah, I was trying to think it's something clever about fool me once, you know, whatever. But to me, it feels higher than 60% simply because, you know, both sides are showing up. They want the same deal, right? They want the same price at least. That's what they say. And now a judge has said, OK, you have told the 28th to do this and a lot of the stuff, getting debt financing in order, for example, getting shareholder approval. That's all done, right? So they say they want the same deal. They say that all the stuff that they need to do to get that done is essentially done. So I feel like it's got to be higher than 60% Emily. But, you know, what do I know? I feel like we've been talking about this for six months and it keeps changing. So what? Right. What do any of us know? Well, Elon Musk knows, or at least he has said he wants to make Twitter part of this everything app vision. What does that mean to you? How do you interpret that? Does it sound to you like WeChat? Sounds a lot like WeChat. And it's not necessarily a bad idea because WeChat is incredibly popular in China. And we've seen other companies, mostly Facebook, try to do this as well, right? Where I think it's an issue is that as Alex said in kind of the intro you showed, Twitter just doesn't have the scale that's needed for something like this, right? And most of what makes WeChat so valuable, I think, is that it's also the place where people do all of their communication, right? It's not just where you get your Uber or your order, your food delivery. It's where you're talking with mom and dad and grandma and your boss and your cousins and like Twitter is not that place, right? It is not a place that people are hanging out. And so for me, the idea of suddenly turning into a place where everyone is hanging out and suddenly doing their shopping, it just doesn't really make sense. Again, I like the idea and concept because it's see it clearly works in China. I just don't think that this is going to happen for Twitter. Now, it is ambitious and if anyone can do it, right? You would say, all right, well, maybe Elon Musk is that person, but Mark Zuckerberg tried to meta a few times and it's not happening there either. So speaking of scale, how are you thinking about potential staffing changes once Musk presumably takes over the company? Is there going to be a mass exodus? Is there going to be an influx of Elon Musk's fans who want to work for him? Clearly, the size that the company is can't necessarily handle, like you said, the scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1607,2022-10-10 21:16:54
13382," You know, Elon Musk's fans who want to work for him, you know, clearly the size of the company is can't necessarily handle, like you said, the scale of a social media platform, the size of WeChat. Well, I can tell you what I know, and then I can speculate a little bit. What I know is that a lot of people inside Twitter are currently worried for their jobs, right? They expect Elon to come in and do laughs. They expect them to essentially kind of clean the executive ranks, you know, certainly see EO Prog, Agarwal, probably the head lawyer, Vigit Gotti. And you know, this is something that happens a lot of times during the acquisition, but I think especially now, because Elon has basically said he doesn't have confidence or faith in those leaders, right? So this is what people are bracing for. Now, what he does next is going to be a good question. Is he going to trim the company down and simply keep it sort of the engineers, bare bones, folks who are going to build product? Or if he wants to do this kind of super apt thing, he's talking about he's going to need partnerships people. He's going to need probably content people, like moderation people, right? Which is something that he is kind of shyed away from. And so that's where I think things get a little tricky is, you know, the financial vision for the company seems to be let's cut everything back and maybe, you know, get healthy, as he likes to say. But the vision is much more ambitious than that. And I'm not sure that necessarily works with that small of a staff. All right. Lots continue to follow, Kurt. I know you'll be all over it. Thank you for the updates. I want to get a quick check on another story that we're following, which is several airport websites in the U.S. were knocked off line by a pro-reshot activist group. Chicago's O'Hare and LAX among the websites hacked. The group called KillNet has been linked to a series of cyber attacks against Western targets, including disruptions to some state government websites last week. Coming up, we're going to talk about the state of the cosmetics industry as consumers have moved online. Our exclusive interview with the team from Curology. Coming up next, this is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1608,2022-10-10 21:21:08
13383," The Cosmetics Company that provides prescription skin care customized to patient skin has grown at lightning speed over the last few years with revenue for 2022 projected at over $200 million. The company is now profitable and announcing changes to its C-suite to prepare for the next phase. Dr. David Lorscher, co-founder of Curology, stepped down as CEO to pass the torch to Heather Wallace, who was most recently president at Revlon. They're both joining me now for more on the transition. So David, I want to start with you. Give us some background on the transition here at Who Pop the Question and How. Thank you, Emily. That would be me who popped the question. And the reason is that the skills you need to successfully found at the company are just very different than the skills you need to take an established company like Curology and grow it to its full potential. And so, you know, right now, the company is in this incredible position for the future, because like you said, we became profitable and we really have the ability to invest. And so, Michael is just to find someone to help take us to that next level. And I just couldn't be more excited to be able to have found Heather here. Heather, given what you learned recently at Revlon, what's your vision for the company and what you know about what's going on in the beauty world, especially given that we are moving into potentially a pretty pronounced downturn. So I mean, a couple things. One is I'm so sorry, excited to be joining Curology and Curology is actually doing what many BB companies are talking about, which is personalization. So it's truly personal, personalized skincare. We are connecting people with dermatology providers that create custom formulas. And we can service those consumers and really help them have better skin outcomes. And so people, your face is the way that you face the world. And so how you look and how your face looks really has a big impact on your confidence, on how you feel, and truly a big impact in your life. So I'm excited about that with Curology. Now in terms of what's happening with the economy, I think we're all are concerned about that. This is an incredibly resilient category. I do expect us to be able to do very well during this time period. I 100% agree that good skincare is vital. But how much do you think people are really going to be spending on themselves right now when they're spending more on everything from gas to groceries? I mean, isn't that the first thing to go? You? It's actually not. There are many things that go before skincare. So I've actually seen data over time on what happens during challenging economic times. And skincare is one of the most resilient categories. The end of the day, as you say, you know, you're going to work, you're in front of friends and family, you're putting your best face forward. And it is very important. And so I do expect consumers to still spend in this area. David, the cult of the founder is so strong and especially in Silicon Valley. And I'm wondering if you've been pretty straightforward about why you're doing this. And now do you think too many founders stay too long and that more founders should leave potentially sooner? Every company is different, but I do believe that, you know, the decision to pass the baton, as you say, to someone like Heather should actually be made a lot more commonly because ultimately, what we care about is getting our business to that next level. And the same person to successfully found a company isn't necessarily the right person to get you to that next level. So I do think there's a lot of merit in that. Heather, I know that Revlon recently filed for bankruptcy. They're talking about supply chain issues. Curious if you're expecting to deal with some of those similar issues at curology, especially as it pertains to the supply chain and what you learned there that you can potentially apply here and head off some of these challenges. Yeah, so I think when it comes to curology, our supply chain is really focused in the US. And so it's much more simple. We are providing products end to end, but it's a much more simple supply chain. So the other thing I know is that just keeping us focused. So keeping us focused on the right and the core of the products and being able to continue to do our personalization and our customized.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1609,2022-10-10 21:25:30
13384," Other thing I know is that just keeping us focused. So keeping us focused on the right and the core of the products and being able to continue to do our personalization and our customized formulas at scale is going to be where the focus is. So let's talk a little bit more about that. What's your hope for the next chapter of growth given the Ryzen Direct consumer skin care, the Ryzen personalization, as you say, the Ryzen subscription services, but also the fact that some people might be playing for a few different subscription services, you know, at one time. How do you, how do you see consumers balancing all of that and curology winning out? So the company was founded on the mission of access that consumers should have access to the kind of skin care solutions that the best dermatologists can provide. And so as we think about growth in the future, it's all gonna be about continued awareness and access to those providers and the more access and awareness that we can create, the more consumers we can bring in. We're the largest player in the personalized skin care space, but we are relatively small at this point compared to the $20 billion facial skin care market in the US. David, what are you hoping to see in this next chapter and how involved will you be? I will be stepping into the position of a board chairperson. And, you know, ultimately the most important thing is that curology succeeds. And so I'm gonna be helping in every way that any way that I can. But, you know, the biggest thing for me is that we have this really huge opportunity in front of us because I think if you talk to almost anybody who's used curology, they will tell you there's no way I'm going back to using what I used before. But when you take a step back and look at the market, about 95 plus percent of people are still using non personalized, less effective skin care. And so what I really do hope to see is just us being able to continue to spearhead the market shifting towards the more effective, personalized type of skin care that the best dermatologists provide. And speaking of the market, Heather, I mean, are you thinking about an IPO in terms of the next phase of growth? You know, who knows what the future will bring? I think we're gonna be focused on profitable growth and reaching more consumers with our fantastic customized solutions. And the better skin, the more better skin outcomes that will just unlock the future possibilities. All right, Heather Wallace, the new CEO of Curology and Dr. David Lorscher, co-founder of Curology Moving into the role of Chair, thank you both for joining us. All right, coming up, growing fears of a global recession. What does it mean for tech stocks and upcoming tech earnings? We will talk about that.

I want to turn back to the markets as heads of the IMF and the World Bank War and of a rising risk of global recession. This with advanced economy slowing down and faster inflation forcing the Fed to keep raising interest rates. What does it mean for tech stocks and tech earnings coming up? I want to break that all down with Michael Casper of Bluberg Intelligence. So what do you make of the macro environment? What's happening here? And what it means for tech stocks, Michael? Yeah, the macro environment is still somewhat strong for what it is in technical recession right now. Just to give you some context around the S&P earnings that large, we were looking at about a 2.5% expansion. In 3Q, it's still an expansion. And that's going to be the trough, or at least it looks like it's going to be the trough, at least according to consensus for this earnings cycle. And specifically with tech stocks, tech is looking to have about a 7.5% earnings contraction. That's only second worst to communications and financials, which are tied with a 12.1% decline. And some of the tech stocks, specifically some of the industries, look to be under pressure here, given the rising dollar and some of the supply chain concerns that linger. Now, the World Bank is saying there's a real danger of worldwide contraction. You've got Jamie Dimon saying markets are going to fall another 20%. What's your own research showing? Well, we're seeing much lighter contraction, right? So if you use our fair value model and use September's law as the price and try to back into what earnings contraction was priced by the market, you're looking at about a 5% earnings drop to a company in that. And by the way, that would be pretty much right in line with the narrowest.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1611,2022-10-10 21:34:11
13386," expansion. We're 5% interest rate. You're looking at about a 5% earnings drop to accompany that. And by the way, that would be pretty much right in line with the narrowest earnings drop that we've had across all the recessions historically back to 1960 in line with that 1980 recession, which coincidentally was a very, you know, inflationary period as well. So we've got a raft of tech earnings coming out next week. Netflix will be kicking us off. Of course, we've got, you know, all the big tech companies quickly to follow. What are you looking at and what are you expecting? I'm looking at the outlets for companies, especially the mega caps, right now the mega caps are expected to have about a 2% earnings increase on median, so the top five, tech and tech-related stocks, Tesla, I threw Tesla in there. And that would be the worst going back to 1Q2016. So I'm watching the outlets on those mega-cap stocks. Within tech, I think semi's is particularly interesting, given the chivalrous today, limiting exports to China. And that's industry's forecast for about 14% decline. So there's still lingering supply chain issues there. There's the pressure from the latest announcement from the Biden administration. And semi's looks to be under some considerable pressure here. You know, how do you think whatever we see from these earnings could set the tone for the rest of the year? I mean, given what we're seeing in chip stocks, not good so far, if we continue to get some more bad signals, I mean, you know, does that spell doom and gloom? Yeah, it wouldn't necessarily be good, especially considering if you're looking at the S&P 500 as a whole, tech and discretionary stocks are supposed to leave the way out of this kind of mild earnings recession that we're having right now. And you know, if that doesn't materialize, at least on the tech side, which is a huge driver, I mean, we're talking about 22% of the indexes in those top five stocks. If we're looking at some weakness in tech stocks, it will translate to overall to weakness in the S&P 500. But so far, I will say at least on the earnings front, companies have done a pretty good job making the best out of a bad situation with margins. All right, Michael. Well, thanks for giving us your view and good to hear someone who's a little bit more optimistic than others, Michael Caspar of Bloomberg Intelligence appreciated. Meantime, another story that we are watching shares of Rivian declined after the EV maker said it'll recall about 13,000 vehicles delivered to customers after discovering a minor structural defect with a nut that could loosen fully in, quote, rare circumstances. The company said it's recalling almost all vehicles delivered to customers, even though the issue was discovered only in seven out of an abundance of caution. And speaking of EVs, Amazon just announced it'll spend a billion euros over five years to electrify its delivery fleet in Europe. That money will be used to double the number of EVs in Europe to 10,000 vans and 1,500 electric heavy goods vehicles. So they call them Bloomberg Spencer Soaper who coverage Amazon for us is here with more. So what is Amazon hoping to accomplish Spencer with this announcement? Yes, so basically Amazon's sending a message to the market, you know, start producing more EV vehicles because Amazon can't find enough of them. And you're recent in your segment that you just had about Rivian, in particular, shows they don't like to be wholly dependent on one particular company as well. So they buy from Rivian, they buy from Mercedes, they want more people in the market producing these things and they just want more of these electric vehicles produce, you know, as a bottom line. How do electric cars fit into Amazon's plans to get to net zero by 2040? Yes, so Amazon really hasn't said precisely how it's going to do this. A very lofty goal, you know, net zero emissions by 2040, but their most visible thing has been electric vehicles. They're on the road, you see them and they're going to have to address a lot of other things in their company, like, you know, airplanes and ocean liners and those sorts of things that are still very fuel heavy. But they're, uh,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1612,2022-10-10 21:38:23
13387," company like airplanes and ocean liners and those sorts of things that are still very fuel heavy, but their electric vehicles is really the predominant piece of their push so far. So talk to us about the other parts and the other potential parts of their push. How else are they going to get to net zero? Yeah, there were some interesting things in this announcement in Europe where they even talked about making deliveries on electric bicycles and even by foot and they also talked about expanding their network in Europe, their warehouse network in Europe. And I think there's also setting a message with that as well that they want to make sure that it's particularly the delivery station. They want to make sure that it's equipped with charging stations for any type of non or low emission vehicles that they might be using. They want to make sure that the infrastructure that they have, not just the vehicles they have, but the infrastructure they have is capable of charging these things. And how is what they're doing in Europe compared? How does it compare to what they have done so far in the United States? I mean, it pretty much is the same model, you know, just a big investment in electric vehicles, but this is the biggest announcement they've made by far in Europe. So they're trying to send a message to Europe, say, listen, what we've been doing in the US, we're going to be doing the same thing, same thing in Europe and following the same playbook. All right, Spencer Soaper, I always go to have you with us. Thank you, Spencer, for those updates. Thumbs up. All right, coming up the long crypto winter. How much longer is it going to last? And what do we make of all the recent crypto CEO and other executive departures? We're going to talk about that and more with Hunter Horsley, Bitwise asset management, CEO. That's next. This is Bloomberg. Time now for our crypto reporting as global market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1613,2022-10-10 21:42:42
13388," Time now for our crypto reporting as global markets are awaiting U.S. inflation data. Thursday, I want to take a look at the global wave of monetary tightening to fight inflation and how it's spurred in your 60 percent slide in Bitcoin this year. Will Bitcoin break its $20,000 mark anytime soon? I want to ask Hunter Horusley about that. And more he's the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management. Hunter, good to have you back. So let's start on markets. What's your read as we head into the fourth quarter? And there seems to be just more and more bad news. Yeah, it's been a tumultuous year in markets broadly and certainly in crypto. I think the current recent numbers this year, the NASDAQs down over 30 percent, S&P's down and crypto's down 60 percent. Or thereabouts, it's changing every day. So the story of this year is definitely a bear market. Nevertheless, we've seen increased interest from our client base. And I think that the backdrop for many crypto investors is that there historically have been four year cycles. And while there are opportunities to make money in many moments of the crypto market, bear market moments of the moments where fortunes can be made. And so there are some that are positioning themselves in the current bear market and coming into the space now. So what do you think it'll mean for crypto ultimately? Does Bitcoin break that $20,000 mark, for example? Yeah, you know, I can't say for sure about about $20,000. And certainly it's a space with quite a bit of volatility. But the historical pattern of crypto with the data we have, you know, about 12 years of a journey, is that we get four year cycles. We get three years of goal markets with growing momentum. And then we get a bear market year. So 2014, the market down almost 60 percent, 2018, the market down north of 70 percent. And this year, obviously, the market down in 2022, around 60 percent. The expectation, if the market, you know, continues its historical trend, would be that we begin a new cycle next year. And so wherever we wind up this year, a lot of investors are thinking about how that positions them for the next cycle. You're out with a new Web 3 fund that'll give retail investors exposure to companies across Web 3, finance the metaverse, the creator economy. As we barrel into a recession, what makes you think investors are going to jump on board? Yeah. So at Bitwise, we view our role as helping investors understand and access the opportunities in crypto. And certainly there are a wide range of important things going on in the world today, outside of this space. But it's our job to stay focused on this space specifically. We've been doing it for five years. We work with over a thousand financial advisors, branches, and institutions. And what we saw with Bweb was an emerging category of opportunity around the established innovators, established companies who are positioned to benefit from the rise of Web 3, from the environment created by crypto. And so we view it as our job to recognize worthwhile opportunities and open up access to those. And so that's why we introduced the Web 3 product. And in general today, there's quite a wide aperture of different areas that investors see opportunity in the crypto markets, quite different from when we started the firm. The story was mostly just about Bitcoin. Now there have been a number of high profile crypto executive departures, CEOs, the CFO of OpenC recently left. What do you think is behind all of this? You know, I think zooming out, it's a difficult time in the economy. And crypto is not bigger than that. It's not excluded from that. And in fact, you know, crypto is more volatile in general. And so I think it's natural to expect that you would see turnover and that you would see adjustments with the firms in the space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1614,2022-10-10 21:47:03
13389," in general. And so I think it's natural to expect that you would see that you would see turnover and that you would see adjustments with the firms in the space. We've been around for five years and in that period of time alone have seen many many of the players change. I think it's a healthy part of the progression and the maturation of the space, but in thinking about what it means for the average investor who's interested in the space doesn't have a ton of time to focus on everything that's going on day to day. I think the real learning of 2022 is that it's starting to really matter who you work with or what platform you use or what app you use and not all of these things are created equal. I think in 2021 there was a sense that if you invested in something, it didn't really matter where you bought it or how you bought it, you had a shot at a great return. I think this year what's becoming more clear is that it matters who you're working with or what service you're using to invest. So I think that that is the implication of this for most investors is paying attention to who you're working with. Now I'd love for you to put your social media hat on for a moment. You used to work at Facebook and Instagram earlier in your career. I'm sure you've been following the Twitter musk saga to a certain extent. Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey, we now know from their text, you know, talked about making Twitter an open source protocol. What do you think about a decentralized vision for Twitter? And if something like that is really possible? I think it's possible. I think it's exciting and I think it's an experiment. We're going to see a play out in the next in the immediate term future. In fact, there's a project called Farcaster that's already attempting to build a Web 3 version of Twitter where you can have a similar communication experience, but you don't worry about the sort of corporate policy and the moderation policy because the information is on a blockchain and then the app just pulls information to that blockchain. So I think the game is afoot on this one. And I think zooming out, it's sort of indicative of the moment we're at in the crypto space and with Web 3, which is there are now a huge amount of developers. There's great funding. There's proven technology. And I think over the next two years, you're going to see a big wave of attempts to build consumer applications to build services that people use. And I think the Twitter scenario is front and center as one of those in Web 3. So it sounds like you see this pretty clearly. Can you explain what this actually looks like and how how do things change for the average Twitter user? What happens to Hukdo Twitter? For example, if everything is decentralized, I think some people just don't understand like what are they? What do they really mean? Here's the mental model I'd offer. In the current world, your followers, your audience is only available on Twitter. So whatever Twitter does is law. And sometimes that is a downside for certain users. The decentralized Web 3 version, I don't know exactly what it'll look like, but it'll look something more like the way you think about your email, which is if you're not happy with Gmail, you can move to AOL. If you're not happy with AOL, and you want certain features, you can move to superhuman, and so on and so forth. You can take your email address, you can take your contact book with you, and you can go somewhere else if you don't like the way that the app is being built or the policies of the app. And so that's what people are striving for here. When you hear people say a Web 3 version of something similar to the dynamic and power structure that exists with email, they want to introduce that to more parts of our life. And so I think you could use that as an analogy for how it might change certain services like Twitter. Interesting. Well, thanks for humoring us there.

Sooner rather than later, Hunter, thank you for stopping by. Coming up, charging changes, Apple's shift, it's charging port on the iPhone 2, USB-C to abide by a new European law, even as it moves forward with plans for a wireless future. I'm gonna break that all down next. This is Bloomberg. So, Apple is set to shift from the lightning charging port on the iPhone and other devices to USB-C to abide by a new European law. What does this mean for the company's wireless future? Let's bring in Mark German for more. So, let's rewind a little bit because when they changed that lightning charging port, it was a little traumatic for some people. What exactly is Apple doing now and what does it mean for iPhone users? That's right, Emily. So, for most of the 2000s, right, Apple had what was called the 30-pin iPod connector. That worked on all their main iPods and was also the connector that was on the iPhone until the iPhone 5. In 2012 with the 5, Apple moved to lightning. It's much smaller, it's reversible, it's all digital. It made sense as things were shifting more wirelessly. Right? But now, we're getting to the point where USB-C is taking over the tech industry. And now the European Union is pushing USB-C because it's interoperable between Android devices, from Samsung, from Google, as well as Apple devices. Right now, the iPhone still uses lightning. That means you can't use the same charger to charge your iPhone as you can even with your iPad Pro or your MacBook Pro or your Android device. So because of some prodding from the European Union and because it just makes sense for consumers and its ecosystem, Apple will move to USB-C next year in 2023 with the iPhone 15. They'll also move it to some of their Mac accessories. They still use lightning, some of their iPhone accessories like the Mac safe battery that use lightning, and probably most critically the AirPods, which also still use lightning. So overall, it's a very good move for consumers, I think. What does it mean, though, given that Apple really wants us ultimately to not have to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1616,2022-10-10 21:55:45
13391," still use lightning. So overall, it's a very good move for consumers, I think. What does it mean, though, given that Apple really wants us ultimately to not have to use any wires at all? Yeah, that's a good question. So 2017, about five years ago, Apple announced a device called the AirPower. What that was was a three device charging mat from the company. It was announced in 2017, was supposed to go on sale in 2018. And it would allow you to inductively charge an iPhone, AirPods, and the Apple Watch at the same time. Many technical issues I won't be labor right now. That never launched. But Apple still wants to push users towards wireless charging, the latest MacBooks. They all use MagSafe charging, right? You don't stick an actual cable into the device, but it uses somewhat of a magnetic inductive charger called MagSafe. The iPhone has MagSafe charging. The Apple Watch has MagSafe charging. The AirPods have MagSafe charging. So while the lightning connector and the iPod 30 pin connector before that, both lasted about 10, 11 years for the respective ecosystems, I think USB-C is going to be the Apple connector for the next five years. And then we'll see a much bigger push to inductive charging, MagSafe, and wireless, and tropical boot. Interoperability. All right. Boomer's Mark Gurman. I always appreciate you keeping us up to on all things Apple. Thank you so much for that. And that does it for the S edition of Bloomberg Technology.

13392," D.L. The great sci-fi art of the mid-twentieth century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. 20 years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism, private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high reward, but government is really out of the business of flying people now. It's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1618,2022-10-10 22:04:20
13393," A thousand by Jeff Bezos, using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Boking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first seat to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism, aiming for a launch in 2022, once Sir Richard himself has taken flight. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000, or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly, both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are......a whole, another level of complexity, energy, and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the VomCarmen line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you would need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there, and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved, or much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up, and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect, and this mission is changing that, and so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer, and I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave, and they are very excited to watch me go to space, because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the year of every 90 minutes before landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side, and so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in the 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, what you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by a superpower, like the United States or Russia or China, well, that's really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom Space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. There are two billion dollar project called AxStation, where we become the first free-flying private international space station. Or to use a more consumer friendly term. In the following projects, it will Minecraft Proctor YouTube or render and make space available. Through how long you can reach that, you want to��서 means sometimes more than connecting to allows the space build. And the bottom screen will cycle faster and the space will get together. And it will eventually becoming more internet digital, lots of other small brands that can directly focus on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1619,2022-10-10 22:09:16
13394," There are $2 billion project called ACS Station, where we become the first free-flying private international space station. Or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. ACS is the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low-error space has been building what they call expandable Habitat Technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now that they've been testing it, and you take it up and it's rather small, and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're going to see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry. Instead of this giant tin can, with all of that, the inflatable sort of lighter, you can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about, you know, half the less than half the weight, probably. But even if space missions become accessible to civilians, the risks of going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tourists, so I haven't been privy to their private contracts, but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tourists of all of the hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching the United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to waive. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you. If something goes wrong, it's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are gonna have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. Doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now something goes wrong. So let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sooth, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You see the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that. Because the way that we, the outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing in a court of law. And so every single slip and fall in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we, before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's all around us some free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person, it may be there two or three years without coming back to earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1620,2022-10-10 22:13:18
13395," once fanciful modes of travel. Right brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. Vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went, without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. So government's vision came out and visitors were close youngsters and won lots of attention and the world's achievements, the race, the dreams and the world momentum and about restart. I can get this that looks like a genetic If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. Or jump in your convertible and take Highway 1 up the coast. Or maybe make a pilgrimage to Yosemite. All very fine choices. And if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000-year-old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two-fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost town of Bodhi. It's an novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 up right, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's take it. I'll get it. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Spurostra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North because this is my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media.

13396," I like to be known as that, but I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Waited we had a cab, but we got here late last night. I was sure where we are. This is BLM land right on the outskirts of National Forest and it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically everything outdoors wrapped into one. Yeah. You think about California, man? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest and Public Land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. Has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has except for a toilet, but just on a smaller, simple scale. And you drive it around day to day in LA and then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver, handles great, and then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping and out. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box, stove, utensils and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And then when you get inside, there's a bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. This awning is phenomenal. If you want to pull that over. That's cool. Let me just pop that up. So home on wheels. Yeah. So nice, man. Even with his Nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Do the internet and smartphones have to ruin everything? When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bustin' out a map and like look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just get to know people of the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Roadtrip apps, camping apps, they proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's gonna blow up. It's gonna get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not gonna stop it. We're not gonna stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're poopin' out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace. As a thank you for this quick guide to pooping etiquette. We made yawn, hair, and and lemmy some tacos.

13397," we The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through your serenity. The smoke was not quite as effective as we had hoped. Fast forward four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smokey majesty of your serenity for the smokey... Look at it. Strip malls of the central valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous central valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg so we're right in the central valley of California. It's kind of considered the red basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles and the farmers here produce about one-fourth of the food that Americans eat. We've seen a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got to what's essentially like a startup I guess. Yeah definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw and he started the business back in 1982. He started with his dad was commercial spring of trees and vineyards. Back to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it really. He was forced into innovating and he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and finally got to the point where he said you know what I either got to get out of this business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1623,2022-10-10 22:29:10
13398," This idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer and it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not crops need to be sprayed and this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this like labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor I think like eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying in the orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is kind of like the, this is a test orchard where you guys put it through the paces and work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, prior to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big airflow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers and people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas or where they go? So right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers and the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much did they cost each? And so our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines they just they just drive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine this is our first machine we call it orchard gas. Mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit in the future. We're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. Okay. Vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller and then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating.

I'm Aki Ito, and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak, and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use, and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup company. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. Its US office is here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. Come on in. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is L.A.Q. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? L.A.Q. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? That's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Like, or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. I can tell her I'm depressed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1625,2022-10-10 22:37:32
13400," Daily basis we see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her or that they miss her. Literally I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Q is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Q tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior and how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Q from the way Ellie Q moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Q tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now see this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say no I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Yeah. Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer but now this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. Ellie Q. Yes. Schedule doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly I said are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said I don't know let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the US. We as immigrants we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle it gave her so much more because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard no matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1626,2022-10-10 22:41:47
13401," No matter what the challenges are. School didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job at Ugradskoll was at X, the secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming up all kinds of wacky, far-fling ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where I'll be like a circle of men with their like zip-up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand and I'll come in with lipstick and nobody wants a top speed. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things, that make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? No, it's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97. And he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine, how are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? You always tell me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now the Q, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older. And if current trends continue, more and more are going to be like Joseph and Betty, living alone. LEQ, stop. Today, both of them are doing okay. But some of Danielle's other participants have been struggling. It's a kind of hard to leave them at the end of the day. It is. Some of our testers are pretty advanced in the stages of depression through loneliness and isolation. And at times, I know that LEQ is cheering them up in their day. But I know that it's only a part of the way. No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companions every human care.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1627,2022-10-10 22:46:09
13402," No source of artificial intelligence robots will ever be able to replace humans and human companionship with human care. The key to Danielle's work is to embrace that very limitation of machines. Robots should help humans do what they love, help humans interact with more humans, help humans in general. Not pull humans away from humans, not take humans jobs, leave humans about purpose. Whether it's in our workplaces or in our homes, robots are soon going to be everywhere. And it's up to Danielle to make sure this robot-filled future leaves us just a little better off. So don't be afraid. And if you are afraid, come and join us. Because I promise it's a friendly place. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what we call the most. And if you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what we call the most. If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically-carated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, with baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content. And that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. Here I am, here I am, proud to be a dude. But often it involves toys. And for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think it was surprised, unquestionably, the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in touring this street. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids' toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spinmaster. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves, like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1628,2022-10-10 22:50:19
13403," I was like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. The hit of the day when you're ready to play, everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes. Greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go fighting man. Forget to go on the land of the TNT air. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of Hitchhows? You think of things like Masters of the Universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained, but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999, he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years, and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. And to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toy started to become designed for a 30-second commercial. That closed its a mild amount of toolbox. Open its a micro machine, USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the rear working driver, highway passenger rap and garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30-second commercial, cost-reduced it out of the product and just stick with what you could say. And features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds, and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens. That became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. It's the fire from that man. See you, Batman. Batman's turbo powered, that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000, with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids and mass numbers every day of the week. And so the toy industry has continued to grow. The toy industry, for the most part, was a pretty solid business. Just growing a couple of percent a year here and there. There'd be big years here and there when there was maybe a hit movie. Like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys RS, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005. And this was like, you know, the very early web 2.0, this beginning of sort of like what with the time was going to be a new generation content. Like web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, Lazy Sunday, if you remember that SNL short. That's the chronic one, Killsonania! Oh, Charlie, don't cut me a bit. You remember those earliest viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1629,2022-10-10 22:54:58
13404," Earl Hitz. YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube, and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of PocketWatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world, and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The Trident is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube, is by a creator and star named Ijustine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone, and it came in a box. And this ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing, and tech was actually really big. And those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. And you saw them expand from tech products to beauty products, and then around 2012 and 2013, which turned this explosion into toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannels, and a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy, and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators, we signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners, and it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre, and this whole new format, and that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube that was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data, and we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up, we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star, and they would open toys, and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed in just about every toy, you know, and people were just really excited. You opened the toy, and you see a toy pop out, and kids just got excited, and see the piece by piece. He's in a bathroom, we're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long, they were boring, they were just shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience, and they're, they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it, and it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing, and just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that, I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL Surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is, collectible. So within each LOL Surprise, you'd get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you could collect. And then the surprise factor, you don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. Back then, you know, in 2016, they were small players in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian, he's the CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's scene. And I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1630,2022-10-10 22:59:17
13405," He's a CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said like what? And they said for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? So I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera? And everybody would go and watch it. So I typed toy unboxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate and that's the first LOL surprise. All right. Oh yes, we've got a goal ball. LOL changed the way you open with toys. And everybody saw that. And the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package you take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marvel. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't have to figure out when Marvel are Star Wars is. And LOL eclips them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards, where you open packs in hopes of getting a charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products and the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala Loopsie dolls. They tried to flex their muscle. And they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict, we are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network. And not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death nap. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before, because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom, both in L.A. federal court and on appeal in the ninth circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So that by itself forces us to go and say, OK, they held with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest, as they say, is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1631,2022-10-10 23:03:36
13406," That's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences like Cookie Swirl See. Good morning, CHOPSiti-Cookie. We are going to be standing the morning with this LOL surprise baby fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them, you know, support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LML Surprise and you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ads spend and then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated you have to really take a deep dive into each platform and my promoting on Twitter, my promoting on Instagram, my promoting on TikTok. What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017 big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys and if they were lucky that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. In one of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content and that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos and they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation and that you know blurs the lines for kids is they're sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's world would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started you know charging for their services as they started building a following. Now because it is such a big business the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's world to ensure that we can",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1632,2022-10-10 23:07:48
13407," package with Ryan's world to ensure that we could get really quick big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. And the content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created this, like, a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way, when you've had toys like GI Joe turn into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows created around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform YouTube kids, and each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either made for kids or not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New John Risen formats there that they didn't prior, and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy on boxing. That's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way, which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine-year-olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers, but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys, a cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy, but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan, and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant global brands, and that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. Airbnb is huge today. On any given night, you could have as many as two million people staying in an Airbnb all around the world. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year, and there's tyranny in numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident, but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1633,2022-10-10 23:12:27
13408," year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape, we're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville, I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular, so fast that cities could no longer control it. An apink night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from a hundred AD countries in the single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of a hundred highly specialised agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at at Airbnb and, you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They are trained to hand all traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack and a lot of media are still in the city. Yeah, so what are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets, and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City, either back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1634,2022-10-10 23:16:40
13409," because it was one of the biggest markets, and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing strict regulations that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room, and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back, and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest. The kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb, partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations, and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? That was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or leave or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner of Odaiga, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame the Airbnb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1635,2022-10-10 23:20:53
13410," I'm going to go to the library and see what I can do. I'm going to go to the library and see what I can do. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors and arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom and when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what Airbnb's liability is here. You know, is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes, what he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. Sounds far-affectured at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of humankind's unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species station would be hit quadrace for the final scent of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupel. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty and it, I don't care who you are, it's always...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1636,2022-10-10 23:25:23
13411," One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the CUPLA. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty in it. I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing. And at an estimated cost of $150 billion, it's the most expensive object with ever built. You think about like the Sistine Chapel, the Pyramids, and the Burj Khalifa, or take your pick. I mean, it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000, it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed human kind to live, manufacture, and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning, I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down, floating everywhere I went. But your first impressions for ISS certainly is, it's how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan, and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. They're living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 meters in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope, and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's space operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-rth orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA. The goal being that NASA could be a customer, and we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transfrenching a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for. Like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems, but the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using them in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is, NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1637,2022-10-10 23:29:42
13412," with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today, so this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us all the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people in research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one 50th the cost of the ISS. I mean when you talk about our vision it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. That's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle, but one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk, to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one, release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1638,2022-10-10 23:34:03
13413," The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet has opened up a longer-term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars and if he's going at the pace he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architecture firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Marsha, the moon is to use what they call in situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moonha Marsha would be so absorbed into the expense of you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of bio polymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt, a rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material, it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs. And that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh. The cold, the low gravity, the value.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1639,2022-10-10 23:38:19
13414," You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh. The cold, you know, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, you know, and finding solutions for how to build or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant lightweight, cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI Space Factory hoped their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete, which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site, have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways that wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the Space Station on the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers historic had 39A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home. So we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do, because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. Music Music",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1640,2022-10-10 23:42:24
13415," This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. 10 years ago you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighborhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much. Folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before. Millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation. Be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. This is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced ubers and Airbnb's wants something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single and living in the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid and a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my and the area Austin, Texas, so they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic we just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like circa houses and cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. The houses weren't really being shown at that time, because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos. That is it.

People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listing. Our demographic is between...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1641,2022-10-10 23:47:05
13416," getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s, and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media. And they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pepe Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram, and within an hour you have 15-20 replies, saying, can I come see it directly with you? And let's see it tomorrow, and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quit-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say, you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, casper with mattresses or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. Ten years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. There's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information. But it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. In the pandemic, many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops. And so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to part.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1642,2022-10-10 23:51:21
13417," access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persists. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances but to partake in important conversations be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. Relic state ownership let's start small let's don't be scared to start small instead instead of renting a big house in the hills and California like most artists do buy you one that's on the flat. I meet folks like Brandon Ruhlin Charlemagne the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming up really home buying with a mysterious shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home but done in a with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIYing the entire closet. Heather having bought her fixer upper site on scene also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple do it yourself project you can do that. You have any questions go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products or look at our homes and say here's a turnkey. This can serve our family but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for you know working well as a family home that's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit but it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it budgeting for a lot of renovations. We kind of thought if we buy it at 4.50 we could put to 300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built in deep fryer which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram they say I love it can you come build this on my property and then they'll send us the lot which they bought site unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zone it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things so while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework. Don't believe everything you say that's not to say that you know there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1643,2022-10-10 23:55:37
13418," it around that racism. When I was 24 years old I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill. Oh, you're coming! I'm in a diet! And then at the end of the fight the combatants hugged they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a ballad athletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight. We choose to do this because we love this sport but it is a business and if you do not treat it like a business I guarantee you that the promoter is and you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fight over unionization in some sports, fight over free agency in baseball and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my job broken in two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice where my eye caved in, I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner. We've been friends with Lorenzo Fertida.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1644,2022-10-10 23:59:52
