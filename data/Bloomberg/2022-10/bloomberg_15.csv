14403," A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing, the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting, to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent, all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table. And people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, had to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken to two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, had to get that repaired. I've had a torn right labor in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye orbital fracture twice when my eye caved in. I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes will blow. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach Dana White and a casino owner he'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita, UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi pronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show the ultimate fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry. All throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show the ultimate fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. That is all down individually, put a contract in front of us and said, hey we realize this is going to be huge and we really want to have you all a part of this. UFC family moving forward so we want to go ahead and get this out of the way just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit. But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do, Dana White looks at me and says, don't worry, this thing takes off, we'll take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contract that it signs with fighters.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2629,2022-10-14 00:02:03
14404," at care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing. And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. Their long-term, they last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured. They control who the fighter fights, they control when the fighter fights, and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a creation. Contracts are so one-sided, there really is no negotiation room for any of the things, especially as you're coming up and as they're stranglehold on the sport of MMA, you got so much stronger. What's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC successfully took other competitors off the board. The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down, they really became the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally. If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube, you could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another company that tried to compete with the UFC. In 2011, UFC acquired Strike Force, which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing. The CEO of Strike Force Scott Koker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the Death Star trying to compete with UFC. Eventually when Strike Force was bought out by UFC, my only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract. Now I'm under a contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights, but five years later I'm still stuck in the contract. The month before UFC's parent company Zufa completed its acquisition of Strike Force, a UFC executive sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA. And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran afoul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh you want to fight for us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2630,2022-10-14 00:06:13
14405," World, there is no negotiating. These are our very strict, never-ending contracts, and that's the case for this day. The UFC just says, oh, you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that'll take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contracts that UFC imposed on them, they didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa, LLC, with fighters, Kung Lee, Nate Corey, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jackson came to me and says, hey, come, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that being affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, group of now all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case, where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsening. Usually, when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Monopsening is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and its revenue soars how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct the fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC, year after year, the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something I've had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached to the dogs the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer, just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just a brutal war.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2631,2022-10-14 00:10:48
14406," into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up and then you find out, oh that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Rating at tours. It's been driven by Conor McGregor's, been driven by Brock Lesnar's, been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release this from our contracts. You'll do fine without us, clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world-class organization, enhancing the brand of our athletes, and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter, with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC, and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We're in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport, and every other major sport has gone through what we're going through right now. We'll tell fighters, you know, just shut up, look at how lucky you are. Well no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters, and that's how we how we're made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2632,2022-10-14 00:15:09
14407," Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the seafloor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the U.S. the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our seabed than we do about the surface of the Moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the seafloor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the seafloor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor is being carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something you start to value it more. When you start to value something that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The seafloor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the seabed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present most people think that the seafloor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the seafloor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched seabed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the seafloor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in and it's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. Since seabed 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held onto that data and it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. As with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2633,2022-10-14 00:19:25
14408," Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to. Which then again feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century mapping technology was simple, usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcore is an 82 meter long research vessel, equipped with two multi beam Sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers of the sea floor. You know you go from somebody with a rope with some knots to sonar acoustics that is I call it math magic. But it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship. And we measure that time and we are able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across and they are traveling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and create a three dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you are in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you are holding a flashlight and you are shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely operative vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate seabed features up close. We have just crossed the 1000 meter mark. It is 4.6 degrees C and now we are going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500 meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well visited, well traveled, we are still finding new things. You don't know until you map it and so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old river beds that used to be there or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It is a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2634,2022-10-14 00:23:53
14409," Maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath. It's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge incidences. We go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We have come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm baked to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, cultured meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. Looks pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, cultured chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat-just, the company behind these chicken nuggets-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco and got their start in 2011, developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to feed the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2635,2022-10-14 00:28:16
14410," animal protein, we need to take a third today and it'll be more tomorrow of our world and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cows. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them and planting soil and corn, defeat the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families and from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way and those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Imitation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you also have a plant-based version, that's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we sort of need, if you will, an endgame to this problem and we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011 and essentially he was developing beef patty. It was a very expensive prototype, if I'm not mistaken above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef patty. It was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The weight that we grow and produce culture chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy for instance, be mercy cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by the isolation we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those derived from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eat just has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup Memphis meats has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, you know, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck so we wanted to show that the Memphis meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meat.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2636,2022-10-14 00:32:29
14411," I mean, love duck. So we wanted to show that we at Memphis Meets can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity in how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product of meat. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we give cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my girlfriend, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest in to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So I think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves those are the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. So the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, just a meaty chicken. I like chicken. No, the normal chickens eat. I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually. And there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergey Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants, such as Cargill and Tyson, have invested in space, it's this destructive potential of the market, as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracted investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population. And we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that. And we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really hopeful. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2637,2022-10-14 00:37:01
14412," Tobias talking is a very great pleasure to hear fans leave their homes safe even before getting an appetite. No. Impossible Foods might be the world's most ambitious company. Just listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry, not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. Let's call it artificial meat, the realest, the biggest burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when Impossible's newfangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astanked as my whole life, and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone called a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on earth, and if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flanchulence. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Impossible claims it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody, iron-rich taste like red meat. So him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the him. The studies on its safety are pretty short-term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe, and there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium, and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real. We're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, patterners colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love, and the Impossible Burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at a David Chanks' Mama Fuku. They went from sort of higher-end fine dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger, and then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2638,2022-10-14 00:41:10
14413," into higher-end burger restaurants, like Bare Burger and Mommy Burger. And then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all meat from plants. All meat from plants. This tastes like beef. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they say. It's just like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness. But the debate itself was fantastic free advertising, helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle. And then in the summer of 2019, into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour. And that is Beyond Meat, shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond Meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They're a huge market. China's a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogr supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know. Just out the way to see. It's safe to say Impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat, and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2639,2022-10-14 00:45:31
14414," This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything like that. No, that's very, very much. I like it better. What are a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It sits very close to Iran actually on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested in the region because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC. The crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialized in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China, Central Asia, into Europe, and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So up to 9.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2640,2022-10-14 00:49:31
14415," achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar, shot up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China-Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman I think in the 1950s. And so for a long time Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s it's wanted to build a port in Guadar, actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port, even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013 a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015 China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative. But five years later little has happened. When you look out at the port you can see it has only three births and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval forget. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term like it is set up in Djibouti where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost a sort of forward based resupply option. Something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen. They rely on access to the sea. The way that the highway expressed highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower of course in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well will just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese built community in Pakistan, a 500 million dollar development spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They are not against economic prosperity but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China.

14416," for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth or benefit from the projects that were set out and we're supposed to have seen by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase. There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. What is this bug? Jack is AI flipped out. It wasn't there before. Where's my gun? I can't shoot. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history. And it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer, CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marked by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big tempo release of last year. And for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far-reaching consequences. CD Projekt's origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market. And characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in<|pl|><|translate|> and buy in<|pl|><|translate|> and buy in the market down the street in Warsaw.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2642,2022-10-14 01:00:51
14417," You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy Ncd's. And these two guys, Marchin and Vinzki and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs. And they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which was kind of like the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. It was never a business, it was kind of lifestyle. So we're actually pretty bad with counting money. So you can kind of think of it almost like Nike, you know, where Phil Knight was selling shoes out of the trunk of his car. You know, you can kind of think about it the same way. It was, you know, just selling physical goods and then evolving that into a much broader enterprise. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language. But it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland. And so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland. And as CD Projekt released The Witcher 2, the video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Red had become this behemoth of an institution in Poland. And they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do and making a lot of money. And in 2011 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example. But it would be The Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the game's industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good. And Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions. And The Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted. And to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up, considering by 2014, The Witcher and The Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man, I have to pay a micro transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Oh, other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battle Front 2. They got really aggressive on micro transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well, gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there, and they don't like that. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers personal.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2643,2022-10-14 01:05:14
14418," CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again, we're gamers first of all, and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers, we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC was an absolutely no brainer. They said, we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and we're not doing anything to kind of screw fans over the way that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077. It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release. And then they showed off a trailer at the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman. And there was also some cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars, lots of stuff. But it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that Cyberpunk began really like building up this fever level of hype. CD Projekt Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show. And they showed off a, it was like a two minute trailer of Cyberpunk look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else who could get a score an appointment in there. They showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Projekt Red's upcoming title, Cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Po-ly. This, if they can live up to what they showed me, it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action, enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs, their thousands of them, each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to do. So yeah, so people were certainly blown away by this demo at 1 E3 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3. Studios put together builds of games to show off what they tend to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Projekt is very much a market and driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away, which it did. But that might have come to the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2644,2022-10-14 01:09:24
14419," Like sometime they could have been spending on the game. A year later, at E3 2019, fans will get another big surprise. Whoa! No way! Oh, what?! He's welcome. The idea of being there, of walking the streets of the future, is really going to be breathtaking. You're a bref! The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders, which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. When you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So, in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which is a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways, and the article kind of ran through why that was. Afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic. The direction keeps changing. Things are floundering. We're going through a lot of problems. This sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So, Marchinevinsky, who's a co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff, most of whom requested anonymity so as not to risk their careers. CD Projekt declined a comment on the process, or provide interviews with this story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberpunk's main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch, including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office, that the game was not going to be ready. But a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like we're created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. In game studios, some of them see crunch as part of their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at 8 weeks...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2645,2022-10-14 01:13:52
14420," to the magic recipe for creating good games. And that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting a new less and less productivity. And so these guys, the People at CD Project, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing. But in this case, it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us. Here is a shared vibe. So many pictures entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves, first crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview, saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it wasn't an attack on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt fast of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like, and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue MIRG News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack the regime, spy on enemies and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father Kim Jong-un thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2646,2022-10-14 01:18:38
14421," both Karujim and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. You know, he's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much dilapidated nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetrical weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyber hacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. Performally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describing accusations to that effect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Grand de facto community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a student studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do each China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2647,2022-10-14 01:22:24
14422," says the information. And he asked that he'd be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot. And from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the heart of a city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go on to this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to John were cracking open, commercially successful anti-virus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product, which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bot on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from clients was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. John had to make at least $100,000 in a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually, most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you and if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me, which is that on every Saturday, they have to do this propaganda session, which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea when he was in China during the propaganda sessions. He just couldn't take it. Jung was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jung would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details, but he calls it unsavory incident that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. And that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after affecting him. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody, just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean unit. He would take orders. He really did quickly as well.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2648,2022-10-14 01:26:56
14423," How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did at the North Korean Union. He would take orders, he would reverse engineer software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down. And he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea. He met a woman here. Last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. One day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And one day realized that there was a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. That little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service, and entertainment. The rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s. Sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls. And it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2649,2022-10-14 01:31:49
14424," decided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate start being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big usually a department store. So if you're thinking about macy's or sears or jacy penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops or even going to buy some food, but you really had to have, you know, a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail square footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail square footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis, lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. Mall started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off, and that's Sears, JC Penney. Several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Green Briar Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle-class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores, that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Green Briar had like the perfect template, but now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Green Briar then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middling malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores has a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middling mall survive? What's their next strategy?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2650,2022-10-14 01:35:28
14425," here Greenbrier is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,750 per year, and yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrier mall will see better days. Those are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrier is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in any respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburban house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great maceys, and you know, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that maceys is gone, Greenbrier may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z's. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. Once you win over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi-billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need, another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID and what is it now in a post-COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street Advisors, which rates American malls from A to D just like a report card. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. During the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade A minus or better. The B and C quality malls, which is the vast majority of the malls by count, we think are on a negative trajectory and it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership, decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B to D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2651,2022-10-14 01:40:02
14426," Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high-end. So I'm talking about Bal Harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There's Americana Man Haset in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high-end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also, they've invested a lot in their actual mall because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought-after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their big fulfillment centers. Also a lot of communities see this as an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows and turn it into office space. The sort of number two reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare or education. It's a great example of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-greening. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping and say farewell. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular.

14427," Company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time, joining the legal fracas was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I sent the cases still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government. And I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says both the assholes out, very implicit, running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says both the climate and the virus out of office, again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over $1 billion was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money. But by doing the right thing, it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows? I mean, Sean Arts has been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirt bad climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this. But what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur studied at Ju and I on the Lakewood, because they're saying, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I want to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered Mount. Patagonia was born out of rock climber of Von Schoenart's first business, Schoenart Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Ivan Schoenart was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, an activist company. Six months out of the year, Von Schoenart is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Von Schoenart and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. Mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s, climbing in the Samiti where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schoenart moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s, Patagonia.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2653,2022-10-14 01:48:34
14428," Shuunard moved from selling petons to polyester and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Shuunard and his wife Melinda opened the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Shuunard was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits like on-site childcare that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations, to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people and knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organizations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Shuunard labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's from an industry, it's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning the profit. It even made Ink Magazine's list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Shuunard or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it? Sales fell flat and the bank called in the companies revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. We're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle an organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Shuunard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in term languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday. Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Shuunard said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance on this is hypocritical is loud and constant talking about consumerism in a critical light while very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction. And not just destroying the environment but impacting humans.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2654,2022-10-14 01:52:50
14429," Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head-to-head with that is courageous. You're not only just trying to create a product that'll last but you're also educating an entire generation of people to understand that whole ideology that you don't need to change out our outfits. In 2014 Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. That to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants and this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales which is sizable and that's part of the reason why it's been such a for two-year cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things. It's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas including a venture capital fund for environmental causes and sustainable food revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017. But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavywaste like Nike who made $37 billion that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism you know a lot of the more sustainable parts of the supply chain are there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down the Patagucci label is is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active. For instance you know people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office and that's because of the image that the the brand projects and so they have to be with the fact although they you know preach for the environment and want to stand for good their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration now in 2020 things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business well to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration Patagonia appointed Brian Gillett as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship but Gillett still has his guard up. During the Obama administration they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House.

14431," music Okay, you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So really forward looking. Good. Okay. From one of the newest workspaces at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CFO, Ruth Porat. We're not far from her childhood home. Her father was a physicist at Stanford, her mother, a psychologist. After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Porat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Googleplex. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate. You're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington, DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well, at the core, we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses, but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three, two work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great, diverse populations. Soon, Dar just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously you're embracing this massive cultural shift. But what are the risks? You know, what do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life and coming into the office. So the risk is, I think about my career. And so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching, being pot-pronented meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of Alpha Bat, you were CFOs Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap and what impact did you want to have? Well, I love seeing it work in Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. On my view, in my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. And I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions, you started your career on Wall Street in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2657,2022-10-14 02:05:59
14432," Continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau the right questions what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious boys club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a boys club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? When I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it as the view is if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long term growth. I think if you don't you are sowing the seeds of your long term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. Now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition everything can't succeed. And so by definition you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working I would say one of two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough whether you're going to get there. So to me a really natural part, you know kind of the sister organization to investing for long term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risk that you're taking, stack rack them and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together actually. And so I find the narrative it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning, stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build a durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The hang calls at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long term growth because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume you know what we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back end. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular, as you're seeing us, go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2658,2022-10-14 02:10:20
14433," I think one of the biggest concerns in particular is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent. I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans? And your ability to compete? The main thing that we've done throughout the life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth. We're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions, and we're continuing to be active. More on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair. But we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? That's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is it they're trying to solve, and how can we constructively engage with them? At the same time, our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation. And I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing. Are you putting too many of your own products together? But during the pandemic, one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business, you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2659,2022-10-14 02:15:23
14434," good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said, you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important, and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through the products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects, but what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we are commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make. Privacy could protect it for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days, when I heard about this like eighth search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst Mary Meekers. She actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually maybe we do need something new? And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this eight never better experience for users. And so if we can, if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at for example in something like health where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There's also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent-teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guild.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2660,2022-10-14 02:18:58
14435," Can I ask about the 3D model? What did you do until ༼ morning? I have a special gloves that I need at home waiting too long. When I went for a walk, I told everyone else too, like Peel and Demon 중에. 📣 And mine! We ate the Health Trees along the way, all along the way. You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it. And I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years? And I froze because it was, I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable. Not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there. And I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. That's what I did. You're a mom of three sons. And I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try it for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope. And you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. We had a cubicle. There was a computer room. You were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay. So even when you feel it, just say, you know what? It's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level if I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt and when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, I'll never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the essence of which was, I get why you're doing this. And they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2661,2022-10-14 02:23:20
14436," I'm doing this and they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride, I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt. No mom guilt. It's not allowed. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to do it? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? So I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan Stanley. I'm like do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I, when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't but I can't not tell somebody so I'm going to email you. And I'm like okay that's step one. I'm going to step one. Step one. Step one. Do not tell your boss. You're tell your boss you know what I need to do certain things for myself and I'm getting I feel guilty doing it but I get everything done. There's no question you are so beyond having to check in with people. Well thank you. Do not. We're in the middle of this so called great resignation and people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this you know big evolution you know huge choices ahead? Well I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle and people are reflecting on what do they want and how do they want to work and how do they want to live their life. So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions it is about evolving the way we work the way we interact the expectations that we have to say but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders and I think that our this generation appropriately and it's very exciting expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission are you delivering on the mission is really important. Okay so if you rapid fire questions someone you'd love to have dinner with. Oh well I'd love to say my parents because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five the five different locations and then we all vote and then we get the grid and that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably I would say maybe Iceland was the vast that's an amazing one. New York or California? Oh so unfair. Well sitting here outdoors right now and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years pretty nice but the energy from New York so I'm not going to it's like my I don't pick amongst children. So in closing Google is a massive company multiple divisions many bets where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very morning question about capital allocation because if it really goes to this core point you've got to invest for long term growth and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity I often say I don't want to get to the two-yard line but not score so you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long term growth that's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time and then of course you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role of change they really they were very serious about moving to this board role and they've been they're amazing board members. One dollar of course relies on them for council wherever whenever but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level and spend great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like? I work closely with Sundar and.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2662,2022-10-14 02:27:46
14437," really around what are we doing at the board level and send great and you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with the Sundar and Phillip and Thomas. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? You know, it's fascinating to was I think I had the same reaction you did when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot and I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where so many people are coming online and you know is video going to be the first the way they understand it's going to be about you know search is going to be a different type of experience so much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation so there's going to it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally like what where will you you know it's been so amazing to hear about your journey and I'm just curious about your personal growth like what you feel you've accomplished in the last you know since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things and as we think about well what does that mean for each one of our areas there's I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young and I think that continuing to learn is like your brain is like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions so to me it's continuous learning. Report thank you so much for joining us it's been wonderful to be here. Thank you great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. So sorry I'm late and I'm kind of late but not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50 000 times. So you're doing well. Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week yeah. How about you I guess you come in. Yeah I'm in every day now so no more kids on the set. I have to ask is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night he's like that you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like no no I didn't but yeah the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology which is which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go and you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View California this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO Sundar Pachai. Born and raised in India Pachai had almost no access to a computer until college but just years later found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015 it was Pachai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion it's one of the most",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2663,2022-10-14 02:31:55
14438," Chai, that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches are biggest moonshodas company. People will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making order delete the default setting for new users signing in. And now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust in us in vulnerable moments. Maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. You know, there's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government. I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook follow out that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, tech addiction, algorithms, YouTube even on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something, I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns, you know, we invested, it became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children, so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying we think about content responsibility first.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2664,2022-10-14 02:36:18
14439," And so the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first, and then the pace of development for new features in areas like YouTube. And so that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So we've always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in. Is that count as the metaverse? Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. And you know, but I think this doesn't belong to any company, right? I mean, this is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give, you know, agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of three, two. And what we're giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks, they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. And forever. Forever, yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it to all it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2665,2022-10-14 02:40:48
14440," Here it is. You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experience shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? I grew up in Chennai, India and a big part of my childhood was really pretty severe water scarcity. We would get water trucked in for the streets and stand in lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. Fast forward a few years ago, Chennai had one in a hundred year flood, which was a very extreme event. Kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago, waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, seeing the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard, the issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult. You have to keep the economies growing. It really matters. But at the same time, it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris agreement. So I can see the forward progress. There is a deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So we are now pushing. It's a moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send, that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. And the wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal in Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. Over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of that, there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore and the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? It's such a 13 time frame. Glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from a part of the world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2666,2022-10-14 02:44:56
14441," leapfrogging trends which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. So a chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region and so I think it will transform. The first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. Over the past few years we are beginning to build things there and some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. You can't talk about APAC without talking about China and you are facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. When you look at areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot, Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, I was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow about the US China agreement on climate. To me while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together and so I think that's a way by which we think about as when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? Today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing but there are ways as I said in areas like AI or sustainability. I think there will be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere and so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know done correctly in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today for example in India over one third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time you'll expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world and you know those are all ways it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things maybe giving them a second opinion. These are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll see that if it's a fact. You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns. There are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and anytime you're developing technology there is a dual site to it. I think the journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways I'm encouraged by how much concern there is and you're right even within Google you know people think about it deeply. We publish a lot of research. There are I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well.

14442," There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institution, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention, which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza is learning cook which I was never good at. I'm caught on a little bit better. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walk out? For me, it was a moment. I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we've stated clear goals. We are on track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem. But we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder. Going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting edge things. Many people come in, people leave Google, we are proud of people who have left Google that are over 2000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zooklers. I'm equally proud of that. We are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We are going to do rapid fire to get to know you a little bit better. You said you would pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Pizza, cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Boat. Please don't make cookies. Squid game or Ted Lasso.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2668,2022-10-14 02:54:18
14443," Peter soccer slash football. Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make a quiz. OK. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more common. And so I'd rather take Ted Lasso over Squid Game's any day. I know you're a voracious reader. So what's the last good book that you read? You know, I've been on a podcast bench. So a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. OK. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos, music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So watching other games, et cetera, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. And what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so. How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me. And they show it on their phones. So that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. And making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. But I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up mapping for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did. I've dabbled in it, but in and out. In and out. OK. Larry and Sergey, I'm not going to make you choose. How many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly. It kind of ebbs and flows. And so there are times we get excited about something. And we spend a lot of time talking it through. But it depends on what I need. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s. And a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be being patient. I think when you're young, you're very impatient, which is a great thing. But sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time. And so I would advise the younger version of me to be more patient. Maybe at 40, I would say, when I look at climate, and I want all of us to be impatient. So I feel like when there's an urgency towards something, I think the world needs to be impatient. So that's the advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make? And how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of Alphabet, not just Alphabet, but also Google? Yeah. I'll look on the first one. There are moments we all have to make tough decisions. And some decisions weigh on me. But it's a privilege to do it. I have very good people helping me think things through. So I think the combination makes it all fine. On the second thing, I'm so energized by the things we need to do. I didn't have much access to computing growing up. It changed my life a lot. The one laptop or child goal really motivated me to come into technology. And when I look at last week, us launching a affordable smartphone in India, the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online, that gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar. Sundar Pachai, thank you so much for joining us. Thanks, Emily. Bless you be here. How ever you get your news. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's go to Bloomberg.

14445," MUSIC MUSIC Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Annie Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion-dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company, and my Apple news alerts went off like everybody else's did. And it's at Jeff Bezos, who's taking on a new role, and Andy Jassy's taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course, Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course, I reached out and congratulated him, and we started talking. And the conversation turned to some of the possibilities. And next thing I know a little while later, here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process, did you talk to Jeff as well? Yeah, I had some communication, but it was, you know, principally with Andy, who of course was, you know, knew the AWS business best, and of course, it's taking on the CEO role. But yeah, there was contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me, nothing I needed reminding, but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business. And we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the cloud, that it's anything close to mature. And so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry, innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well, I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean, it was a pretty decent sized business when I left, but it's really grown and the customer base has really expanded. And so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level, the CIO level across every country, every industry, every use case. And we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at Real Networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. It was very secret. So it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it. But of course, we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got went something like, we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people. And it sounded intriguing, although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about. So I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff. And I would have to say that even by the time I took the job, I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about. And it sounds like a good idea and I'm in. But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes and Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2671,2022-10-14 03:06:45
14446," But I also was like, well, we'll just have to see how it goes. And Amazon's a big, big place. And so I think we got a lot of intent to succeed here. And that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start? And do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the time to market advantage that we had, which was probably honestly five to seven years, head start before other companies really started to take this seriously was. And frankly, it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years. Because at the beginning, a lot of people didn't get it. I would get asked a lot in 2006. So what does this have to do with selling books? And I even had a slide with a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it. And the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books. But the technology which enables us to sell books, being global, being at a massive scale, being secure, being low cost, being highly performant. All that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore. And you do have big rivals, even though AWS is still the leader, Microsoft and Google are big rivals. How do you make sure that being big doesn't slow you down? It's a great question. We are currently the leader. And I mean, depending on which third party you look at, we're probably a little bit more than twice as big as number two. And it's really important to continue to act as if we're insurgents and to be insurgents. And not to start to act like incumbents. And I like to talk about actually managing the business. We want our senior leaders to be managing product and managing customers. And I think as you get bigger and you put more and more layers into your company, it's all too frequent that you start managing math. You start managing ratios and percentages and growth. And I think it's a real disease if you stray away from really focusing at a deep way on the product you're building and at a deep way on what your customers are telling you. And so we try and organize both with our org structure as well as just with our culture and what we choose to focus on on really making sure that everybody is thinking about one or both of those two things, product and customers. And if you keep even the most senior leaders engaged at that level, then all of a sudden, you maintain the urgency and you keep acting like an insurgent. We got to feel that urgency every day. So keep acting like an insurgent. That's the motto. Absolutely. Instructure yourself and build a culture that allows you to. It's one thing to say it. But it's easy to say it. But it's much harder to put in place enabling mechanisms that enable you to do so. And we focus a lot of effort on those mechanisms. Now, do you think the cloud keeps getting bigger? And that AWS and Microsoft and Google just get bigger pieces of an ever-expanding pie? Or at some point, does it become a zero-sum game? And that fight for market share becomes more brutal and more bloody. Well, this is a very large market segment. If you look at global IT spend, it's in the trillions of dollars. I've seen estimates like $3 trillion. It doesn't really matter how many trillions it is. It's very, very large. And we've always believed that this was too good a market segment opportunity for the really to only be one winner. And sure enough, you've seen robust competition emerge. And we all compete vigorously. But it is. The segment is just growing so rapidly that I think, really, for us, we believe that the winning business strategy for a long time to come and I would maintain forever is to focus not on the competitors, but to focus maniacally on customers and wake up every day understanding exactly what it is that they need us to build next. And then work backwards from there, back internally to how can we build those things. And if we do the best job at building the most quickly, the things that are most important for our customers, then I'm really not worried about what the competitors will do. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows, but you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2672,2022-10-14 03:11:07
14447, We worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're gonna get me in trouble aren't you? Let's see if Andy gets in trouble. You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. You're going to get me in trouble aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams so I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers yeah so what are you going to do? So he's I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams particularly the new hockey team the Kraken here as he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because you know Jeff's Jeff Andy's Andy and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS which is one important part of the business and well having operated that business for so long and I expect that will also give him an opportunity although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years will be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS and I think that fresh perspective is often helpful I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business for customers for employees and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? Well I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday and right after I joined we actually added two new leadership principles which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility and those are things about which I personally am very passionate and so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer and then also to figure out externally what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities to be great citizens of our national communities and to be great citizens of...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2673,2022-10-14 03:15:26
14448," And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? He's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon, and so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, we, the business grew, but this, Jeff was always available when we needed him, and I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now, and what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have, and it's been great to have Jeff weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond, and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business, and it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, what we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did. I've got to tell you, I'm Iuse, but it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna, because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving, and they've been so innovative and so creative. Moderna took a drug development process to get to the vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side, reduced that 20 months to 42 days, 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And that was really running on running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing, with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology, and rather letting Moderna focus on the all-important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau. Does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP Plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused, and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2674,2022-10-14 03:19:46
14449," What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused and I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, their diverse. We have to match that diversity. And also I just believe that it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. Yeah, any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture, to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation-led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. You know, we, I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I, just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? It's such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. We are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year, every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information? Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sense of...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2675,2022-10-14 03:23:44
14450," data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we've built a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning which is required to create, compelling a delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, so Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic runs almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only gonna grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's gonna be? Such an interesting sentence, the metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best, which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now I know that climate change, and stopping climate change, and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad or climate pledge that Amazon created, and to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chassie is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements, but with partar stora ferre Allahu Akbar, yer prue fellas we all.

14451," back to here. We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube, Susan Wigitsky. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watched video on YouTube is baby shark. Baby shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2677,2022-10-14 03:32:32
14452," Since 2016, how do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and in technology things move so quickly, so a lot of things have changed since 2016. And I mean overall I've been really pleased that we've continued to grow and grow our ecosystem of creators. I'm with invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us. And you know with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed certainly has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that was, that's been the mean way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video. And I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main value of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue. And that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself. And that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spot like when they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy. And because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what they're telling or their interest is whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube. And in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. Well, and for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook and Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like, how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent. Something I want to share with the world. Like, and YouTube can help that be known. Can help them provide that fame. But also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made the announcement that we were going to do 100 million.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2678,2022-10-14 03:37:04
14453," And how do you see YouTube, the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator. We have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and underrepresented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. We all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube, for us, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18-second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found and then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are our own metrics. Do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this treehouse, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosity, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2679,2022-10-14 03:41:21
14454," vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk. We've taken responsibility very seriously. We came up with 10 different policies around COVID. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. Which is just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the... Right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so, I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? How much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not... They are like improvising in some way. Like, we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand and then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate, should we be making changes to our policies? YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience and what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning? As a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out I'm the CEO of YouTube, almost always they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or something they're a family member who learn. So, I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online and we had all the home schooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just... And that I really saw was a need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube and there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot and sometimes more than I want them to be and sometimes it's super productive and they're learning something cool and sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable and of course safe? It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids. Which is a separate app which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2680,2022-10-14 03:45:50
14455," YouTube we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality and we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know, there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest they usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app and so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users, the influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic and we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or how do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice. And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health and that for a lot of kids it's really like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about, is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mind? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family, whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kids can only see these 10 videos and so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well intended but actually then has a really negative impact. Good. One last really good icon! I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol, like all Americans I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? I was VERY surprised at Biden's ban on perfektion answering this recent tänger the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2681,2022-10-14 03:50:11
14456," Violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? Election integrity is something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders the same as we treat any individual. And so meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. What was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important and we also are global. So we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that are and there continue to be a number of leaders that post or that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals were seen from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, that's a core value of ours. And when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Now, Vali said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos, was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And we look and consider why are we getting the request what's actually happening on the ground. And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg, we've seen Jack Dorsey now testify before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do get a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sender has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. If not the most senior woman at Google, Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts. And there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2682,2022-10-14 03:54:29
14457," And I mean, I think at Google there are many efforts and there's a lot of a lot of work that has been done and I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress, but it's still hard. It's harder to be a woman in technology. It's harder to be a minority of any kind. And so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago, I asked you about being a mom, you have five kids, and you said something that really stuck with me. You said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better. I see something growing fast and I run towards that. If something's growing closely, I'm like, I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, prioritization is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity. There's a lot of moving pieces, very dynamic environment. So if you can prioritize and say, these are the most important things to do, then you're going to get there faster. Lauren, start. I have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that aren't yet doing. And I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects or I feel like, I don't have that much more to add, then it'll probably be time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sundar is doing a great job. Very, very, please. I think he's doing. I mean, it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product, a lot of different issues. And I mean, I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not work wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean, sometimes it would be casually, but our business is very complex right now. There's a lot of things that are happening and so it's hard for, I mean, people may have different opinions, but to really engage, it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel, to have an audience. I just met with a number of three creators and YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened. And so that's certainly one, continuing to grow that. I'd say a second, it's been really important to me to see a lot more women in technology. That has been just a personal goal of mine is to be a role model and try to support women. And I feel very fortunate to have gotten to where I have and I know it was due to like many different factors and I want to support the next generation of women and see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful and then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education.

14459," There's to be preparing to abandon a central part of her plan following weeks of chaos in financial markets. Sparking speculation, the chance that Quattang will be forced to quit, but he says he is staying defiant. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on 31 October as I said earlier in a week and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. And Dubai Rensko's stratospheric with the average Villainai costing more than $73,000 a year after a 26% surge does it threaten the Emirates attractiveness as a destination for living. It's just gone 8am across the Emirates. You're welcome to the show. A monster set of reversals from rhetoric, policy and markets. Take a look at the stock market. You're looking at not just one of the biggest reversals on record on the day that saw the hottest CPI princes, 1982. Either Tiger from the Rocky movie, sung by Survivor, was there. Now this is a monster move. Don't forget, we wiped out 2.4% of a loss on the back of the print and then the reversal came. We moved from sell everything to buy everything. Jamie Dheim in the King of Wall Street still says there's another 20%. Another $6 trillion could come off. These equity markets are soft landing is unlikely. His gut tells him we're going to get to 4.5% to 5%. There's a couple of things perhaps just saving the stock market. A 50% retracement from the highs in the S&P post pandemic to where we are. And sniffing the 200 day moving average. So that is the stock reversal. The monster buy everything. Then let me show you the immediacy of reaction to the hottest print since 1982 on Core CPI. Not just will the Fed have to talk Volker. They will not have to walk Volker. And what does that mean as 2s ramped by 24 basis points. The highest since 2007. The question is this, not just 50 basis points, 75 basis points. I'll almost lay my entire year's salary. You're going to get notes in your box and I'm talking about 100 basis point moves from the Fed. You don't want to know my salary. Right. Let's have a look at the point. Here we go. This is reverse. And Maccavelli moves by number 10 to on seat the policies of number 11 gives the point. And alpha like we haven't seen before. Rally is the most in two years. 30 year government bonds. Bailey won. Bailey won the war. He forced the politicians into a U turn and the bump market has reacted. Julie, it's Ali standing by with all the reaction in Singapore. Jules. Manas, did you put your salary into the NK? Look at that 3.5% gain coming through on that index. The most since March as we see this rebound coming through across Asian equity markets rising after five sessions of losses and really taking that lead from the rebound that we saw on Wall Street. We've got Asian stocks also at their highest since March and of course the again steady after its fall fell to its lowest level in around 30 years. Now we did have Singapore's central bank tightening its monetary policy today. It does that with its exchange rate. So you have been seeing a big rise coming through in the sink dollar against the green back. It is actually rising the most since May and remaining one of these very resilient strong currencies amidst weakness across so many Asian currencies. And let's have a look at China's economy too as we look ahead to the party congress on the weekend. We did actually see the China CPI data they're missing the estimate but CPI still rising to its highest since April 2020 and the PBOC's eGung saying that China consumer prices are basically stable. A lot of this upside in that 2.8% reading is really to do with food prices and we're looking at trade data as well. The market watching its impact on the one as the offshore needs a record low against the dollar. Manas. No, if this year's salary if I had all that excess cash to put to deploy someone I'm not so sure they would all go into the next day. But listen, leave you with that. No, we're not allowed to trade.

14460," you Jews, we just suffer in silence with mutual funds. At Jews, thank you very much. Julie and Sally Ed Sengapur. Okay, let's talk about the hopes for the Fed to consider dialing back their aggressive rate hiking path. Well, I got dashed on that hotter than expected C.V.I. print. And Akarm is standing by, Ender. I love what Tom Warwick said, which is they have walked, they've talked Volker, they're gonna be forced into walking Volker. So where are we on 75 basis points? And would you bet your salary that you'll get a 100 basis point, analyst note in your inbox before the day's out? I think it's only matter of time before that does come in, manus. It does feel like, in fact, I read a good notice morning saying, forget November, that's a done deal for 75, if not higher, like you say. The big question now is, December, do they go by 75 or higher even then? Remember, that was meant to be the point of year when the Fed was starting to cool back a little bit or at least slow as pace of tightening. But as you mentioned, cornflation came in at 6.6%, it's been a high in 40 years, that's when ET was in the movies, headland inflation, still over 8%, food prices up by 11%, it's showing that inflation is policymakers, both for the Fed, and by the way, the political cycle given the elections that President Biden has coming up in November. So when you look at it all told, it certainly dashes the pivot story. It lends itself to an even more aggressive Fed from here. And of course, that won't be just a US story. That will start to increasingly spill over to the rest of the world through a stronger dollar and rising rates everywhere else too. Now listen, there's only one person on this show gets pop culture references. And don't be trying to get into my zone. You're an economist. You're an economist. I'm just an ex-broker doing a day's work here. Look, rent is over a third. The cost of rent, single units, et cetera, is about a third of the CPI. You can qualify that for me in a tighter way. But that is the component most people are worried about. Now yesterday, the channel on Bloomberg TV was that maybe it could be incrementally topping out. Is there any evidence whatsoever that that could be a near-term trajectory? I mean, rents go up, but they don't drop like a stone. Do they usually? Usually. Yeah, there's a complication with rents in that part of the base effect going on that reflects a big correction in rents during the pandemic year and the downturn when landlords could rents trying to get tenants in and they're trying to get those rents back up to where they want to be. So there's a bit of a base effect going on. Nonetheless, though, I don't see anyone really calling a dramatic cooling in the rental market. In the broader story, there had been some expectations, gas prices might come off, and that might start to take pressure off the broader inflation story. But I think the takeaway from last night's number really was that inflation is broadening out. It's looking to be more enduring now than anyone expected earlier in the year. Looking to be more sticky. And I think the question becomes it's no longer about has inflation peaked or not. It's where it will settle. And what will it take the inflation back down to whatever level that will be? So I think it feels like, Miles, we've entered into new terrain now with US inflation story is a long way to go and it's to fed up a lot of work to do. And of course, that will increasingly make the prospects of a soft landing, even less likely, I think. Yeah, as the King of Wall Street said himself, he's very skeptical. A soft landing is unlikely for the US economy. For anybody in any dough to the King of Wall Street is, that's Jamie Diamond. Ena, thank you very much. Endoccurren, our resident expert on the daybreak Middle East show for economics. Well, inflation, the reading is out now, as Ena was just saying, and it's not good news for the president, is it? And the White House, they're coming just weeks ahead of these midterm elections. And Biden had this to say in the wake of the latest numbers. Americans are squeezed by the cost of living. It's been true for years and folks don't need to be to report to tell them they're being squeezed. Fighting this battle every day is the key reason why I ran for president on the States. Meanwhile, JP Morgan CEO, Jamie Diamond, isn't optimistic about a recession being avoided. I don't know if it could be a soft landing. I don't think so, but it might mild recession or tough recession. My point in the tough recession, yeah, you expect the market under the 20 to 30%. I'm not going to give odds across those three things, but for all of us who have to worry about risk, yeah, of course, you should plan for those things.

14461," You know, for all of us who have to worry about risk, you have, of course, you should plan for those things. Faisal Hassan is my guest, CIO, head of asset management at Al-Mal-Kampel. You're in the eye of the storm. The eye of the tiger was number one. In 1982, you might remember that from our youth. The highest print on course CPI since 1982. The confluence of this, mortgage rates at 7%, inflation at 6.2%, 6.6%, how much of a headwind is it to the outlook for the US economy? Let's start there and then we'll pivot to stocks. I think, first of all, it's nice to be back on the show. I think they let the inflation sort of go out of hands, the Fed and the central banks. And I think now they need, they need to be a significant economic damage if they have to control the inflation because inflation has its own flow. So as you said, the rents do go down like a drop. Similar is the case with inflation. It's a more sort of sticky number, which is going to take around some kind of a major sort of event or major kind of policy measures in order for inflation to go down. So what is that due to the risk? And it said it's neither debate, not just about 75 basis points next month, but also in December another 75 basis points. I mean, do we begin to talk about a hundred basis point Volker's style move? Is that now going to become part of the lexicon over the next 10 days? Probably yes, markets will be talking about. And when we were talking about the terminal rate, I think 5% was kind of a thing that we were saying that it's way too much. And now I think the markets are talking about the terminal rate in the range of 4.75% to around 5.5%. That's where we are looking at it. So I won't be surprised, but right now we are looking at 75, but on the December 75 is very much on the cards. And we might continue it in first half of 23 as well. Now, in the space of 11 minutes, we've baked a cake. It's called the volatility cake. The 2.6% implosion inequities. It'll come now in just a moment. And the rally of 2.4% from sell everything. To buy everything. 5%. We have not seen a turnaround day like this since 1990. In 1990 was my first year as a trainee stockbroker. So it took me through why we sold everything. And they bought everything. I think the markets were obviously looking at the inflation numbers. And the only possible reason, and we were all all under the blue, is that they said that probably the inflation has peaked. So that's probably the market. But one thing is for sure, this kind of a wild swing is not the last time we are seeing probably this year. We might see much more. So I think we have to brace for the very high volatility. And we'll have to brace ourselves for that. It's interesting. You say that a recession in itself will not be enough to bring inflation dying. So you're looking for a double negative punch of a recession. Qualify that for me. And the scale, you're not talking about 5% and 1,5% rates. It needs to be both those toxic elements. I think it needs to be because first of all, I think the fed target rate of 2% is, I think, beyond the picture. So they will probably not be able to achieve it. So we are talking about a target rate of around 3% or so. So that's where I think they will have to work on a serious economic damage, actually. So then the consequence of that is Jamie Diamond says another 20% I want to make sure that I'm correct. Easily another 20%, another 6 trillion, and a soft landing nose on light. His gut tells him 4.5% to 5%. With the combination you've just outlined, is there another 20% down side in stocks? And was that a fool's pardon that the market got yesterday? Was squeeze a short entry squeeze? Probably, yes. And we might see the most important thing I think we'll have to see is the corporate earnings that will come. So that will dictate. And I think still, in my view, the analysts still have not big in the kind of economic changes that are happening in their estimates, especially for 20, 23. So once we see with the banks coming in very soon and the quarterly earnings, I think we will then see what the analysts, expectations are, how the expectations are changing. I think we are still a bit more optimistic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2687,2022-10-14 04:16:12
14462," What are the earnings? I think we will then see what the analyst expectations are, how the expectations are changing. I think we are still a bit more optimistic on the earnings. OK, and just finally to close off on credit, you're negative on credit, but how much more of an explosion or depth charge will there be? In credit spreads, will it be minimal or will it be quite a substantial move on investment grade spreads? It can be a good sort of move on both sides, and again, we are sort of pre-fringed investment reads over high yield, because right now you can get easily a 4-6% having some commercial paper, treasuries, and it's a space to be in. But then again, we are much more sort of pre-fringed, the defensive rather than the high-beta names. You're not just throwing the money well in early roundings. You cannot in this market. Fiesel, you don't strike me as a man that will throw money easily around in this market. Fiesel, thank you so much for being with us.

Manes, the UK Chancellor has cut short his US trip, a mid-report that lives Truss's government. It's preparing to abandon plans for a massive package of unfunded tax cuts. Bloomberg's been told no changes are likely before Pussy Quarting and the Prime Minister have had a chance to work on new ideas over the weekend. The British government's controversial fiscal plans have royalled UK markets for the past three weeks. About 2000 police patrolled a busy Beijing intersection after footage emerged of a rare protest against Xi Jinping, a head of the Communist Party Congress. Social media posts showed two banners calling for Xi's ouster and criticising his COVID policies. The incident comes at a sensitive time for Beijing, with authorities on high alert, a head of the Party Congress on Sunday, where Xi is expected to secure a third term as president. The international energy agency is warning that the decision by OPEC plus for a steep output cut may push prices to levels that tip the global economy into recession. The IEA slashed global oil demand growth forecast for 2023 by roughly 20 percent to 470,000 barrels a day, due to stronger economic headwinds ranging from inflation to higher interest rates. Twitter's lawyers say Elon Musk is being investigated by federal authorities in relation to his attempt to take the social media company private. Twitter is asking a Delaware court for access to correspondence muck's muck has given to authorities in that investigation, saying the documents will bear on key issues in its litigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission is deepening its probe into the use of outside messaging services and is now looking into the practice and investment firms as well as at major banks.

14463," What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. China's Communist Party Congress begins this weekend with a host of challenges facing the nation's leadership for more. Let's get to our North Asia correspondent, Stephen Engel. Stephen, I was just opening this morning's story. A trader's guide to China's must-watch party Congress, so which part of this guide do I need to focus the most? Yeah, well, it's all going to depend on what Xi Jinping says on Sunday in his, what will likely be a very lengthy speech, could be upwards of three hours where he outlines his policy priorities for the next at least five years. And who knows that we do know that he's essentially secured a, going to secure a president's defying third consecutive term. So that essentially means he could rule indefinitely. So these policies could be very important. And he's also, we need to watch for the stacking of his all-powerful standing committee, whether he gets through all his loyalists. And if he does, if that seven member standing committee is all Xi protégés, his mandate is pretty well secure. But he has a lot of challenges. Obviously, some would say of his own doing because of COVID-0 and the drags on the economy, as well as the crackdown on property over leverage. So if he says anything about stimulus to the property sector or lack thereof, if he says anything about giving a roadmap out of COVID-0 and allowing the economy and the borders to open up a little bit more, that would be news. And anything he says on Taiwan, as well as China's position vis-a-vis the United States and the rising tension over chips, over Taiwan, over Russia and the war in Ukraine, anything he says essentially right now because it's a blank slate right now. We don't know what he's going to say, could potentially be news. Will it move markets? We'll have to see. There you go. The phonics of, I'm not so sure, I might be busy with news, but I'm not sure sure it's going to change the dark of markets. Well done, Steven. Listen, we'll see you on Monday. Make sure you've got a bit more than, you know, you never know. Steven, thank you very much in Hong Kong. Watching the pivotal moment in Chinese history with a mood, Steven Engel in Hong Kong.

There's that word, metaverse. Good, well, how are you good? When I think about the metaverse, I think about immersive experiences that have a sense of active presence. Wow, look at this. This is me. The metaverse is projected to become over a trillion dollar market by the end of this decade. And whether you know it or not, you'll probably be working there in the future. We're moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. I think the adoption curve is going to be slow. It's weird, a real floaty thing right now. Oh, look at you. You have no legs. It's kind of a fun world and we're just at the very beginning of a very long journey. It's clear that inflation is a challenge. It is a global challenge. We are seeing some progress. If you look at annualized headline inflation over the last three months, it was about 2%. That's down from 11% in the prior quarter. Now a lot of that is the significant reduction in energy prices and in gas prices at the pump. Top-biden economic advisor Brian D's, they're speaking to Bloomberg after the CPI print. They came in at the hottest level and highest since 1982. Let me get you up to speed with the business slash headlines from around the world. The Zuhil Financial Group has emerged as the suger for part of Credit Suisse's Securitized Products Business. So what's to say, the Japanese bank is competing against interest from Apollo, global, and the same code are just some of the names in the frame.

Our top stories this morning, US CPI, comes in at the hottest levels in 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the economy. 75 basis point hike this month is all but solidified.

Jules, Sally is standing by in Singapore. Jules, I'm not all in on the neck. But gosh, I wish I was. What are we now? I can't see that far. Yeah, 3.4% on the neck. A matter. That is the biggest jump that we have seen since March and helping to propel the broader regional index. It's best day since March as well after we've had five sessions of losses. So we're certainly taking that tailwind that we saw coming through from the end of the US session with that big rally coming through into the Asian session two. And of course, we're looking to the party Congress in China as well. You can see on the lunch break, the CSI 300 is up some 2% well above that 3800 point level. Now, even though as we discussed earlier, we saw inflation still subdued in China. But of course, everyone getting very excited about what potential policy support we could see from the party Congress over the weekend. Also watching big moves in currencies. We've been looking at this volatility in the yen a little bit more steady after falling to that near more than 30 year low against the dollar on the back of that CPI read. And have a look here at the Singapore dollar to this is one currency that has been incredibly resilient amongst dollar weakness. And it is the tool that the monetary authority of Singapore uses in relation to its monetary policy. So they have tightened that band and you have seen the same dollar rise the most since May up by some 6 1% of 1% against the dollar $1.42. Okay, Jules, thank you very much. Juliet, Sally there in Singapore. You almost got a second question, Jules, but that's that's for later in the show. That's for later in end daybreak year. Let's talk about the IMF managing director. The warnings are in that the fight against inflation is the highest priority right now in order to ensure that the global economic growth prospects continue are helped. Christina Georgieva spoke to Bloomberg's Tom Keane in Washington. The most important task we have to secure our economies is to win the fight against inflation. And that means for central banks to show the result that is necessary. And why do we need to win this war? Because if you do not have price stability, we undermine prospects for growth. And because we hit incomes of people. But moving quickly, the US real year, the Jim Carran of Morgan Stanley just mentioned most 10 basis points, the two year year lows, I believe 18 basis points. Do you suggest with the IMF suggest central bankers, including Chairman Powell, that they need to slow down the dialogue and the certitude, the rhetoric and extend the timeline out, even at sacrificing a higher inflation to provide for financial stability? What we are suggesting is that the Fed needs to continue to be data driven. They need to look at the economy. They need to look at where the signals are in terms of our reaching price stability or not. And then they need to look at the impact their decisions would have domestically, but also internationally. Let's remember, title of financial conditions also mean stronger dollar, also mean capital outflows from emerging marketing developing economies. Of course, the Fed is primarily focused on domestic conditions. The responsibility of the Fed is price stability in the United States. But also the Fed has been quite active to think of ways to support global stability, especially through extending swaps lines to a number of countries. We have a set update on that right now. We talk to the people of the Green Book, the Financial Stability Book. What is the IMF present tone on the quality of the liquidity in the market given this inflation report this morning? We have...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2692,2022-10-14 04:37:39
14467," What is the IMF's present tone on the quality of the liquidity in the market given this inflation report this morning? We have seen financial stability risks increasing, but we are still primarily concerned about inflation running out of control. If it maintains so stubborn as it has been so far, then the most significant risk we face is that inflation expectations de-anchor. And when they de-anchor, that means that pressure on wages to go up would fuel inflation from other directions. And then the job of the Fed would become harder and it needs to tighten even more. So as the US core CPI hits a 40 year high, let's look at the inflation narrative from a global perspective to the GCC data for Dubai is due any day. It currently running at 6% a thorough preside, macroeconomics director at NASA's AED, associates is with me. A theory great to have you with us, look the highest print since 1982 on the core number in the United States of America. I feel inflation when I go to Spinis, my neighbours have seen the rents go up by 30%. What are you expecting the transfer of global inflation will be first of all to the UAE? And then we can expand into society. Let's start with the UAE first of all. Hi, manas, thank you for having me back on the show. Well, Dubai specifically where we get the monthly numbers, we have seen a gradual hike in terms of overall inflation, but it's been mainly driven by food prices, transport prices and to a certain extent recreation culture and such activities. Housing really, even though it has a weightage of 40% in the overall CPI basket has remained quite muted. It's been running in negative for most of the year and it's turned for the... That just can't be real. Come on, I mean, this story that we have, Dubai's $73,000 villa rentals, up 26% on the year, apartment rents up 27%. I mean, is this why they didn't want to print the CPI numbers? I mean, this is going to have a monster impact, isn't it? What we have seen in the past is that whatever you see reflected in the market in terms of housing rental prices, it usually shows up with a lag on the main index. Yes. So there is a certain lag, you will see that appeared on the index eventually, but by then I would expect that things would have come down because you have so much of supply that is standing on the sidelines that will come into the market before end of the year. So eventually the increase that you're seeing currently will have to kind of moderate and so things should come down hopefully soon. By that time you would see it reflected in the CPI as well. Can we extrapolate the argument because in this article by Zena, she uses the data, Zena Fata, of course, it's a great read, it's omplimberg.com, grab it today. The point is the risk, the risk of the economic model and this is what a number of people are saying. This eventually prices out the average family concert, the average young professional. This is what Dubai and the UE are banking their economic future on, which is growth, growth in numbers, population and indeed that white collar, no mad. I mean this begins to act as an economic risk, doesn't it? Maybe turn it down a bit in the sense that there are lots of businesses. You pull me back, no problem. There are lots of businesses that are saying that we need to give a wage hike. I've seen Emirates NBD offered staff around 8% already this year across the board, right? I mean there are businesses that are considering because in such a market you're seeing employees willing to take up other jobs maybe at a higher pay because if you enter the market at a new job you get a relatively higher pay than what you are stuck on at the moment. So there is some sort of wage rise in the picture as well because if you look at the central buying data on wage hikes, there's...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2693,2022-10-14 04:42:02
14468," Because if you look at the central bank data on wage hikes, they are saying that there is a small percentage increase in overall numbers. But you have to understand what the central bank is looking at is ministry of human resources data, which does not include the freezels, where you might have a better number in terms of wage hikes. At least people who are entering the job market at higher rates. OK, look, this is where the discussion comes in. It doesn't accord a million, accord a million, derims for your average villa. It's a pretty tough old, old, old, old, old, ask. And that's why I put it out there as being, you know, it can be the straw that breaks the, it can be the straw that breaks, you know, the camel's back. Not yet. Not yet. Think of it in terms of Dubai is relatively a small place, but then you have downtown Dubai and you also have the outskirts where you're thinking of say Dubai exposity, which has come up recently. If you move towards that side, the rentals are not as high as they are talking of in the central areas. OK, so people always have the option to kind of, you know, migrate and that's what a free market is about. Let's talk about Saudi Arabia because of course, there we've got inflation at 15 month high. We've just seen the kingdom cut. Not just the kingdom, but OPEC plus can't global production by 2%. There's a political battle. First of all, due to the inflation side of the 15 month high in Saudi Arabia. Does it go incrementally higher from here? For now, the Saudi inflation rates have been driven by food and food and beverage prices. We see that will stay high because given what's happening across the globe, it's something that will be reflected in the Saudi market. But there are price controls in place in Saudi, which means that it's not going to rise to the level of what you've seen in the US or the UK. So it will be a relatively lower increase, but an increase never the less. So we're looking at around say 2.6 to 0.7% inflation for the full year in Saudi Arabia. Now, oil is down 4% this week and the political sparring is continuing between the White House in terms of, you know, did you ask Saudi for a cut? Saudi put it in it out there about the growth levels, that that's what they're worried about. That's the flyover cover that Saudi Arabia is using for validating the cut in oil production. The IEA has cut their demand outlook by 20% for next year to 470,000. Of course China could come back online and this could be the spoiler on this. But this kind of look from the IEA, they say oil prices are the tipping point for the global economy. Play oil prices for me into your thinking. Everybody's talking to me about $100 oil as a consensus level. Is that the level for you? I think it is going to remain high for some time at least. Still we get a greater visibility on what's going to happen in China because I think China is the key point that you need to be concerned about. Because you are seeing inflationary pressure, you are seeing monetary tightening across the board, across most of the countries globally. So the question remains how fast is China going to recover? Are they going to stick to their COVID-19 restrictions, quarantines and so on? Or are they eventually going to phase it out? It remains to be seen. That's the biggest question. Well actually she says this weekend on Sunday because that could be the interesting part from the product side for oil and indeed for overall oil demand. The theory is great as always to have you with me going through the markets. That's the theory. I'm a macroeconomics director at NASA CED Associates.

14469," MUSIC Top-wide economic advisor Brian D's has denied, denied that the U.S. efforts to sway the societies to hold off on oil production cuts was guided by political considerations. He caught up with Jonathan Farrow. We clearly communicated our views to OPEC members that we thought it was shortsighted for them to take the action that they were contemplating and they announced. With respect to the strategic petroleum reserve, this was a calibrated decision to address the real issues in the market. We talked to U.S. industry last winter. We identified that there was about a million barrel a day gap between what they were producing this winter and what they said that they could get production to buy late this fall. That million barrel gap was what we calibrated to make the decision on the use of the strategic petroleum reserve and people should feel confident that the strategic petroleum reserve continues to be an asset that we can deploy to address our economic and national security needs. That's always what has dictated the president's decision making on this and that's what dictates his decision making on this going forward. Brian, you didn't answer the question so I'm going to ask it again. I'm going to share with you and share with our audience the quote from the Saudis this morning. The government of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia would like to clarify the based on its belief and the importance of dialogue and exchange of views with its allies and partners outside of OPEC+. Regarding the situation in the oil markets, the government of the kingdom clarified through its continuous consultation with the U.S. administration that all economic analyses indicate the postponing the OPEC plus decision for a month according to what has been suggested would have had negative economic consequences. Brian, again, it's a really straight question. Did you ask the Saudis to delay that decision for a month? Are they telling the truth or not? Look, I'm not going to get on air and disclose private conversations that members have had. But it's not private, it's not the opportunity to say it's true or not. Is it true or not? What I will say clearly is that the communications that we've had with OPEC members and continuing have been based on our assessment of the economic circumstances of supply and demand in global oil markets. I agree with the assessment in that statement that it was economically the right or necessary or appropriate thing to do to reduce production at a time where the lack of global supply on the market continues to be the predominant challenge in global energy markets. That has been and continues to be the motivation behind all of our engagements in our nation. Again, that suggests that it's a political one. That your strategy is political. That your reference to the energy process is what I'm saying to you is that our strategy, I understand what they are suggesting and what I'm saying to you is that our strategy has always been grounded in an assessment of the economics of the situation and what is prudent for the global economy, for US economy and US families. There you go, grounded in economics, not politics. It's getting messy between ReAD and Washington. Let's get back to the Middle East markets now. On the equity side, Farah Al-Brahih is with me as ever. But we're starting on the earnings truck, what did we get? Well we had Jury or Marketing. That's a big discretionary name in Saudi Arabia, man. Our profit missed estimates due to a decline in margins or other weaker margins than expected.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2695,2022-10-14 04:51:05
14470," That's a big discretionary name in Saudi Arabia, man, is their profit and mis-estimates due to a decline in margins or rather weaker margins than expected. And SNV capital, they think that this is the biggest concerns. Of course, the margins squeeze for companies all around the world is the key concern for investors globally. And we're seeing that starting to trickle. And some of the names were didn't increase in profit. So that again, goes back to that discussion we were having yesterday, due to the peg in our currencies, to the dollar. And the fact that our central banks have to follow the Fedor Reserve, it might help banks a little bit in the region, especially the ones that haven't priced in in Rally as big as, say, Saudi Arabia. And what's the latest on the IPO? Development for Saudi Arabia. We caught up yesterday. We had a new one on the block. What more can you tell me? Yeah, we have even more from yesterday. If you can imagine, we reported that a company called 2P, which is an information technology company in Saudi Arabia, seeking evaluation of $1 billion in a listing on the Tadal will in November. And they're looking to sell about 30% of the company to the market. We've seen really high demand, for example, in Manafa, which yesterday, again, we reported that its IPOs over-subscribed at the top end of the range. That's an IPO of about $900 million. That's a big one. It's a utility play, similar to what we saw at the Aqua Power. So we'll see how that one performs when it debuts. Indeed. And then here in the UAE, of course, you and I were chatting about what will come next. Well, what are the developments on the IPO slate for us in the UAE? Yeah, we have Talim, which is a company that's a private school operator. They're seeking a $250 million IPO, Bloomberg reported that yesterday. And the company had already disclosed that it's looking to come to the market. And apparently, again, the listing will take place in November. So you were asking yesterday about listings in Dubai, and so this is one coming for you very soon. And then we also had Roy Thur's report that Lulu, which is a supermarket chain operator, they hired more or less than co for their listing. And Bloomberg earlier reported that they're looking for a 2023 listing. And that would that be. Farah, thank you so much Farah, I'll be right here there. In Dubai, with the values on the equity market slate, plenty more ahead on Debugment, at least. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close?

14471," MUSIC Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on 31st October, as I said earlier in the week, and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. Of course, you're quite dying speaking yesterday, but the UK Chancellor then cut short his trip to the US and had a bank to London to continue the work on the government's long-term fiscal plan, which many debate is somewhat lacking. Lizzie Burton is outside the bank of England. Lizzie, I mean, we're just trying to decide what the iteration is, but that hoist behind you, the Bank of England. I mean, it really is Andrew Bailey, as we come to Friday, has called the bluff of number 10, a number 11 dining street, and it would appear, it would appear Bailey's bluff has won. He's played an absolute blinder, man. Remember, Quartang has said that if the market turmoil continued beyond today, the deadline for the emergency bond buying programme, which Andrew Bailey had staked his credibility on that deadline, then it would be Andrew, but a matter for the governor, Andrew Bailey's fault, essentially. But now it looks like Quartang is going to have to you turn on the corporation tax freeze, which was a central plank of Truss's economic strategy to boost growth. It's hugely humiliating. And now we hear that Quartang has had to rush back from the IMF meeting in Washington to deal with this situation. And really, it's smacks of 2011 when the Greek finance minister had to come back from the G20 to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. Of course, Quartang's allies are shunning that comparison. But really, it seems like finally, Quartang is going to have to listen to financial markets. You heard from the former BoE governor Mark Carney in Washington yesterday saying that markets will punish policy errors. Now the question really is how much more of Liz Truss's budget can actually survive. Yeah, but I love the drama of this because in the end of the day, this is about a Machavelli move by Liz Truss to literally gut her chance to lose policy in absentia. So the debate, the BoEkes will have a number on Quartang surviving, but can Truss survive. Do you think she did enough with the back bench, the 1922 committee, those people, the dark suits in the background? Do you think she's done enough to survive herself? Well, remember, the conservative party is the most successful political party for a reason because it can shed its skin like a snake to stay in power. It wouldn't take much to change its rules to be able to change leader, but whoever would be the next leader would have an even more diluted mandate than Liz Truss, and it would almost certainly force a snap election still though. The times, the financial times are reporting that there are plots behind the scenes to replace Truss with Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordent. Well, there you go. Another battle line is drawn. We'll see you in just under 10 minutes. Don't go away. Don't go and get a coffee. You've got more work to do. We'll get together in about 10 minutes. Lizzy Bird and I side the bank of England.

14472," Welle Apples the link, it's next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy stage manager multitasking interface and an order to link the launch closer to the more similar Mac OS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the App Store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14.

We did see some pressure on the U.N. We did see some pressure on the future. That is now being reversed. This is Bloomberg Daybreak here up. I'm Danny Burger in London, alongside Managed Cranny in Dubai with the stories that set your agenda. Another hot month US inflation hits a fresh 40 year high, Orba Garentine, a jumbo raid hike next month by the Fed. Record reversal. The S&P 500 swings from a 2.4% loss to close 2.6% high. Touching market burs who sold in the wake of yesterday's CPI report. Plus UK tax. You turn. Prime Minister Liz Truss prepares to abandon key measures of her economic agenda, following weeks of market turmoil. Jansana Quattitaing races back from Washington, vying to press ahead with his strategy. Our position hasn't changed.

What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. We see how long they both survive. Never mind Quattitaing on a flight back from New York. Danny, what a monster, monster, monster day. The burs got torched. It wasn't supposed to go this way.

14473," to go this way. I mean, the biggest swings on the hottest CPI print since 1982, you know the fast factor of the day. It was the eye of the tiger and it was in the Rocky movie. That's what was charting top of the charts when inflation was this hot. Always an important fun fact to have. It's another edition of daybreak karaoke. But man, I love so what we're looking at here is the intraday swing. It went from down 2.4% at the open to up 2.6%. That means it was as much as five and a half percent that we saw. And if you look at that chart where other swings happen, man, it's it is during times of tension. It is during bear markets. I love how Lizzie and Saunders puts it. It's the nature of the beast these days. Yeah, but then our guest yesterday from Sean felt said, look, these markets are so short. It's hard to put new short positions on this was a sell everything to buy everything moment and we got a bear in mind. I mean, this is the whip around frenzy that you had yesterday, the reverse of the biggest reversal by the way, since 1990 Jamie Dimon calls a soft landing unlikely and he reckons there could be another 20% on the dying side from here to $6 trillion of losses. It's still trading, Danny, at 17.3 times earnings. But wow, what a whippy day. Yeah, remarkable to see a turnaround like that at the same time, a market is pricing in more than 75 basis points worth of hikes and manness. Let me tell you the market, it is still up today. Equities are still charting higher. I don't know, blame shorts getting crushed blame puts blame the algos blame whatever you want, but the fact of the matter is S&P and as that futures are both up half a percent again, this morning, man, is your stock 50 futures, those up 1.8% of course, that monster rally, the continuation of it happened when Europe was closed. So that needs to catch up and manness Asia also strong this morning to the MSCA Asia Pacific up more than 2.5%. Yeah, Juliet Sally wants to know whether I'd pump my whole salary into the neck. But I bet her that because what I center was by the end of this day, you're going to get monster notes from huge hises talking about 100 basis point hikes. The Fed is going to have to move from talking to talk to walking the walk and that's transferred into the bond market and explosion into your rates up 24 basis points in the trading session. Yes, let's have a look at cross assets. You look at some reprieve this morning on the top level in the two year notes on the back of that hot print. We're opening up Pandora's box to 100 basis point hikes, certainly 75 in this month and in December cable managed to run up by over 2% yesterday. It was one of the biggest one day gains since March 2020. Will the Maccabelli moves from number 10 to got the budget of quasi court time mean that we're going to see further momentum on the upside and reprieve in sterling. Now I'm excrued up to 10 of 1% 89 90 as the IEA says the moves in the oil market from OPEC plus are enough to push a tipping point on the global economy. So big risk there and of course a 30 year low on dollar yen. Danny. Man, I think I want to take I want to take the other side of your bet. I'm going to say we're going to get no 100 basis point calls for many big banking houses. I feel like I'm going to lose that one, but I want to take all of that. I leave you there with that walk. Makes a market right. All right. Well, let's get to the reporters from around the world before I lose all of my money and a bet to man. This end occurrence going to help us digest the latest CPI print. Well, David Finnerty is on hand to unpack unpack the market reaction. Lizzie, of course, is outside of Threde Needle Street with the latest drama number 10 in the B.O.E. Let's get to Juliet Sally. She's salivating to the thought of that salary. Mine got into the nick a jewels. How you doing? How your market moves? Will they endure? I'm good, Matt. But I think you got to end up before me. I'll come back a little later and give you those. She's not ready for you yet, man. Let's go to the Fed, shall we? She's not ready. I'm just miss reading. I'm too excited to spread the feds in focus. Are they going to dial? You know, where are they in terms of dialing back to the aggressive rate hikes that could be delayed again? You got the hotter than expected CPI print as we've been saying at 6.6% for the year in September and present by acknowledging those more to do to combat price rises.

14474," to combat price rises. Americans are squeezed by the cost of living. It's been true for years and folks don't need to be to report to tell them they're being squeezed. Fighting this battle every day is the key reason why I ran for President of the United States. And Karen is standing by. So that's the voice from the White House and talk us through why you think there's two clips of 75 to come before the end of the year. Yeah, so this was meant to be the time of year, Manus when the Fed was slowing up in its rate hikes. Maybe even pivoting from it, but obviously inflation continues to head in completely the wrong direction. Those numbers overnight showing cornflation as you mentioned at a 40 or a high 6.6 percent. Headline inflation still over 8 percent. Way outside the Fed's 2 percent target. Looking under the hood, you see price pressures across the board. Food prices up by 11 percent. So we're seeing that US inflation is becoming more broad based now and perhaps proving to be stickier than expected. And of course, all of that means that a, at the very least the Fed will probably go by 75 in November. But to your point there will probably be debate over whether they go by a larger amount. But now there's also a view that high on a second December, which was meant to be the month of when they did pull back a little bit. Well, that looks like now another 75 base points move at least if not something bigger too. All of this is pushed to Fed debate into new territory. It's raising the spectra of an even more aggressive US hiking cycle than anticipated. And of course that won't just have consequences for the US economy. It will spill over to the rest of the world too. And a little birdie also told me that you want to one up our, which was top of the charts at 1982. You got the movie for us. Tell us what was the movie that was most popular 40 years ago? I mean, I know my place, Danny. I'm here. I humbly mentioned that ET was in the movies in 1982, but obviously, obviously I'd refer to it to fair to madness. But it does drive on the scale of the problem. You're the chief economist. You're the chief economist. You can I bid me, buddy. Don't worry. There's space in this show. OK, OK. I'm going to, I'm going to, let me just change the topic. Let me save us both. We'll not change the topic. Let's stay with inflation. But of course, we've got China's numbers and a totally different story. Completely different story. Consumer prices quite subdued. And that's all about the ongoing COVID restrictions, dampening consumer appetite, producer prices as well, by the way, sliding below 1%. So there's no inflation story in China. If anything, people learn how to more concern there about stiflation, give them where the economy is headed. We have the all-important party congress this weekend. Will this signal a pivot on, on COVID-0? Will this signal a pivot on the economy? All of that is crucial. But for now, at least right here right now, no inflation story in China and completely the opposite direction to the US. And thank you very much. End of current with the data and the fast facts in Hong Kong. Now, Treasury yields jumped off the back of that hot CPI reading. The policy-sensitive two-year rate is hitting its highest level since 2007. Or rather, did hit that highest level before pairing the rise? For more, let's get to Bloomberg's. David Finnerty, David, the bond vigilantes, they continue to move these markets around. But are they sustainable? Yeah, I think certainly in the near term, they are. One of the key things today is going to be the two that you, the University of Michigan, are fired to tenure in inflation expectations. They're supposed to uptick. If it be, and again, if it beats expectations, then there'll be certainly worries that inflation is getting embedded into people's attitudes, which is one thing the Fed doesn't want. So we'll add to that hawkish rhetoric. You've got more Fed speakers. In fact, you have a slew of Fed speakers over the upcoming week. But today, you have Esther George and Lisa Cook. They're more likely hawkish, so we're going to keep that drum beat going. And of course, we have the PCE data due at the end of the month. And again, we know the Fed looks at that. And if that comes in aggressive, then you've got another case for us. The ender was indicating a 75-75 basis point. That's all going to help you, you're a shield. And then also the market will start thinking, well, we're predicting the rate cut next year. Are we actually getting ahead of the curve too much? Will we be a rate cut? Because the Fed has continued to say, there is no rate cut. And the message hasn't changed. And if a data keeps backing that up, I think the vision market will have to revise what it's expecting. And that will support your shields and push them higher. Well, certainly there's a move in that terminal rate. Isn't there David to the upside? And Jamie Dheimen talking about 4.5%. No. David Kennedy there with the very latest on the bond markets. And what was a stunning...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2700,2022-10-14 05:12:43
14475," Speculation again about intervention and when you look at the futures volume spiking here there is a lot of trade-as-suggestions that there has been some intervention. Of course, so far it's only been verbally we heard again from the finance minister Suzuki. But the Yen are ready trading weaker than those levels when we saw the intervention around $20 billion into the market in September. So a lot of focus on what we're going to see next. But the main thing to look at too is the volatility here, Madison. When you look at dollar Yen volatility it's quite tame compared to where it was when we saw that intervention in September. Manus. Yeah, the debate rose on doesn't it Jules? Whether verbal intervention on a little bit of action is really enough to stop the monster move. It may take something more. Jules, the best was of course at the last there. To come on the show pivot hopes sedashed US core inflation rose by more than forecast to 40 year high in September, likely to secure another big fed rate hike. More on the story, Danny. Manus, you want to pivot. I'll give you a pivot. The lady is for turning. We're also going to discuss UK Prime Minister scrapping the key tax cuts as her chancellor rushes back to the UK. We'll talk you turn. This is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy. When it comes to family generations that the first generation creates the second generation expands in the third generation destroys and that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, Hating and Love. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they say you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. Gucci is really teetering on the brink at this stage. I don't know if it could be a soft landing. I don't think so but it might mild recession or tough recession. My point is in the tough recession. Yeah, you expect the market to end up 20 to 30 percent. I'm not going to keep eyes on across those three things but for all of us who have to worry about risk. Of course you should plan for those things. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon signed in the pessimistic note that Danny above the US's chance of avoiding a recession and that's the debate really isn't it? Yeah and the debate is fueling just insane volatility in this market. So let's stop to someone who's been navigating it. It's Dan Zorn CEO and CIO of the $3.6 billion global investment firm arena investors. Dan, hope you had a lot of coffee this week. It's been a wild one. So what have you done? Where have you found opportunities? How have you been moving around the sidelines of just this market and sanity? Sure. Well, we've been very busy. I think in this market there's a combination of what I would call it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2701,2022-10-14 05:19:40
14476," on opportunities, how have you been moving around the sidelines of just this market insanity? Sure. Well, we've been very busy. I think in this market, there's a combination of what I would call tactical opportunities, opportunities where we're really running toward and those that we expect to come. In the case of tactical opportunities, things like convertible bonds where institutional investors have been big sellers while at the same time, retail investors have held onto the stocks, creating distortions of value that present arbitrage. In the second case, in terms of more opportunity to focus, the entire world of kind of growth, equity, and venture capital has is in the middle of great, great changes and that provides new opportunities for kind of what I would call growth credit, providing forms of rescue finance in those situations that are very compelling. At the same time, there's a tremendous misbalance or imbalance among institutional allocators in terms of having been over invested in various forms of LP interests and so there's a kind of very large amount of that stuff coming along with regard to things that are coming along in the future. Really leverage finance, ABS mortgages are only starting to see the cracks but we're going to see tremendous opportunities there. Yeah, man, let's jump in here. Yeah, let's let's unpack some of that. I like your line, Dan. Good morning to you in terms of the redefining of where we are with growth equity to growth credit. I mean, if we look at what Apollo's saying, they're pinching themselves in regards to the opportunities in credit. So where in growth credit are you putting the most amount of money to work or where are you researching the most? Well, you know, I think we've had for the last, you know, 14 years of tremendous bull market in growth and so a lot of that has fueled the development of businesses that really have no prospects of actually creating EBIT. However, a very large number of them are very good businesses that if it have basically sacrificed profitability in order to drive revenue growth in order to drive successive rounds of ever growing pre and post money valuations. A number of those businesses are retrenching for good businesses but they need to cut off X and HR expense in order to kind of revert toward profitability and many of them are willing to basically pay very, very high rates in order to in order to avoid what otherwise would be a tremendously painful down-round on a go-forward basis. So it's really lies at the confluence of what's traditionally been known as venture lending, what is currently known as direct lending and what we would call the stress or special situations investing. I do wonder in terms of the cracks in those private markets because folks are continued to pile money into private capital, be it credit, be it equity, be it whatever because of this idea that it's not marked to market. Therefore, it doesn't look as ugly as current public markets look like. But considering your finding opportunities here are the cracks starting to merge and when they do finally emerge, how ugly does it get for some of these private sectors? Well, you're right. People don't frequently don't recognize losses until the nav statement shows up. Interestingly, you know, about a year ago when large scale endowments were up 40, 50, 60 percent, your alma mater University of Virginia said something to the effect of, you know, things are good but we're kind of watchful. Yeah, you know how to pander to me this perfectly. But and actually the head of Harvard's endowment kind of said the same thing which is yes, the numbers are what they are here but we expect some changes. Many others have not. Many others have said, well, my liquid fixed income and equities are down but good news, my very same assets that are basically bound in private packages without marked a market are somehow up. That's not possible. And so what that means is there's this tremendous disinclination to recognize reality and we see that not only among allocators at many times but also among the large scale participants in leverage finance ABS and mortgages. So it's going to take some time because ultimately there's a positive cash flow there. So that allows you to kind of duck and dodge and and and move around to try to avoid the reality of really paying the bill. Well, somebody's got to pay the bill in the end anyway and it's interesting when you when you're talking about marked a market, you know, in 1994 if you had a lot of put options written on bond option strategies to yield and hence you got caught with your trousers down when you had to move from marked a market and liquidate and that is what is happening now. People are being forced into closing out positions. But let's pivot to Europe. We don't spend enough time talking about Europe on this show ironically. We're so macro obsessed with the United States of America. Abu Dhabi's Royal Group are about to deploy $10 billion from here into there. Well, more Europe than there. And what are we not talking about in Europe that we should be talking about in terms of opportunities? We can stay in crisis mode for the rest of our lives if we want.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2702,2022-10-14 05:24:26
14477," into there, but more Europe than there. What are we not talking about in Europe that we should be talking about in terms of opportunities? We can stay in crisis mode for the rest of our lives if we want to, where are the opportunities? Well, we're pursuing various forms of special situation and distress that are in property throughout Southern Europe. A lot of that is really still hangover from the GFC originally, but there's also tremendous opportunities arising as the CRE markets start to adjust to the realities of a post-COVID world. We're also looking at the notion of various forms of subprime finance. Europe has been incredibly slow to enable subprime customers to access finance despite the great growth in subprime customers. There's also a very large opportunity and kind of completely uncorrelated investments in things like litigation, finance, and royalties and things of that sort. And then finally, on the public markets, there's quite a bit of opportunity in various forms of kind of private convertible issuances and things of that sort. So lots to do and even more coming as a lot of this kind of regular way direct lending and leverage finance starts to crack as well throughout Europe. In terms of sort of dipping toes back into IG bonds, I mean, they're headed for their worst year on record. And also, Shemami, Manus, it's just saying let's get away from the US and I'm going back into the US. So I'm sorry, Manus. Anyway, so IG, look, set for the worst year on record in terms of losses, but a pretty juicy yield at this moment. At what point is it attractive enough to jump in, again, despite the losses we've seen? Well, when you say jump in, the notion is, what do I have to fear if I jump in? Well, what I have to fear is being around long enough for, to be short puts that emerge. So what I would argue to you is that there's tremendous opportunities in investment grade debt that's really in the kind of next 24 to 36 months. Great companies, great projects, great opportunities in situations where the duration's not going to kill you. That's certainly an opportunity. And you're seeing mid-high single digit yields and some of that stuff that really makes a lot of sense. A lot of people use the word things are going to break, things are breaking, what's breaking. Then many people count to that and they say, it's not 2008, it's not a Lehman's like moment. And yet, I've just come back from a trip from Turkey and people are talking about a multitude of factors coming to play. F-contightening, higher rates, single events, it's not a Lehman individual moment that we're facing, but a confluence of war, energy crisis, F-contightening, it is this confluence of everything. What's the top alert for you? Well, I would agree it's not a Lehman moment per se. It's a 1970s moment and the moment is going to be a lot longer than a moment. We have a combination of really a responsible monetary policy that occurred since the QE2 in 2012 and it's going to take an enormous number of rate rises to start to kind of deal with that. At the same time, particularly since 2020, you have government spending that's literally out of control across most of the Western democracies. Whenever you've seen that, you've seen very significant inflation. And whenever you've seen a significant inflation, you're going to see things like panic and stagnation and other kind of more difficult things that take a long time to work out. Well, we're certainly in panic mode, aren't we? Dan Swen, CEO and CIO of Arena investors. Our guest this morning on the market's great conversation coming up through the day. We're getting here from top policy makers, including the IMF's Gita Gopinath, the German Finance Minister Christian Linda. And the governor of the Bank of Portugal, Mario Centeno, along with Deutsche Bank's, Deutsche Bundesbank's president, Joachim Nagel, right here on Lümbag.INTRO There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs.

14478," There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and not just in government research labs. There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion. They can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. It's your Friday edition of Daybreak You're with me, Manuscranian, DeBio and Danny Berger in London with the stories that set your agenda. Another hot month U.S. inflation hits a 40-year high all but guaranteeing a jumbo rate hike next month by the Fed.

14479," Closed 2.6% higher, torching market bears who sold in the wake of yesterday's CPI report. Plus, UK tax, U-turn, Prime Minister Liz Truss prepares to abandon key measures of her economic agenda following weeks of market turmoil. Chancellor Quasicortang races back from Washington, bowing to press ahead with his strategy. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the Medium-Term Fiscal Plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week and there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. So Danny, the consequences of that potentially U-turn from number... Oh, well, turning, number 10, turning on number 11, had sterling all of a flurry. Have a look at this, cross assets sterling up biggest one day, Moose in March 2020. You're looking at the bond, markets up 24 basis points in the space of one day, giving it a little bit back. That's on the hottest CPI since 1982 on the call. And of course, you had the whip around rally in the stock, you'll take us through that. But you're looking at dollar yen, spectacular. At mini intervention, we'll get more from jewels on that, but dollar yen at a 30-year low. Nothing can stop the rot in dollar yen. Danny. Yeah, I mean, as by one measure yesterday, was the biggest whip saw the biggest turn around in U.S. equities since the data started in 1990. But it doesn't end there, the gains continue today up more than half a percent for S&P 500 futures, Nasdaq, similar climbs, even bigger climbs for Euro, stocks 50 futures, which need to play a little bit of catch up with the U.S. and Manus. I mean, look at this turn around in H.S. Tech. It has been getting crushed because of that chip story. It was up 5% just moments ago, but still nearly up that much at this point. All right, Manus, let's go back to the banking story. Not necessarily the U.S. banking story. We'll get there shortly, but it is all about credit suites. Every day, I feel like we're getting a new story about what assets are up for sale and who might be interested. Exactly. And I think it's a question of the quality of the interest. The red headline, the Bloomberg scoop, Mizzouho, are going to step into the fray here. And this is, of course, on the Securitized Products Business. This is your world, Danny. Securitized Products Business. You got Apollo, center bridge, PIMCO, and six streets. So this might be just such a big far sale of a credit suites assets because it's got value. Yeah. Yeah, look, this is the kind of portfolio that a lot of these managers want to beef up. You're right. It is my world. You know what else is my world, Manus, which is potentially worrying for some of the U.S. banks and asset management divisions is BlackRock. They reported assets that tumbled 16%. Yes, they did have inflows, but that also missed estimates might be a little bit of a nervous news coming for the asset managers out there, given the damage we've seen in these markets. Indeed, well, let's let's let's carry on that conversation on the banks because of course, it is the owning season. Third quarter numbers are going to hit the tape. And what can we expect when those report, the financial results hit today? We've got City Group, City Group, JP Morgan. They're the giants that report today, the set of earnings, and it looks heavily scrutinized as close to the direction of where we go towards the end of the year. Let's take it to Walter Todd CIO for Greenwood Capital. Here we are. The NIMS is what has it in theory, but we're going to have not such a soft landing according to Jamie Diamond. Talked me through the net interest income and how important that is and where we are with Wall Street's banks. Walter, good morning. Yeah, good early morning from the US here. Yeah, there's going to be, as you mentioned, a couple of dynamics at play here with the bank earnings on the one hand. As you mentioned, net interest margin and traditional banking business of taking into deposits and lending those out is going to be really strong because interest rates and the Fed have moved much more aggressively than a lot of people anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, and you have banks that hadn't really had to raise their deposit rate yet. So that spread is going to be really significant. So...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2705,2022-10-14 05:37:19
14480," than a lot of people anticipated at the beginning of the year. And so, and you have banks that hadn't really had to raise their deposit rate yet, so that spread is going to be really significant. So we're going to see big beats, I believe, on that metric for a lot of these banks. On the other hand, everything outside of that traditional business is kind of in the tank right now. You look at housing and the mortgage market, that's at a standstill. You look at deal-making and investment banking. That's down significantly. And you mentioned the wealth management with BlackRock. If you have that component, if you're a major money center bank, if that's down as well. So, which one kind of wins the day? I think we'll wait and see. But we do have the fact that banks, at least certainly some of the bigger banks like JP Morgan, are down significantly into these earnings numbers. And so valuations are much more attractive than they were six to nine months ago. Can I add another potentially negative story in here, Walter, which I'm sure no one needs at this moment. But Manus mentioned it. We had Jamie Dimon talking about the fact that a soft landing is unlikely. Translate that into me, for me, into what we're likely to see in terms of low-lost provisions at JP Morgan, at Bank of America. What is that going to look like if we have executives talking about a fearful outlook for the U.S. economy? Yeah, that's a great point, Danny. And one of the things that banks benefited so much from in 2021 was the release of those loan reserves that they took during the height of COVID that is certainly eased. And so that could be a big swing factor in these quarterly reports in terms of those. I mean, when you think about, for example, what's happening with this Twitter deal and Tesla buying them and having to try to shop that loan, that financing right now, there's reports that they're going to take significant losses. A lot of banks are going to take significant losses on that. So what are the other kind of things that are hitting under rocks that are going to happen and potentially in the future as the economy slows down? So that is a risk. And I think that's one of the reasons that banks in general have not done that well. However, they were, you know, financials in general were the best performing sector yesterday. And they've started to improve incrementally here over the past couple of weeks. So, Walter, I'm interested to get your view. A lot of people have lampooned me when I've sort of held up and cried at the TV screen, 7% from mortgage in the United States of America. And people heard things back at me and they say, oh, you don't understand the American mortgage market. I do. It's based on remorgaging, refinancing every two years to propagate your overall net worth. 7% matters, doesn't it, in terms of mortgage rates in the United States of America going forward? 6.92 is where we hit over the last week, the highest in 20 years, extrapolate at 20 year high and mortgage rates for me. The risk, the reward. Yeah, well, the risk is that the housing market is totally, you know, I don't want to say frozen necessarily, but I mean, the activity level has dropped precipitously because of that rate increase. I mean, we were at 3% on that metric at the beginning of the year. So just, you know, 10 months ago, and now we're over 7% and what that calculates into in terms of a mortgage payment. So prices are going to have to come down to reflect that change in interest rates as we move forward. And this is one of the... Housing crash, 7% mortgage rates, housing crash, or just a mini drop. Well, you know, real estate is local. And so I think in parts of the country, you're going to see pretty significant price declines where you saw the most increases around the country. So, yeah, I think that activity level is slowing and is going to continue to slow. And this is one of the things that, you know, we wish the Fed instead of looking at the CPI and the owners equivalent rent, which is, you know, no one pays. And look at the data that we're seeing today, which is rents are starting to come down. Housing prices are starting to fall. The latest Schiller data on a month over month basis was actually down for the first time in over a decade on the prices. So prices are coming down. It's... Are you describing the Fed about to overdo it if they go 75, if they go per manus and manus bet? They start to... We start to hear more chatter of 100. Is that the Fed overdoing it? Well, yeah, potentially, I mean, I think the market's kind of telling them that look at the 210 curve right now, negative 50 basis points. The, you know, the most negative has been over 20 years. So you look at the one year four break evens there at two and a half percent. They were over six, nine months ago. So the market is trying to tell the Fed, I believe that you've done enough. Let's just, you know, wait this thing out. Of course.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2706,2022-10-14 05:41:46
14481," the market is trying to tell the Fed, I believe that you've done enough. Let's just, you know, wait this thing out. Of course they're not going to do that. They're going to raise another 75 as you said, another 75 likely in December as well as what the markets anticipating. So I think that risk is definitely increasing as we move forward. So in the meantime, we get these days of extreme volatility, right? Manus, Manus, I mean, we talked about it this morning. Didn't we that we have these swings the most since 1990? Yeah, you know, you have the story of iPhones accidentally calling emergency services while people are on rollercoasters and I'm surprised traders, phones haven't done the same thing with this volatility. I mean, 200 points swing from the lows yesterday to where we're indicated this morning with the future. So we ran out of sellers yesterday and that's a good thing. And I think there's probably some follow through to this given the magnitude of that reversal from just from a pure technical standpoint, but nothing, you know, fundamentally has changed. And so we're still going to have to see the earnings come in. But I do think the expectations are very low for a lot of these companies reporting. So perhaps we can see a better than feared type of reporting season like we saw in the second quarter as well. Still feels like the rollercoaster is going to continue, even if it's on the upswing Walter, we are strapping in tight here. Walter Todd there, CIO at Greenwood Capitol. Thanks so much for joining us. Thanks for staying up through the night for us there in South Carolina. All right, let's take a look at some of the key things that we're going to be watching out for today. And just under an hour, we get UK home prices could give us clues as to how fragile the UK economy is considering these extreme swings we've seen in rates. 130 PM US retail sales data comes, which will of course show the impact of inflation and fed hikes on the US consumer, speaking of which we're going to get the all closely watch you, Mitch, consumer sentiment and business inventory data. And later today, the BOE's Emerging Bond buying program is set to end and during the day, managed. We're going to hear from a slew of ECB speakers, Holtzman and also the feds Esther George. Okay, we're coming up the U turn. If you want to, this trust is reportedly preparing to abandon central part of her tax cut plan, her plan or court tanks plan. We're bringing the details on Bloomberg. A digital first approach to the future work is where the industry and all companies will be heading. We're going to be moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with computers with our bodies. This is definitely trippy. We're going to be moving into a world where we're going to be interacting with our bodies. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2707,2022-10-14 05:45:31
14482," MUSIC Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week. And there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. It's fine, because it's not the chance of the United Kingdom. Despite that, the UK Chancellor reports suggestions our Prime Minister, Liz Truss, is preparing to abandon the central part of her tax cut in agenda after weeks of chaos in markets. Dani, Bayley's bluff seems to have worked. It does seem to have worked at least for now. Let's dive into the story deeper Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton is outside the B.O.E. Lizzy. What was the turning point? Well, between the clip you just played, and then in the evening, when Quarting was asked whether the corporation tax freeze would be the next U-turn, and he said, let's see to the telegraph at the IMF meeting in Washington what changed was that markets priced this U-turn in, and it's made it seem almost inevitable. Because, of course, earlier in the week, Liz Truss said that she wasn't going to cut public spending, so it leaves only U-turns on tax cuts as the means to find this £60 billion she needs to plug the whole in the public finances and restore credibility in markets. So Quarting is on his way back from Washington. It seems to the UK. It's a smacks of 2011 when the Greek finance minister had to leave the G20 to deal with the sovereign debt crisis. Quarting, of course, batting away those comparisons his allies at least. But really, perhaps this is the moment when Quarting realises he cannot ignore financial markets. Mark Carney, the former B.O.E. Governor, said at the IMF yesterday that they will punish bad policy. You have to ask now how much of the rest of Trussonomics can survive this pressure? What is it that the debate has been between this government acting with arrogance or ignorance, but it certainly has provoked the air of effects and rates traders. But with that in mind, arrogance is always a challenge one could say by markets. And the Bank of England is the last day. They're shutting up shop behind you. They won't be that busy buying gilts later on today. So will Bailey extend the bond buying programme? That's what we need to debate. Well, in terms of this game of chicken between Quarting and Bailey, Bailey has played an absolute blind. Quarting, of course, said that if the market turmoil continued, it would be a matter for the governor. And Bailey staked his credibility on today being the deadline for the programme. So given that Quarting is the one making the U-turn, it seems Bailey has won in this game. However, if the market turmoil does continue after today, what I'm hearing is that perhaps we could get a creative more targeted solution. That's what former Biden-Coffingham policymaker Martin will told me he would do yesterday with perhaps more targeted support for pension funds. But what Andrew Bailey will want to do is not be prioritising financial stability over inflation fighting and not appear to be dancing to the tune of fiscal policy, which is how it would seem if this bond buying continues. Yeah, the backstop of the backstop, Lizzie. Thank you so much, Lizzie, for the bank of England and the fit to just release, Danny, if you look at the money market flows, the plumbing. We've often talked about the plumbing of this system, the fit warns at the guilt market turmoil that we've seen, money market outflow. So you're seeing not just this mass liquidation of risk by the asset managers on the LDI risk, but also turning to money markets, those very stable funds. You know, this is all very reminiscent of another period of time in a-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2708,2022-10-14 05:50:09
14483," on the LDI risk, but also turning to money markets, those very stable funds. You know, this is all very reminiscent of another period of time in my life, but let's not go there. But of course, the money market, I suppose, have surpassed those of March 2020. Yeah, and you know what, always be plug and man, and so I'm just gonna plug it. I wrote a nice little piece on the M-life blog. I won't dive into it here, but it is about this very idea. These pockets were all this debt is, liquidity mismatches, chances for fire sales and life go on your terminal. Indeed. And you sent that to me. Is that on M-library? Where is that? Shameless plug this? Yeah, that's on M-life. Yeah, there we go. There you go. She's shining me. I might have fast facts of the day about what was number one, but she's the intellectual on the show. She writes about fast facts in markets. Let's have a look at the point, because of course we put on over 2.4% yesterday. The question is, now, how quickly do we accelerate from here? If there's a U-turn on the corporate tax study, I mean, we rose the most in two years, up 2.4%. And my question is, you know, is Nemora right? Do we, is this gonna be one of the best opportunities to re-attack a short position in sterling, as opposed to dollar strength? Maybe we should show Euro sterling, because that's still where the consensus is, maybe there's more blood on the street to come for sterling, and then there is for Euro, Donnie. Yeah, well, let me show you the risk in this guilt market, because I mean, it's been, you wanna talk about a U-turn. This market has done a U-turn. I mean, it was up at 5% again at some point, falls really dramatically, but I love the risk that Dan McCullochsky is over at LCP. He's a pension advisor there puts out saying, that this is more than just about the technicals. It's about a demand-peaking story. If this marks the peak in demand of guilt from pensions, who's gonna buy all the guilt's manness? We're gonna get QT at the end of this month, from Andrew Bailey, from the BOE, how much of the guilt market expansion was because of pension buying, and has that evaporated because of this latest turmoil? It just means that again, too many bonds out there, not enough buyers. Well, don't forget, of course, you know, Andrew Bailey was being pilloried in the middle of the week, wasn't he, in terms of his communication, and the chaos from the bank of England, the institution that he leads, the chaos theory that erupted because of him saying one thing, the briefing with the FT. So, to turn around, so Bailey's bluff suddenly won. I think perhaps we all need to be a little bit careful with, you know, let's give an A-star to Bailey, and perhaps a Z-rate into Quartang. Well, I think the market gave a Z-rate into Quartang. It wasn't you and I. So, that debate continues. But where is the next leg in sterling? That is the debate for me. You're right, who's gonna buy these guilt's? What issues do you need to have? Are you gonna need to find tax cuts, Danny, or fiscal, I suppose, savings of 60 billion points? There's your sterling for you, your darn sterling rallying. So, you just see that little bit of a move over the last three days as well. We're gonna talk about the China Communist Party Congress. Yes, yes. There's a big event in China. It's on Sunday, President Xi Jinping expected to secure a record-breaking third term more in the story right here on Blimbug. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations. That is the first generation that creates the second generation expands and the third generation destroys.

Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they strayed you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage.

I'm Danny Burger in London with Manus Cranny and Dubai and Manus and Big Events in China this weekend. Yeah, and it's taking us 53 minutes to get there. That just shows you the shift in tonality and global risks. China's Communist Party Congress begins this weekend. You've got a whole set of challenges facing the leadership there. Don't you? Joining us now is our Chinese government reporter. It's Colin Murphy. Colin, how are you doing? What's he going to say about zero COVID? Good morning. Good evening. Good afternoon. How are you today? I mean, basically we're just coming up to the weekend where everything will start. We're looking to the kickoff of Congress on Sunday. So the tensions are quite high here in Beijing actually. There's a lot of rigid applications of the COVID measures as you can imagine. But as the delegates are coming into town, I think people including the security personnel are all on guard to make sure that there is no major hill. major hiccup in the run-up to the event, which, as I say, kicks off on Sunday. Well, speaking of high tensions, I mean, we've had a, you know, rare protest in Beijing. What do we make of it? Well, it's really striking because, you know, as I just mentioned, there's like so much security, and this is definitely the key event of the last decade, I would say. And for this to happen in such a bold way is really, really surprising. So just to recap, there was somebody on furl two banners on a prominent bridge in the northwest of Beijing yesterday. And that caught a lot of attention. In those banners, they were calling for more democracy, denouncing she's moved to take on the title of People's Leader and so on and so forth. So really, really very unusual. And not surprising, one day later, almost immediately, there's been a massive clampdown on censorship, including some people's access to WeChat, which is, of course, the lifeline of many people here as a messaging app, but also many, many functions, including payment mechanisms. People are getting banned for life from WeChat because of posting either photographs or news related to this event. So it's pretty serious. And, you know, under normal circumstances, maybe this sort of small protest might be put down or not broadcast through social media, but it did get out and it also made it, of course, international media. So it's very, very embarrassing. It's quite an embarrassing moment for the party and she, especially so close to this Congress, which was just two days away. Let's see what the weekend brings. Colin, thank you very much. Our Chinese government reported a column of Murphy in Beijing. Danny, quick snapshot of risk. I love it. Dollar Yens on its knees. And the Nikkei is flying higher.

The question is, do you listen to the King of Wall Street? It records as another 20% on the dying side. We'll leave you with a view of H.S. Tech, Bloomberg markets. Europe is up next. This is Bloomberg. These floating flowers are made of 92,000 solar panels. They can generate 41 megawatts, which is enough to power 20,000 homes. It's one of the biggest floating solar plants in the world. Floating solar rays have been gaining traction in Asia, including countries like Singapore and Thailand. Floating projects typically benefit from an easier connection to the power grid. They can also restrict algae blooms while keeping the solar panels cool. This one in particular has healthy local economy. When the power plant was first proposed, residents were given the chance to invest. Some locals were also offered jobs during construction. In fact, it was the community that requested the panels to be shaped as flowers to look more appealing. South Korea relies heavily on imported fossil fuels, but will need to change that to reach its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Solar plants like this one may help the country reach its net zero goals. It will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. Good morning. Welcome to Bloomberg Market's European Anna Edwards Live in London. The cash trade is just less than an hour away here on your top headlines. UK tax, U-turn, Prime Minister Liz Trance prepares to abandon key measures of her economic plan. Following weeks of market turmoil, Chancellor Quanty Quanting raises back from Washington. Coming in hot, US inflation hits a fresh 40-year high, all but guaranteeing a jumbo rate hike next month by the Fed. The U-turn is a $500-defise expectation, swinging from a more than 2% loss to close 2.6% higher. Hurting market bears who sold in the wake of the CPI report. The rally continues in Asia. Good morning everybody. What a roller coaster it's been once again. We're just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading. Here is the future picture for you. It looks pretty positive here in Europe. And it is instructive to think about how we got here of course.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2711,2022-10-14 06:02:56
14486," We're just under an hour away from the start of cash equity trading. Here is the futures picture for you. It looks pretty positive here in Europe. And it is instructive to think about how we got here, of course. We've seen days of selling and then things turned around. Tempt they so US equity markets were much rosier yesterday, managed to swing from a more than 2% loss, as we said, in our headlines to a 2% game, despite the fact that the CPI number was higher than expected. It led to cemented expectations for another jumbo rate hike coming through from the Fed. So what was it turned things around? Short covering Jamie Dimon's comments about the consumer. Expectations of better banking profits. Who knows, but these are some of the suggestions that are coming through very sensible ones. I'm sure coming through to Bloomberg. And so that is what what we are reporting. This is what we have on Euro stocks 50 features. They're not by 1.7%. European futures looking to play catch up with some of the losses they some of the games. Sorry, they miss out on during yesterday's session. But US futures also positive too. So Eminis up 6.1%. Now stack features up by a half of a percent. So that's the strength we're seeing in the futures picture. Let's have a look at where the GMM takes us because as we said again in our headlines, this strength, this risk on mood carrying on through Asia, we're up by 2.4% on the MSCI Asia Pacific. You see the Japanese market doing well, some of that currency related, perhaps similarly maybe with the Korean market. But we are seeing strength in Asian stocks. The dollar actually through all of this. Well, yesterday we saw big moves. The dollar was dropping as the S&P increased. But today we're pretty flat on the dollar. The yen though is still a little bit weak. You see it there in the GMM down to 10% of a percent. It is still near a new 30 year high. It touched that new 30 year high just after we got that CPI data through from the United States. So intervention anybody that is certainly the question on the minds of FX markets. They're also thinking about where the pound goes next. In what could be a stunning U-turn, Prime Minister Liz Truss is reported to be preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda. After weeks of chaos in the markets, the chancellor has cut short his trip to the United States. And he's heading back to London just hours after insisting he's quote, not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week. And there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. Sicking to his line, sticking to delivering on the mini budget, and saying growth is the priority. And so Bank of England, Governor Andrew Bailey's gamble, ending an emergency bomb buying program today. Well, is that paying off? That's a crucial talking point as well, of course. Joining us now from outside the Bank of England, he's Bloomberg's Lizzy Burton, who is with us. Lizzy goodness me, what has changed then? I mean, we heard from Quasi Quasi, he was saying he's not going anywhere. I assume in reference to his job, rather than his more immediate geographical plans, because he is going somewhere. We know he's on his way back to the UK. A lot has changed. A lot is changing and is expected to change very quickly. Yeah, the crucial turning point yesterday was that the pound and guilt rose on the news that there could be a new turn on cooperation tax. Of course, this is a central plank of trust's economic strategy to boost growth. The idea was to freeze it instead of raising it as Boris Johnson had planned to from 19% to 25%. Perhaps we're going to see a smaller raise to try to show markets that trust, as she has said, is in listening mode. So, Quarting, rushing back from Washington, it has been compared to when the Greek finance minister had to rush back from the G20 in 2011, although Quarting's allies are shunning. That comparison, of course, that was for the sovereign debt crisis. But really, it shows that he has to listen to financial markets. The former BoE Governor Mark Carney at the IMF yesterday said that they will punish bad policy. You have to ask now whether much more of Truss' budget can survive this pressure. Yes, we even had politicians talking about how the markets are in charge now. So, will your outside the bank of England, Lizzie, will, Bailey then extend the Governor Bailey? Will he extend the bond buying programme? Will he, said he won't, of course. And perhaps that's paid off. Perhaps we've seen some changing direction, fiscally, as a result of that. And perhaps we've seen some of the pension funds that it's bringing agendas of panic and first privacy as a counter始.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2712,2022-10-14 06:07:57
14487," That's paid off, perhaps we've seen some changing direction, fiscally, as a result of that. And perhaps we've seen some of the pension funds who needed to bring guilt to the Bank of England, perhaps they're doing that now. Yeah, Bailey's staked his credibility on the deadline for this emergency bond buying programme ending today. Quarting, of course, baited him to extend the programme. He said it would be a matter for the governor if the market turmoil continued. Well, in that game of chicken, if Quarting's about to you turn on corporation tax, it looks like Andrew Bailey's played an absolute blinder here. If the market turmoil does continue, though, what you may see is a more targeted creative solution beyond today. I was speaking to the former BoE policymaker Martin Wheel yesterday. He suggested that there could be targeted support for pension funds that need to raise a bit more money, but it would be a punitive rate. So perhaps that is what we'll see going forward. Yeah, we've certainly seen the Bank of England emphasising the support that will continue for pensions. And we've also seen certainly former civil servants I've seen calling for the government to take action on securing pensions. But Lizzie, thank you very much. BoE and Pax Lizzie Bird and now side the Bank of England with all the latest news flow from the political side and also the monetary policy side. Let's get to the markets and investing through this turmoil. With Nanette Heschlefator, who joins us now, CIO for Emir and head of economics and research at Credit Suisse Nanette, thank you very much for coming to talk to us today. So all of this turmoil in the UK markets, what do you think from an international investor perspective, away from the sort of day-to-day of UK politics? What do you think markets are looking for from the UK government to reassure, to take away some of the uncertainty and the nervousness we've seen? I think it is the fight back to policy credibility. So the UK is running a current account deficit that is around 8% of GDP. It has been with the mini-budget on a track to increase its budget deficit at the same time to levels that the markets have really not seen as a good policy. And in that context, the market is looking for the fight for credibility, which means tightening the belt. In other words, some of this U-turn is going to be taken as a positive by markets. This has already been the first signal, but then also tightening the belt in terms of the external balances will help the pound stabilize eventually. This is what the market will be looking for. Yes, how do you think the market responds, Nanette, when the government sticks to its line that it wants to be all about growth at a time when the market's head is very much preoccupied with all about inflation? How do you think that sits? Well, these two forces going one against another are just not going to work. This is one of the policy mistakes to, on the one side, try to cool the economy. This is what the central bank is doing. And on the other side, prevent the cooling with some fiscal expansionary measures. In the end, the only thing that this is provoking is for central banks to have to tighten even more. So these two things going against one another are just not helpful. And Nanette, clearly this volatility has thrown up opportunities. Do you see opportunities in any UK assets at this point? I think that generally speaking, in fixed income, when we are seeing yields that are pushing up and perhaps even more extremely than what fundamentals would be suggesting this is starting to open up opportunities. So we see yield yields over the next 12 months stabilizing 4.1% for 10 year materialities. And at these levels, I do think that fixed income in the UK is starting to give opportunities. Okay, that's interesting. I mean, you need to see some stabilisation, perhaps in the post bank of England intervention fixed income market. You need to see stabilisation at the beginning of next week for that to really be a realistic proposition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2713,2022-10-14 06:11:53
14488," the post Bank of England intervention fixing come market. Do you need to see stabilization at the beginning of next week for that to really be a realistic proposition, then, yes? Or does it look, where does it look favorable now? I think so. We would want to see in some sense the, the, the, the reassurance if you like, from the policy side, that we are on this stabilizing track. And so those short term signals are going to be helpful in milestones to determine an entry in some of the bond investments that look attractive at these levels. Nanette, thank you very much. Stay with us. Nanette Heschenfeather from Credit Suisse. She stays with us. We're broadening our conversation shortly with Nanette. Coming up though, just to tell you on the UK front, we'll be speaking to Angie Sentens, the former external member of the Monetary Policy Commissioner, the committee of the Bank of England. He'll be joining us. He's currently Senior Economic Advisor at PWC, and he will be speaking to the team 9 AM, London time. Let's get a Bloomberg first-world news update. He with the talk stories is Alice Atkins. Good morning, Alice. Morning, Anna. The US investigation into the use of outside messaging services like WhatsApp at major banks is now sweeping in record keepers at big investment firms. Bloomberg has learned that SEC has asked money managers for details of who oversees retention of electronic communications at their firms. The US regulator has already issued about $2 billion in fines for improper conduct, compliance and record keeping. The US House Committee investigating last year's attack on the capital has voted to subpoena former president Donald Trump. Lawmakers want to question him about the 2021 riot and are demanding documents and testimony about his role. The move comes just weeks ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Europe could be heading for a mild winter this year. Scientists at the Copernicus Climate Change Service say temperatures will probably be significantly above normal during the peak heating season between December and February. A milder winter would reduce demand for natural gas, which European countries have been rushing to put into storage. Global news, 20,000 a day, on air and on Bloomberg, will be a quick take par by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg, Anna. Thank you very much, Alice Atkins. Joining us here in London with the first Wednesday's update. Now, coming up, the banks are back. Ernie season kicks off. Once again, with America's largest lenders leading the procession, we'll look ahead to those results. Plus, we talk all things race with Ralph Prusser joins us. Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, head of race research. It's a great voice to have today on the UK gilt market. Also on treasuries post that to CPI number. And up next, we'll think about that CPI. Coming in hot, US core CPI jumps to its highest level since 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the economy. We discussed that next with Nanette's Keshwifei Derbful Credit Suisse has as that affects her strategy. If you have questions, please do send them to us. IB plus TV go. That's the function to use.

There's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible.

14489," Refusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. A multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on, these got absolutely crushed. We'll show you what's happening in ETFs like no one else. Bloomberg ETF IQ Monday on Bloomberg. It's clear that inflation is a challenge. It is a global challenge. Americans are squeezed by the cost of living. It's been true for years and folks don't need to be a report to tell them there'd be a squeeze. I don't know if it could be soft landing. I don't think so, but it might mild recession or tough recession. My point in the tough recession, yeah, you expect the market under the 20% to 30%. I think what's now really clear is that they are going to hike us fast. They are going to get inflation down. And that the US economy is actually in very good shape. Some key newsmakers that weighing in on the CORE CPI data, which came in another 40-year at another 40-year high. Exceeding estimates, the numbers add pressure on the Fed to continue hiking and likely cement another jumbo hike of 75 basis points still with us. The net, Hesla Fadeh, from Credit Suisse. So post the CPI data print then, Nanette, weigh in with your up-to-date expectations for how quickly the Fed increases rates and where they get to in this rate hiking cycle. Oh, I think very clearly on the market has immediately reprised for that the next FOMC meeting will give us another 75 basis points hike. I also think that it is now a biasing the terminal rate for Fed fund rates at 475, perhaps higher. But certainly any hope of pivot from the Fed will reserve in the course of 2023 is just premature. So any hope of pivot. And when you say pivot, do you mean actually cutting rates, Nanette, or you expect a pause next year, do you? Yeah, I think that the terminal rate is going to be reached relatively rapidly over the course of the first quarter, certainly the first half of the year. And then the Fed reserve is likely to keep that at that level for most of 2023 before we can then really think about focusing again on the real economy as opposed to inflation in monetary policy making. And when we listen to, let's think about also where we've been on equity markets in Nanette as we desperately look for a pivot. But as you point out, it's premature to do so. We saw something, some buying of the dip yesterday, Nanette, post that CPI number. What did that tell us? All kinds of explanations out there to do with short covering to do with what Jamie Diamond had to say about the strength maybe of the US consumer. What did you think was happening in markets yesterday? Did it tell us anything important? It's very difficult to interpret these wild swings. Wild daily swings yesterday was really one day as far as equities are concerned. I think for one that bond markets and bond yields are giving us probably the more reliable information content at the moment, bond yields moved up. So at the shortened of the curve, more than under long end, but what it is telling us is a consistent focus on this inflation, especially core inflation in the United States. And I therefore continue to find a little bit suspicious what has happened yesterday on equities. We remain underweight equities in our investment strategy. So you don't think yesterday was any kind of turning point, man. So it's something not as significant.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2715,2022-10-14 06:20:33
14490," on equities we remain underweight equities in our investment strategy. So you don't think yesterday was any kind of turning point, Nanette. So something not not not as significant as that. And with that in mind, Jamie Diamond talking there about whether if we see a tough recession in his view, we it's not unusual in a tough recession to see stocks down 20, 30 percent. Of course, we've fallen a long way already, Nanette. What what is still the downside for stocks? That's always the key question here. I love to to also work with technical analysis that gives us a bit more about the psychology, but because really right now there is a lot of influence of market psychology. And we have important levels in the S&P 500 at 3590 in terms of supports. And if those get broken to the downside, for example, our technical analysts think that this could reach out right to 3200. So it gives you a sense that there is more downside possible. Nanette, thank you very much. Nanette, Tashifeta joining us there. The CIO for Imea and Head of Economics and Research at Credit Suisse. Coming up on the program, we fix our attention on China and we will keep it there over the weekend.

For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2716,2022-10-14 06:24:39
14491," What they told us they're going to do, right? So the markets may not like what they're doing in certain cases, and they may wish that they were doing something else, but the key to successful central bank intervention is to actually do what you say you're going to do. So I think the challenge that you have in the UK, for example, is a lack of credibility and a lack of clarity. The Fed is telling us exactly what they're going to do. They're doing it, and the markets are responding. Welcome back to Bloomberg Markets, Europe. Some of the voices talking there about what the markets are seeing at this point, what the Fed is doing. We still have 40 or so minutes until the start of the cash equity trading session here in Europe a little bit less than that. Let's turn our attention to China though. China's Communist Party, the Congress begins this weekend with a host of challenges facing the nation's leadership. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's China Government reporter in Beijing, Colin Murphy column. What is the mood like then in Beijing ahead of the party Congress? Right, so we have like two days to go, and I would say it's pretty tense here. I mean, we have always had rigid application of the COVID restrictions, but they're even more intense now. And the delegates are starting to arrive in the capital from all over the country. There will be two thousand or more of them at Sunday's meetings and subsequent meetings next week. So security is quite high, and the main goal is to make sure that everything goes smoothly, that there's no major incident. And that's basically the top priority on everybody's minds here over the next couple of days. And what are you hearing about these rare protests? What are they protesting about and what has the response been? Right, so given that backdrop that I just explained, whereby everybody's on paying attention very, very closely to every single thing, the fact that this protest yesterday did actually take place is really, really shocking. We saw that this man has posted two banners across the bridge in a very popular busy part of the city, not far from the university district. And on those banners he was calling for such things as an end to COVID regulations, people wanted to eat, they don't want tests, and also calling for democracy and criticizing heavily, Xi Jinping himself. So of course, we went out there, we checked out the scene, and within a couple of hours of the protest, it was already pretty much wiped with just very small remnants of where this man had actually lit some sort of fire in order to attract attention to the banners on the bridge. The sensors have subsequently stepped in and have, of course, wiped the web of any references to this. And in some cases, people are saying that they've had their access to WeChat, denied to them permanently because they had shared information that was deemed to be sensitive. Of course, this is a big thing for people here because the messaging app is more than that. It is a lifeline. It's also necessary for payments, et cetera. So definitely a very swift and harsh response to this. But the fact that it happened, the fact that it met into international media is a huge embarrassment for Xi at this very sensitive time. Colin, thanks very much for the update. Colin Murphy, there of Bloomberg News, for us in China. And we, of course, will focus over the weekend on what he's going on in China and bring you updates on Monday as necessary, with that important Congress taking place. Now, just to tell you what's going on on the markets, we have Asian equity markets looking really strong. The MSCIA is a Pacific up by 2.4%. We're only picking up the lead from what we saw on Wall Street yesterday. We were down by more than 2% on the S&P at one point yesterday. And then rally to be more than 2% higher by the coast. So real strength coming through on the US session and then into the Asia session, and various reasons as we discussed earlier, being put about for that. Coming up, we will talk about UK politics. This is Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2717,2022-10-14 06:29:11
14492," х A.I. is the chance of humankind to really understand itself. How much of that is true? How confident did you actually over achieve? Did you, you know, back then realize that we would be using A.I. in many different jobs? Was it slower or faster than you thought at the time? I think if I had a 35 or 40-year prediction task, I would have been more or less on track as to where we are today, but I would have predicted steady linear increase over time. But instead, the field had very minimal improvements until the last five or ten years. Then it really took off. I think we ended up in the right place, but I was very wrong about the trajectory. To this day, we still know very little about how the brain works, but these machines are getting ever more powerful. And I feel in some sense, we did end up learning how what human intelligence is by learning what it is not. If we exclude all the things machines can do better than us as what makes us unique in our human intelligence, then now we can rule out many, many things because A.I. or machine learning has become so good at so many things that what's left must be the key aspects of human intelligence. Welcome back to Bloomberg Market's Europe. We still have half an hour to go until the start of cash equity trading. Here are your top stories. UK tax U-turn Prime Minister Liz Trass prepares to abandon key measures of her economic plan following weeks of market turmoil. Chancellor Quanty Quanty raises back from Washington. Coming in hot, US inflation hits a fresh 40 year high, all but guaranteeing a jumbo rate hike next month by the Fed. Plus record reversal, the S&P 500 defies expectations swinging from a more than 2% loss to close 2.6% higher, hurting market bears who sold in the wake of the CPI report. The rally continues in Asia. Welcome back to the program, everybody. It has been a roller coaster over the past 24 hours, strength on wall streetpaps unexpectedly and many people's views after we expectations in the future as the set low post the CPI report that came in hot cemented expectations of further rate hikes. But then we saw a rally in stocks and various explanations to short covering, maybe Jamie Diamonds comments around consumers, all kinds of theories being put out there as to why that happened, but stocks went higher and the rest of the world is following. So European futures look higher after the Asian session has been pretty strong. Let's get a Bloomberg business flash. Top corporate stories we're covering this morning is Alice.

That's your Bloomberg business flash Anna. Alice, thank you. Alice, here in London, now the mother of all U-turns. Liz Truss' government is preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda after weeks of chaos in the markets. The chancellor has cut short his trip to the United States and is heading back to London just hours after insisting he's not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on 31 October as I said earlier in the week and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. Quieting there. And so the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's gamble ending an emergency bond buying program today. Does it appear to be paying off? Joining us now is Bloomberg's Lizzy Burden who is outside the UK Central Bank. Lizzy, what has changed then? It's been a busy 24 hours, even if that's not being acknowledged just yet by the chancellor. The market seemed to have forced the chancellor's hand here. We saw sterling and guilt's rising in response to reports that there would be a U-turn on the corporation tax freeze. Of course, Boris Johnson had planned to raise corporation tax from 19% to 25%. Now it looks as if Truss and Quarteng will only raise it by a smaller amount, but not freeze it all together. Quarteng on his way back from Washington, but really Andrew Bailey's played a blinder here. Quarteng had baited him, saying that if the market terminal continued beyond the emergency bond buying program ending today, that it would be a matter for the governor, Bailey has stood firm. It's Quarteng who looks like he's blinked first. And when my colleague Phil Aldrich in Washington asked whether dropping plans for this package would end weeks of turmoil in the UK market, Bailey had only a grin. If the terminal continues though, Anna, it looks like perhaps there may be a more creative solution than this blunt instrument of quantitative easing. It would mean that the Bank of England can get on with fighting inflation, put that priority above financial stability and not look like it's dominated by fiscal policy. In terms of that fiscal policy and where that leaves politics, Lizzie, can Liz Truss survive? Well, many would ask what's the point of having Liz Truss if she cannot pass her economic strategy. She looks as if she's in power, but not in office, but not in power. Now the Tory party is the most successful party in history for a reason. The rules could easily be changed so that they could have a new leader like a snake shutting its skin. The reports now are that perhaps she could be replaced by Penny Morden and Rishi Sunak, who of course ran against her to be the leader. But whoever took over from Truss would have a hugely diluted mandate. It would put massive pressure on the Conservatives to call a snap election. And at the moment by the polls, it looks like Labour would win.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2719,2022-10-14 06:37:51
14494," It would put massive pressure on the conservatives to call the snap election and at the moment by the polls it looks like Labour would win it. Okay, Lizzie thank you so much, Boomba, Lizzie Berder and apologies for the noise in the background there, animated members of the British public at 7.35 in the morning. Let us get a market perspective on this. Ralph Prasad joins us. Global Head of Rates Research at B of A. Global Research. Ralph, really nice to have you with us. I suppose anybody at Downing Street right now, number 10, number 11, wherever they are, they're all wanting to understand what it is that the markets want to see here. They might not do it, but they don't want to get a sense of what would calm the markets. Do you have a sense of what would calm guilt markets, Ralph? Well, the minute the rumors of the U-turn came about, we saw the market reaction very clearly. We had a three big figure rise in starting yesterday. We had a very significant rally in guilt. The market thinks that those are steps in the right direction. And is that what's needed? Steps in the right direction? Is that what matters more, the signaling, rather than maybe the size of the billion-pound number attached to any U-turn? It's both, obviously, right? So we know that the whole is large, according to the IFS, it's 60 billion. It's seen in the end. According to our economists, it's more like 50. Regardless, it's a big number. And we heard from Lizzie just now on the speculated chain run corporate taxes. If that were to only go up by three percentage points is opposed to six. Neither number is big enough to fill that hole by itself. So more needs to happen. But I think the signal of the government understanding the constraints that the market faces and adjusting to those would already be a very important step in the right direction. We were talking there about, you know, Andrew Bailey is getting very positive press now for taking a hard line in the sense that it looks as if the government has blinked. And maybe he was, he's held his line. He said he'd stopped this extraordinary package by Friday. Is it too soon to declare that that is a good decision? We don't know what happens on Monday yet, do we? We asked me again at Market Close. It'll be very interesting to see how the Good Market reacts after the buyback operation this afternoon. But the bank of England was an impossible position, right? There's a clear case for stopping the kind of collateral run that we had coming through the LDI mandates earlier. But you don't want to be put in a position where your bond buying program is perceived to actually be bailing out the chancellor as opposed to, you know, addressing very specific liquidity issues in one very specific part of the market. And the longer you leave that program place, the more the market risks, worrying about what ulterior motives actually are. Right. And right, before they introduced this program, we told they actually were working on something more targeted, more specific. They couldn't do it quickly enough. So that's where they did the big thing that looks a bit like QE, which is why it gets confused with just other QE programs. Now they're trying to steer more towards another package that's going to be in place until November the 11th we understand, but it looks more targeted at some of these pension schemes. Do you have any sense, Ralph, of whether that's going to be enough to calm things? The question is, well, there's a number of questions. Where exactly do the liquidity issues arise? What parts of the asset pool needs to be unwound or do pension funds want to unwind to meet those margins, calls that they've got coming through on their, on their overlaid duration hedges? But what the bank of England is now clearly trying to do is to work this through the repo market where instead of having to sell, you can raise cash against the existing assets. Now whether or not they've targeted the right assets in this, is a question that none of us can answer until we actually see it playing through. But we shouldn't also forget that this issue has now been with us for quite a while. And I'm sure that everyone in the background will have worked very, very hard to stress this, their collateral buffers, and make sure that a repeat of the kind of price action that we saw would not close the same issues again. Okay, that's interesting. So, because I wonder in that context, how we read the numbers coming through in the daily tenders from the bank of England? Because if you get a big number, some people say that looks comforting because it looks like the pension funds are taking it seriously and doing a lot. On the other hand, a big number, does it make you think, wow, there's a lot of, you know, we don't know how much leverage there was in the first place. But I also don't know who's currently using the opportunity to sell into the bank of England, right? So the assumption is that it is pension funds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2720,2022-10-14 06:42:37
14495," He's saying, wow, there's a lot of... And we don't know how much leverage there was in the first place. We also don't know who's currently using the opportunity to sell into the bank of England. So the assumption is that it is pension funds using or LDI managers using that upwind of opportunity that they currently have. But there are many of other market participants in the guilt market who might take this opportunity to actually reduce the exposure to the UK, given the policy uncertainty that we face. And I would just point you to the positioning server that we put out this morning, which shows bearishness on sterling the currency, being the most pronounced bar the referendum period of summer of 2016. Can we get back to fundamentals around the guilt market at some point? And when we do, what are you looking for? What will be... I mean, we don't know the details of the fiscal package, I suppose, now. Do we? We're back to that point. But that's the key uncertainty, right? Is at the end of the day what we're dealing with is a situation where we know we need policy tightening because we do have genuine underlying inflation pressures in the UK, but how much of that policy tightening ultimately would come through rates and through the Bank of England versus how much of it will come through fiscal policy is the big unknown. At the moment, we have the view that the Bank of England will have to do most of the heavy lifting. Our economists see base rates going all the way to five and a quarter. But that could well be lower if we actually end up with a much smaller, unfunded fiscal boost than the one that we currently still working on as a base. We talked entirely about the UK, and I think that's very relevant, obviously, today. I do want to briefly just get your thoughts on treasuries at this point. We saw some response, of course, to the CPI number yesterday. Was there anything that we think is sort of under-reported on that CPI data, anything that's being missed by investors or is this just an overshoot on CPI? Means another jumbo hype from the Fed? There we go. I don't think it's quite as simple as that. So, yes, that is the new Joe Gragsion. It's very understandable, and I wouldn't fade it. We now finally have Fed funds pricing in line with our economists, according to FOSFIS, the Fed is concerned, so peak Fed funds rate of some of which is in 4 and 3.5%. But we do see goods disinflation starting to work its way through the CPI basket. We do have very significant strengths at Dylan's services. And within that, we have potentially somewhat misleading numbers on owners equivalent rent and the strengths at the housing market. So, next week's housing market data, I think, is going to be an important cross-check to some of what we had in CPI. But the underlying story that we are telling and that from what I can work out most of our competitors are telling as well is that over the course of next year, that goods disinflation will turn more meaningful and will aid the correction in US inflation. Okay, Ralph, thank you so much for joining us. Really good to have you with us this morning. Ralph Bruster joining us, global head of rates research at B of A, global research.

Welcome to Bloomberg crypto. Welcome back to Bloomberg markets Europe. Still 15 minutes until the start of cash equity trading. The future speaker looks pretty bright. US markets turned very much more positive after that CPI report. Initially triggered some weakness, of course, more on stocks shortly. Let's get to our colleague Valerie Taitel, though, our market senator who joins me here on set to talk about what's going on in oil markets and the link with inflation and this is really interesting because you might assume that higher interest rates will weigh on oil prices. That might be the desired outcome by central bankers, but I know that our colleague, Avi, Blast has been writing about something alternative here. Yes, so have you heard of recent column made a good point that I've been hearing from other pockets of the market that I wanted to convey to our viewers? And his point is that maybe higher interest rates will deter investment into oil and gas so much. It actually ends up spurring inflation further. Now, the way that he does this is he looks back on the era of green span. So my chart here, let me get into it, is the federal funds rate versus this yellow line. That's the US crude production. So, Javier in his column states that maybe it was the green span era of ultra low interest rates that sped up all this investment into the shell boom of oil production in the US. And that was really the key driver. So, if we take a step back and now realize that we're exiting this period of ultra low interest rates, what does that mean for oil and gas investment? Does that mean that the industry which we need so much to rein in inflation by decreasing prices actually is still going to be competing for funds? It begs really good questions and it's not just the oil and gas industry that deals with this, but the renewable energy industry. Again, it's highly leveraged. It's highly sensitive to changes in these interest rates. And I think this narrative might gain a bit more traction that maybe higher yields can actually spur inflation further. So, yeah, really interesting point isn't it? If it's all about investment, if that is the crucial transmission route, it's not just about supply and demand. It's about investments as well. Valerie, interesting point. Thank you for bringing us that chart. Now, let's turn to the US banking sector. Another sector very focused on the interest rate story then. US banks are set to kick off what will be a closely watched third quarter earnings season when they report later today. City Group and JP Morgan are among the first up. Their earnings and outlooks will be heavily scrutinized for clues about the state of the industry. For more, we're joined by Bloomberg's Charlie Wells. Charlie, good morning to you. We've got a lot of very different banks than reporting today on Wall Street. Can you give us the most important theme, I suppose, that investors should be looking out for today? The focus really will be on the future today. So, of course, earnings reports are backward looking. But what everyone wants to figure out is how our banks planning for the state of the American consumer going forward. We've, of course, heard Jamie Dimon's comments about a potential recession, about the consumer. And one figure that will draw a lot of attention today is the amount of money that banks have set aside for potential bad debt. Now, Bloomberg estimates that the six largest banks have set aside $4.6 billion for bad debt. If that number actually ends up being bigger, that is a very negative outlook for the American consumer in the months ahead. Okay, and with that as the backdrop, those are the key things to watch, then, Charlie, in this environment, how are the big banks expected to perform? So, the outlook.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2722,2022-10-14 06:51:04
14497," American consumer in the month ahead. Okay, and with that as the backdrop, those are the key things to watch then, Charlie, in this environment, how are the big banks expected to perform? Look, so the outlook is not great. Expectations are low, so we're estimating, you know, that within the S&P 500, banks are actually going to have the biggest profit declines, but of course, we shouldn't write them off entirely. So net interest income has been pretty good for banks interest rates, of course, are going up. And you've got a really interesting story when you look at EPS estimates for JP Morgan. So right now, that are about $2.88, that's worse than this time last year, but it's actually better than February when the estimate was $2.80. So more complicated than simple doom and gloom. Okay, okay. Well, at least if the doom and gloom is complicating, I don't know, is that some sort of consolation prize? Charlie, US inflation exceeded expectations yesterday. That was the CPI print, the big number we were watching for. How are banks going to navigate that challenge? Of course, Fed Hikes follow from that. You know, they like higher interest rates in some ways, but they don't like recessions. Of course, yes. So they do like that they can potentially bring in more of that net interest income. Of course, if that consumer, of course, as we were talking about, is in a bad position that could potentially mean less appetite for mortgages, less spending on, say, credit cards. And so that is certainly something to look out for. And of course, what staffers inside banks are concerned about is layoffs of reorganizations. But interestingly, let's say there is a recession. Atlantic equities put at some interesting research that show that banks actually underperform in the early stages of a recession, but tend to fare fairly well, 30% better than the market on average than other sectors, because they tend to recover quite quickly, despite the negative narratives around them early on in a recession. So on my optimism theme, not looking great, but looking years or at least several months into the future could potentially be better than we might hear today. Okay, Charlie, thank you very much. Charlie Wells here with a preview of what to expect from the bank earnings season. And that is very soon upon us. When we come back, we'll talk about the stocks in focus and in amongst that, we'll be a bank. Credit Suisse is in focus as Japan's Mizzouho emerges as a suitor for at least part of the Swiss bank's Securitized Products Group. We've more on that and other stocks in focus next.

14498," from the market. Welcome back to the market. It's at Europe 7 minutes until the start of cash equity trading futures point a lot higher. Let's get to the stocks we're watching. Danny Berger joins us with a breakdown. Danny, let's start with credit suites. Yeah, we are seeing credit suites trade a higher pre-market on trade trade. We're seeing a lot of credit suites trade in the whole entire market. But there is a specific story here that might also help propel it. Another buyer emerging for their securitized products business, their group, according to people familiar, telling Bloomberg this time, it's the Japanese bank, Muzouho. This is adds to a list of Apollo, center bridge, Pimco, six street. There might just be some excitement that perhaps there's a bidding war perhaps. Credit suites can get a pretty penny for this business. Of course, it needs that money in order to fund the restructuring they're planning on doing. Okay, and then Denon, the French food company. Yeah, so some news around here in one of their Russia businesses specifically, their central dairy and plant business on Russia. They're nicheting a process to transfer control of this. This will mean that they're going to take a write down on the company. They expect about a one billion euro write down on this. They are still going to sell some other central nutrition products to the region. But again, it's just this long process of withdrawing from the market there. And then, the Royal Mail is the new slow here. Yeah, so we got some numbers from Royal Mail on their earnings, a loss, but the real headline grabber was their plans for letting folks go. They're planning on cutting about a thousand jobs or so. It's also projecting an operating loss for the year now in terms of why they are doing this. They said that it's partially because of the strikes, because of the lack of productivity, because of that. But it's also some of the other issues facing shipping groups, and the other issues are also going to be there. So, the other issues facing shipping groups right now, we heard it from FedEx, just lower personal volume, so that's also biting into their earnings. Okay, Danny, thank you very much. Danny Berger here with the stocks in focus this Friday. It is Friday. Let's have a look at the GMM and see where the broader market picture is. A real strength to the Asian session coming through, up by 2.3% in Asia on the MSEI Asia Pacific, but really just picking up from that strength we saw on Wall Street. And what was that all about? Down by more than 2% at one point just as we got that CPI print, and they're rallying to much stronger than 2% higher by the clothes. Lots of theories out there. Jamie Dimon's comments, short covering seems to be one that's getting quite a lot of play, expectations around the bank profitability that's coming. We're going to get bank earnings over the next few days. Anyway, FX markets don't show quite such volatility. Yes, we saw a big move in the dollar yesterday. Fairly flat right now, which is interesting. Again, still a little weaker, 147.46, which is of course nearly around a 30-year high. It hit that after the CPI.

We want someone to put electricity on the grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion. They can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Welcome to the European market. Open everyone. Happy Friday. A minute to go until the start of cash equity trading and froncing like what in London would Tom McKenzie? And here are your top stories. US core CPI comes in at the hottest level since 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the economy. A 75 basis point hike next month is all but solidified. Tax you turn. List Trust is said to be preparing to abandon a central part of her plan following weeks of market chaos. Quasiqua tongue flies back early from his US trip. And ahead of this weekend's Communist Party Congress in Beijing, we look at how President Xi is securing his plan to stay in power. Now, let's look at the future. Tom, this is a picture across the board. I mean, one session we had last week in the US yesterday in the US. It feels like last week, but it was only 10 hours ago. The tax features getting some 1.5%. And it really goes to show if you're a trader in these kind of volatile markets, you don't really know where to place your bet, especially when you have that hot inflation coming out of the US because, of course, two interpretations. And we saw that yesterday. Yeah, absolutely bonkers day on US markets. Yes, one point, yes, and P 500 was down at 2.4%. It ended the session up 2.6%. Despite, of course, that red hot, higher than expected inflation print, is this a bare market rally that we're seeing? And of course, we have to factor in what's happening here in the UK as the B.O.E. prepares to step away from its bond buying action. Here's how markets are opening then. In the Spanish Ibex, getting 1.5%, the FTSE 100, up 76 points, up more than 1%. And the CACC aren't getting 1.5%. Picking up the battle, then, from a very strong session, stateside, a very strong session in Asia, and that is reflecting through the European market in the first few seconds. Let's switch it over to our cross asset board as well and get a sense of how the futures are looking. But before we do that, we'll check in on Sterling. A big day, as I said, as the B.O.E. assesses, whether it can indeed, as it said, it will walk away from those bond purchases as the Chancellor returns to the UK to work through the mess that is the fiscal plans for this government. The pound currently gaining, look at that, over two days, 2%. Currently at 1.13, will this hold? Let's switch it over now to cross asset. We're looking and we want to bring your attention to the action in Asia as well. Currently up 2.5% on the HS Tech, which is those big companies, of course, Hong Kong listed tech companies, at 1.5% to that, rally following through, particularly pronounced within the tech stocks in Hong Kong. On the future states side, pointing to build on those gains of yesterday, up 6.10% of a percent, the 10-year at 3.89, that's a move lower by four basis points on the benchmark yield 3.89. Brent, $94, a barrel gaining 3.10% of a percent. Let's switch it over and have a look at the guilds then as they open on this important day for UK bond markets. Currently you're seeing a bid then.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2725,2022-10-14 07:04:03
14500," of 8%. Let's switch it over and have a look at the gilts then as they open on this important day for UK bond markets. Currently you're seeing a bid then, a modest bid for UK debt currently at $359 on the two year. That's a move lower by two basis points to five year at $424. The benchmark at $4 holding at $4 a move lower by a little under two basis points. In fact, let me re-correct. In fact, you're seeing a 20 basis point move now at 22 basis point move on the five year and the benchmark 10 year 18 basis point move. So these are big moves lower in terms of yields across the yield curve here in the UK. The 30 year, the longer end, of course, 438 is what you're looking at here in the UK as we weigh up again. The purchases yesterday, around £4.6 billion of purchases, but again, the prospect of the B.O. steps away, Francine. Yeah, I have to say, with these higher interest rates, piling pressure are not already struggling economy. It's really difficult to see where traders go. So hopes that the Fed will consider a dialing back its aggressive rate hikes have been dashed again by hotter than expected inflation. Core U.S. CPI jumped to a 40-year high of 6.6 percent to year on urine September, President Biden acknowledged there's more to do to combat rising prices. Americans are squeezed by the cost of living. It's been true for years and folks don't need to be to report to tell them they're being squeezed. Fighting this battle every day is the key reason why I ran for President of the United States. Let's unpack all of this now with Bloomberg's Christina Kino and T.S. Longboard's senior global macro-stragist Skylar Montgomery Coney. So thank you both for joining us. Christina, you look at the kind of the crazy moves, actually. The wild swings that we had yesterday and talked to us a little bit about what this means for traders on how you position in this kind of environment. Well, Francine, I think yesterday's report just drives home the point that there is more work to be done by the Fed in terms of tackling this inflation picture, right? I mean, yesterday I think the clear sign that we saw of really the market reaction was in the short-end rate space where traders put those bets back on. It's now, I think we're now pricing three consecutive 75 basis point rate hikes over the next few months. And you know, that narrative kind of came pulled back a little bit over the last few weeks when people were started to see signs of inflation peaking a little bit from the housing market, a little bit in wages as well. Sometimes the labor market looking to be easing off. But yesterday's number really just kind of poured cold water on that narrative. And I think that is danger, right? Coney, peak inflation, always dangerous. Redhead Cross and the terminal right now. We hit it at the market open, just worth reminding on a massive day for the debt markets here in the UK. So UK bonds absolutely surging in the first few seconds of the open, the first few minutes. Currently, you're looking at the 10-year. That is a 13 basis point move lower currently trading at 4.06 the two-year. That is a 13, almost 14 basis point move lower. And the 30-year training at 4.43, that's a 12 basis point move lower. So money is moving into these bond markets, whether this will be sustained, of course, a key question. And we'll get more on the UK situation as well, of course, in the minutes of head francing. Yeah, so we need to really try and understand what this emergency program ending for the BOE means. And again, you're right. This is just the first couple of minutes where they're opening. So let's see longer term. What it means, Skylar, we'll get, we'll get to the bank of England, of course, some of the pitfalls for a lot of the pension funds. Shortly, overall, what kind of environment are we in? I mean, we've been in this environments beginning of the year where you've had very volatile inflation. Inflation keeps surprising to the upside. So inflation surprises have been positive pretty much across regions throughout this year. And not spent, we keep getting a repriced and higher in the terminal rate. And, you know, it's pretty much a one faster model for a lot of markets right now in terms of a higher terminal rate means you get higher yield, means you get lower risk assets. And we just keep kind of going through these cycles. And that's what we've seen this week as well. And so, you know, we're in this kind of market where it's very dependent on inflation. It's very dependent on us in the terminal rate. And, you know, you just need to be watching the data closely to treat it as a result. So, Skylar, so, you know, Christine was pointing out the market's pricing in three 75 basis point hikes remarkable. So you talk about the terminal rate. Do you see that above 4.6% next year? Do three 75 basis points look reasonable at this point for you? I mean, I think what the inflation data told you was that demand is still very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2726,2022-10-14 07:08:29
14501, percent next year to the three 75 basis points look reasonable at this point for you. I mean I think what the inflation data told you was that demand is still very very strong. It's very robust and we've been saying that throughout this year in terms of gasoline prices you know everyone thinks that they feed out of inflation and they are feeding out of inflation in a mechanical way. The gasoline prices have a very strong correlation to consumer confidence and so the gasoline price is coming down but speeding positively into consumer confidence and means consumers are spending more and goods elsewhere and this is more of a U.S. problem and it is a problem elsewhere in terms of you know U.S. inflation is much more demand driven than European inflation which is much more supply driven and as a result the Fed has to do more to damp down on inflation because if gasoline prices are coming down prices are rising somewhere else and so for us we think that you know we get a price in the five and a half percent in the terminal rate our TPS economists you let's expect that to be five and a half percent. So Christine what did we learn actually from the CPI print apart from the fact that it's a nightmare and we could see actually quite a deep recession ensuing. I know the Fed swaps are leading towards I think what three quarter point high spike to back I mean that's aggressive. That is going to be really aggressive Francine. I think really the takeaway here is that the hope for a softer land day or perhaps maybe short quick recession might not be coming to fruition here. I think it really does tilt the balance towards more of a harder landing which is you know part of the narrative that we've been seeing I think it was Goldman was saying that you know it is more likely now after yesterday's print and yeah I think that that kind of just kind of puts the extremes of the potential economic outcomes into next year. I mean I think there wasn't initial hope that perhaps oh the Fed can raise it to that restrictive rate maybe keep rates at that level and see how that plays out for the economy but given what we saw yesterday in terms of the CPI print and then also the potential for the pain that inflicts on the economy and demand I think we will potentially get that immediate U term once we hit that terminal rate which is currently priced for about March 2023. Scarlett I want to get your thoughts on the here and now the markets. You're seeing gains of 1.7 percent across European stocks you have the whip sawing yes they down 1.24 percent gaining by the end of the session 2.6 percent how do you characterize this market is this a bear market rally that we're seeing. Yeah I mean I think it's really you know representation of how the market's trading right now in terms of global tightening it's occurring on a scale that we've not seen in decades the central banks are not only hiking in large magnitude but they're doing it quickly at the same time central bank balance sheets are shrinking and direct government deficits are increasing so that means you know government supply is increasing well the man is decreasing and yields are rising on the back of that because of this tightening and on top of that you've got a consistent dollar strength and that's getting further into that tightening pressure and all that means is you know volatility is rising and it's rising and it's going to stay elevated and that means market fragilities have been exposed and so yes this reaction I think is as a reflection of you know that volatility and I think you know these fragility you know they were built up because we had a decade of formula rates and QE and the market saying you know there are fragilities from higher rates and the tightening cycle isn't stopping anytime soon so I think that means that we're likely to get more accident like what we saw in the UK and we're starting to see cracks in the data so if you look at the OFR that's right the OFR is financial stress index that looks at financial stress through five factors safe assets credit volatility funding and equity violations and while that weather is well below levels consistent with the global crisis it has risen to a two-year high and that's led by higher volatility particularly rates volatility and I think we're going to continue to see these kinds of sharp moves as a result yeah further sharp moves hold on to your hats T.S. Longbirds Skyler Montgomery Coney is going to stay with us very pleased to say Bluebo's Christine Aquino thank you for walking us through all the action particularly on the back of that hotter than expected CPI Clinton coming up you turn if you want to Liz Truss is reported to be preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cut plan we're going to bring you the details this is Bluebo.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2727,2022-10-14 07:12:44

Welcome back to the Bloomberg European Open. This is a picture for a guilt. You can see two years, three, six, three, zero, the third year at 4.437. Now they seem to be showing signs of a recovery after the historic sell off. Again that recovery actually started yesterday afternoon. It's been a week of extreme volatility in bond market. So if we have a one week look at what's been happening in so for example 30 year rates soaring about 5% on Wednesday, it really shows volatility in the whip sign that we're seeing so for the moment a bit of stability. Again a bond surging at the open. I think I was told yesterday look when the markets get very bearish it doesn't take much to snap back. So let's see what happens in the next couple of months. Yeah talking to that uncertainty around the fiscal plans and it's uncertainty about the B.O.E. will they indeed continue to buy bonds after today they've set themselves a deadline many in the markets think they'll have to step back in and what exactly is going to be changed within this fiscal plan from Liz Trass and Quattro. Yeah so in what could be a stunning new turn the Prime Minister Liz Trass is reported to be preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda after weeks of chaos in the markets. Now the chancellor has actually cut short his trip to the U.S. and is heading back to London just hours after insisting he's quote not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed I will come up with the medium term fiscal plan on the 31st of October as I said earlier in the week and there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget making sure that we get growth back into our economy I'm not going anywhere. Okay that was a chancellor of course the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey's gamble ending an emergency bond buying program today appears to be paying off Bloomberg's Lizzy burden joins us from outside the Bank of England. Lizzy what was the turning point then from this government?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2728,2022-10-14 07:17:08
14503," Appears to be paying off Bloomberg's Lizzie Bunn joins us from outside the Bank of England. Lizzie, what was the turning point then from this government? Well, Mark, it's priced in a U-turn yesterday. The pound and gilts rose on reports that we would see a U-turn on the corporation tax freezes. And actually, the reports are that Liz Truss and Quasie Quoting will raise corporation tax. Perhaps, though, not as much as Boris Johnson had planned to from 19% to 25%, but this was a key plank of Truss andomics as part of her efforts to boost growth. So it's a massive U-turn. You've got Quasie Quoting coming back. It's massive when the Greek finance minister had to return from the G20 in 2011 to deal with the sovereign debt crisis, although his allies are shunning that comparison. And the question now is, will Truss survive? The Times is reporting today that the Tory party could change its rules and she could be replaced by Rishi Sunak and Penny Morden, who, of course, ran against her for the leadership, but whoever would replace Truss would have a massively diluted mandate. There would be huge pressure on them to call a SNAP general election and, by the polls, at the moment, it looks like Labour would win that. Yeah, we also just got some breaking news. The Bank of England, reserving the right to boost the size of the final guilt buying operations, Lizzie. So it's the last day of this emergency bond buying program. Is it likely that Bayley will need to extend it or have they bought so much of the stuff right now that we should be fine? Well, it looks like, in the game of chicken between Quasie Quoting and Andrew Bayley, Andrew Bayley's won and it's Quahteng who's going to have to do the U-turn. Remember Quahteng said that if the market turmoil continued and Andrew Bayley didn't extend this emergency bond buying program, it would be a matter for the governor. And Bayley, on the other hand, has staked his credibility on holding firm to this deadline. It looks like he's going to get away with that. However, if the market turmoil does continue, perhaps we'll see a more creative solution on how to help pension funds. I was speaking to former BoE policy maker Martin Wheel yesterday. He said there could be targeted help for pension funds. But crucially, Bayley is going to be desperate to not continue with the blunt instrument of quantitative easing because at the moment it looks like they're prioritising financial stability over inflation fighting and being dominated by fiscal policy. It seems perhaps okay as an emergency measure, but not something to be extended. That's what the IMF's message seemed to be yesterday. Lizzie, thank you so much, Lizzie Brunner reporting outside the Bank of England for us. Now, T.S. Longbirds, senior, global macro-stranded Skylar Montgomery, Aconing and Bloomberg, Christina Kino are both still with us. Skylar, do you buy anything in terms of UK assets right now? I mean, I think the short answer is no. I think the longer answer is obviously there's always a buying opportunity. At some point, it depends on whether or not you're a tactical trader or not. But I think when you look at UK assets, and even if we do get this big U-turn, and the U-turn would definitely be a positive in terms of you get a pop-up. I think even if we get this new turn, confidence has been completely shaken, right? And the U-turn doesn't add to that. And I think I've seen a couple of quotes around there that's essentially, they say that in terms of confidence, it's the elevator down, the stairs back up. So it takes quite a lot to build that confidence. And structurally, the pound was the week we named before we got the NINI budget. You had yields higher, lowly. And you can't actually use it without the form, but the structural backdrop in the UK is not good. And that's where you saw those asset market performances in those ways, in terms of UK growth is slowing, we're headed towards a recession. And there's not a lot that the fiscal authorities can do, and they've certainly done a very poor job what they have done. But there's not a lot to stop that growth downgrade in that growth recession. So that massive knock to confidence, and it comes down to credibility. Christine, I want to bring you in at this point, the turnaround that we're seeing in the guilt markets today, and Francine was rightly pointing out the volatility that we've seen, dramatic volatility in the UK bond markets over this week. But does today point to a turning point for UK guilt? Are they managed to cap things now?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2729,2022-10-14 07:21:42
14504," seen dramatic volatility in the UK bond markets over this week, but does today point to a turning point for UK GILTS? Are they managed to cap things now or is further volatility something we need to be thinking about in the days ahead? Well, today the turnaround I think in GILTS is really the best case scenario for the market in a lot of ways. On the one hand, you have the BEEF facility. Yes, it is meant to be ending, but that is meant to be temporary, although Andrew Bailey, reserving the right to continue some kind of measure in the future, would definitely be calming for investors. And then on the other hand, you have the government you turning or potentially you turning on a key part of its fiscal policy, which really was the root cause of the meltdown in the first place. And so, you know, a lot of investors are kind of looking for the scenario where a BEEF facility that was always meant to be temporary, finally being wound down, and then the owner is being put back on the government to essentially reel back the policy that was destructive for markets in the first place. And the markets need to see that change crystallized, because for the moment, its speculation crystallized on Monday. Do they need to see that coming forward early and soon from the UK government that change in corporation tax? Yeah, this is a key point, Tom. I think nothing is set in stone at the moment, and so we still need certainty on this potential U-turn. I mean, we could be sitting in a best case scenario right now for markets, come Monday morning, that could very easily change the worst case scenario, if indeed that U-turn does not materialize. Yes, at the same time, and we know that there's a backstop to the backstop, right, in terms of buying guilds, and I think it's a backstop through the facilities available to the banks to actually get liquidity for the pension funds. It rolls off the tongue, it's called the temporary expanded collateral repo facility. How much will that help? I mean, I think what you're seeing generally from the bank is England, and from the government is, you know, and this is not just in the UK, it's everywhere, right, in terms of they are backstopping financial stability, and I think that facility will help quite a lot, generally, nowhere wants to slowly market, so more wants financial stability risk with these kind of amplifiers that risk contagion into the real economy and risk contagion into other markets. So I think, you know, well, we likely get the end of the temporary bond buying program. If we get to slowly markets again, there's no way that the bank England can't step in again. And so, you know, we're putting these temporary stock at kind of band-aid measures in place in a lot of countries, and, you know, I think they'll help, but if you get to sort of the markets, they have to come back in. Skylar, very, very quickly, do you hold your short position on the pound? Yes, yes, and we've actually got it, I mean, we'd like it for us to stay in generally, but yes, we still have one since kind of November of last year. Skylar, fantastic insights. Thank you. Happy Friday. Have a great weekend. Skylar, Montgomery Coney, senior, global macro, it's trash, it's a T.S. Longbutt, and of course, Brubo's Christine Aquino.

Blackbrox assets under management dropped 16% in the third quarter to the lowest level since 2020. That left the world's biggest asset manager overseeing just under $8 trillion. It's pulled money from several Blackbrox offerings including equities and cash management as central banks hiked rates. Core products attracted $65 billion of net inflows missing estimates. Bloomberg has learned that Miser Ho financial group has emerged as a suitor for part of Credit Suisse's Securitized Products Group. Sources say the Japanese bank is competing against interest from Apollo Global and PIMCO and others. Credit Suisse says the platform which employs about $20 billion in risk weighted assets is highly profitable. And Bloomberg has learned that CROGA is entire up talks with rival Albertsons, a move that could create a US supermarket giant. Sources say a cash and stock deal could value Albertsons at about $25 billion. According to data from numerator, CROGA is the number two grocery player in the US while Albertsons is fourth. That's your Bloomberg business flash, Tom Francine. I was at Kenti and London. Thank you very much. Indeed, it's briefly checking on the markets. Then you're seeing gains across the European benchmark, stocks 600 gains of 1.2%. Percent, the sex is standing out at the moment. Real estate, basic resources and chemicals all gaining around 2%. And in terms of your bond markets, GILTS continue to be bid though less. That is coming off. That bid slightly from the open. You see some yield move of 12 basis points at the front end currently at $3.67. But again, less pronounced than about 10-15 minutes ago. The ten year at 4-11, that is a move lower by 8 basis points. Again, the Bank of England could be looking to buy around 5 billion pounds worth of additional GILTS. And its final day of operations, of course, will they be forced to extend? Coming up, pricing in a fiscal U-turn UK bonds are surging this morning. As we mentioned, the Bank of England's intervention set to end in just a matter of hours.

14506, My grandfather got into the Mutual Fund business because the average investor could not get a diversified stock portfolio and it was too dangerous to put your entire savings in it just a couple of companies. So the Mutual Fund was created to give a diversified expert management at a reasonable price. Today we have a phenomenon where companies are waiting much longer to go public and so in 2000 the average company went public after three years. Now companies are waiting nine to ten years because there's so much money available in the private markets. As a matter of fact there are half the number of public companies that there were in 2000 and there's five times the number of private equity back companies. So just from an investible universe you look at the private markets and it's you know significantly bigger. So the question is that return that used to be captured in the public markets is now captured in the private markets. But the problem is you know is you're really tied up for a long time when you invest in a private equity fund. And so trying to figure out a way to solve the same problem my grandfather was trying to solve which is how do you bring those returns responsibly the democratization of the of the private markets to the retail investors and I describe it as a bit of like running the scissors. This is a great tool if you use it appropriately. And so we're focused on trying to figure out responsibly bringing it into the average investor. Before you change the world Bloomberg. When US jobs numbers are released Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. Welcome back to the open everyone 30 minutes into the European trading den here are your top stories risk on returns European stocks surge at the open extending the remarkable rebound that began yesterday on Wall Street while Gill yields slide on bet that the UK government will cancel plans for large tax cuts. Physical U-turn will list trusts said to be preparing to abandon this central part of her plan following weeks of market chaos. Quasic-Quarteng the chancellor flies back early from his US trip. US core CPI comes in at the hottest levels since 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the economy 75 basis point high next month is all but solidified. But then time you look at the markets and of course they kind of seem to you know defy this rates outlook and the gloom out there on the economy. Yeah it's remarkable the action in the markets given that hotter than expected CPI print out of the US and expectations of we're talking with Christine Akino from Bloomberg earlier about three 75 basis point hikes from the Fed going forward from November through the months ahead of course but despite that you did see a rally that some of the carats rising maybe as a bear market rally maybe we're washing out some of the short positions maybe there's some technical factors outplay everyone trying to work out what is going on in terms of the optimism the users in these markets and whether it's going to be short lived that is the sense of course from many out there the bear market rally is that what we're looking at gains of a little over one percent across the benchmark over in Germany that acts up 113 points in the FTSE 100 here in the UK up 910s of 8% the chancellor of course hot footing it back from DC to London to work through those fiscal plans and of course we watch any lines that come out on the back of that given the reporting yesterday on this potential you turn particularly around the corporation tax and to what extent that will assuage the markets the bank of England of course expected to end its bond purchases later today so expect them to play a heavy role in these markets until that deadline is hit switch it over and see how things are playing out across these sectors then the last time I looked every one was in the green that remains the case real estate basic resources and chemicals all up around 2% of the bottom of the list but still in the green up 610% is auto's and parts retail as well so still the music is positive for very strong sessions in the US in Asia overnight as well and now carrying on into the European markets but will it be sustained and to what extent will the moves of money into guilt continue as well,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2732,2022-10-14 07:34:30
14507," Very strong sessions in the US in Asia overnight as well and now carrying on into the European markets but will it be sustained and to what extent will the moves of money into guilt continue as well because the yields have dropped but not as much as at the start of the session. Some of that is being paired so suggesting again that this can be volatility until we get more clarity on those fiscal plans and the BOE's role. Francie? I wonder how much the BOE is buying right now. China's Communist Party Congress begins a sweet gend with a host of challenges facing the nation's leadership. I think the longer term picture in China is still bright because I know the people and I know the culture and I think it's good but they have major issues now. We do not seek a cold war. We do not ask any nation to choose between the United States or any other partner but the United States will be on a bastion promoting our vision of a free, open, secure and prosperous world. It's not a time to create fresh ruptures, to create fresh cold walls between the United States and China. We have our scenario planning obviously. We all hope that there is no increase in conflict on Taiwan. Despite all the geopolitical things that are going, it's still a very attractive market. If China's economy continues to slow, the way we are seeing that will have a big impact on what happens to the world economy. You've got the number two economy that's not really jumping forward. Now to dive deeper into all of this, let's bring in Bloomberg, Rebecca, and Wilkins, Rebecca. Thank you so much for joining us. So the people's congress starts on Sunday. What kind of language should be watching for in the speech? Absolutely. Well these speeches do tend to be stressing continuity and we do have to approach them with a little bit of humility. It's typically quite difficult to actually trade the sort of political events themselves. But we are looking for these key language around just how seeds are playing plans to balance risk and security against development. And what he might tell us successes in Beijing's shift to focus more on the quality of growth rather than quantity for itself. And both of those things will provide some sense of direction for future policy. And Rebecca, have you and the team have documented so well over the last few months and years? Of course, a number of these policies from the Xi Jinping team have been damaging across real estate or technology and an impact across markets. Is there anything we can look for in terms of the markets, in terms of an uplift from the congress that we may have seen in the past? Absolutely, Tom. Well we have seen this more ideological shift driving, for example, some of these crackdowns on tech and properties, you say. And I think there is actually quite a strong mood of pessimism that has entered the markets. If you just take a look, it's very, very unusual to see markets perform this badly. This CSI, one of the worst performers in the world, the well-neared record lows offshore credit in the junk space at record lows as well. It is really quite unusual. So some bright spots potentially around green EV and the shift to sort of environmental and green transition, that might be one area to look at. And of course, the other area, really not necessarily a bright spot, but one area that's been monitored very closely is what happens with Taiwan. If there's any indication of an explicit timeline or an accelerated timeline for unification there. Rebecca, how are they dealing with COVID? I don't know whether we continue with the zero COVID policy going into 2023 or whether they're trying to actually get other vaccines that work better and free up the people a bit more. Well there was some optimism just a few weeks back that there would be relief for COVID zero, but of course we see cases rising in Shanghai. And one important indicator on passing future policy and what Xi Jinping says is to look at state media. And if you take a look at what we've seen over the last week, more and more of these big editorials and state publications making it clear that COVID zero very much here to stay for now. And we have these sort of big political voices making statements in the media reinforcing that despite the economic cost, COVID zero is still the way the way to go. Okay, Blue Boats, Rebecca, tune Wilkins looking ahead to that important point.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2733,2022-10-14 07:38:52
14508," to be enforcing that despite the economic cost, COVID-0 is still the way to go. OK, Bloomberg's Rebecca Turing Wilkins looking ahead to that important party congress that kicks off invaging on Sunday. Thank you. Let's check back in on UK assets there. And of course, on this crucial day, particularly for the bond markets. But I'll kick off with a pound, first of all, 112 on Sterling. That's a move lower by 6.10 of a percent. Bonds, GILTS are still bid, but yields, yeah, yields are down, but not as much as they were. It's more exaggerated at the front end. So you've got a 12 basis point move lower on the two year at 367, a 30 year, 449. That is a move lower by around five basis points, Frensie. So let's get back to the UK. We are looking at the GILTS. We're looking at what this U-turn could mean for pound. The Prime Minister at Liz Trust is reportedly preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda after weeks of chaos in the markets. Let's bring in Bloomberg opinions. Marcus Ashworth, Marcus, always, always great to speak to you. I'm looking at what you wrote this morning, which was, you know, funny as always, smart as always. And you basically said, the BLE made a massive gamble and looks like they could be winning this. Well, as you're all saying is, it better to be lucky than clever. And certainly, I think Bailey must be feeling he's won the political battle with the government here. Clearly, what the Bank of England has done with not changing its plans on QT as clearly people have been hoping. It looks like the debt management office has got out the Bank of England's way. That's the treasury moving for the central bank. And normally you should be able to go around. But clearly, Bank of England has got one last day to get its act in good. I suspect there's a chance they may increase the size they buy today. Said he yes, they was quite surprising into the index link part of the buyback. They bought an awful lot more than people expected, because it was supposed to be set to Monday's close, but they paid far higher for it than people had expected much larger size. And I clearly think they want to get on with it. Put an end to this particular buyback, but they've got a lot of other stuff they've introduced. They've taken the repo side to get rid of this collateral squeeze nightmare. And we saw the beginning of this three-week crisis. And possibly they managed to do something new. I think that's the way around it. And last bit, they've always got the ability to restart this program and carry that sort of big stick behind their back. It needed to keep by the guilt market, perhaps under a bit more control with it. It should be a lot. Keeping the big stick behind their back. Of course, linking inevitably to the politics of all of this, Marcus, is a cut to the UK Corporation tax, or in fact the increase they're going to reverse the cut? Is that really going to be enough to assuage these markets, even if they go full hog on UK Corporation tax, you're still looking at about a 40 billion pound hole in the UK spending. There needs to be addressed. Well, it's hard to separate the politics away from a simple dynamic that the bank is in. There's a lot of politics. So trying to separate the two is not easy. But I don't think it doesn't, it doesn't necessarily matter which bit gets changed. It's just that it is an element of the OBR, which marks the government's home work, hands back a pass. And that's always, however, the numbers that moves around is not necessarily relevant. It's just they want to see the prospect of unfunded tax cuts moved away. There's a lot more supply coming over the next year or two in the guilt market. It can be handled. You don't really need the bank of England's actually 7QT just now. That could be greater. They could delay that. But nonetheless, there are some positive dynamics in the next few months because the supply, which could see things settle down a bit. Let's hope. Yeah, but nobody wants to own guilt at the moment. And the government needs to issue a lot more of them. Who's a natural buyer if the pension funds don't step in? Well, I think some people do want to buy guilt, Francine. And the concept is guilty much higher. And in fact, they've stepped out of line with the rest of the world. And I would expect they will come back interline. Of course, it's all about your treasury does. And I think you saw a reaction off to CPI yesterday that perhaps people still are expecting the sped pivot after a hike, probably of 75, both the Bank of England and the Fed early next month. But there is hope that there is more sort of relief going to come on that. I think guilt at the long end looks cheap. And if things can settle down, I think that there will be buyers. Foreigners certainly with this turning this low could be tempted back. But we've got to get our homework done and presented and passed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2734,2022-10-14 07:43:31
14509," Well, down, I think there will be buyers. Foreigners certainly with this stone in the slope could be tempted back, but we've got to get our homework done and presented and passed with a big tick from the over your first. Do you see how he did that? I mean, the Ashworth doghouse for suggesting people didn't have my yellows. How'd you get out of the doghouse now, Francie? I'll bring donuts, Marcus. There you go. Marcus Ashworth, always brilliant, putting... But I was going to say putting Francie in her place, and that sounds a bit wrong, doesn't it? But maybe Marcus is the one snapping out these bonds. At the long end, that's where he says the opportunity is. Maybe. Thank you, Marcus Ashworth, for the Bloomberg opinion. Of course, you can check out his opinion pieces on the terminal and on Bloomberg.com. Let's get to our next guest, then, at least we'll tease our next guest. We're going to be joined by the CEO of 91, 100 Detroit. We're going to talk markets and how the biggest climate finance alliance could be, could be falling apart ahead of next month's COP27 in Egypt. This is a fund with about $150 billion assets under management. So, say, students, this is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in it, what women expect to do in a transparent, transparent world, how do they expect fun from future generations? Does minor levels include muscle surgery? Are there any other opportunities for it to come? What happens most in the future? also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci's really teetering on the brink of the stage. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Japan ahead right here on Bloomberg Television. I don't know if it could be a soft landing. I don't think so, but a mild recession or a tough recession. In the tough recession, you expect the market to end up in the 20-30%. I'm not going to give odds across those three things. But for all of us who have to worry about risk, you should plan for those things. JP Morgan, Jamie Diamond, who is not optimistic about a US recession, has been avoided. He spoke as CPI came in hotter than expected, but cementing a 75-basis point hike from the Fed next month. Now to discuss how this will impact global markets, rejoined by the two executives of 91 Hendrick-Dutoyed Hendrick. Thank you so much for joining us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2735,2022-10-14 07:47:55
14510," Next month. Now to discuss how this will impact global markets, we're joined by the two executive of 91 Hendrick, Detroit. Hendrick, thank you so much for joining us. Were you like hiding under your desk in extreme volatility over the last two weeks? I can't imagine when it's like actually being, you know, the head of a big asset management company where there's like all this stuff going around. Good morning, Francine. I'm Tom. I think you've got two things going on. You have a proper bear market for fundamental reasons. Then you have this artificial situation in the UK caused by essentially a kind of financial structure that was created by the pension funds. On top of that, you had a government that's, say, the least has limited credibility. And so if you're operating in the UK markets, you've got more than one issue to deal with. If you operate around the world, there is a general risk off market, which makes life difficult for long asset managers, even though we have a long-term horizon, you know, people look at the value of their investments. And as a view, the central banks keep going until either there's a recession or something breaks. What comes first? Well, our view is clearly that central banks will keep going this time because they were behind the curve last time. And actually, you can see some of the more stable, and we do quite a lot in emerging markets. Some of the more stable places in the world actually are the places which hiked early dealt with the issue and are kind of having a relative stability. So I think we're still going to see earring on the high side, not the low side, because in the end, Jerome Powell has read history, and he doesn't want to be Arthur Burns. Have you very optimistic? I don't know what part of the world actually has dealt with this. No, I'm not optimistic. I'm just saying the countries that have addressed and the ones that have hiked early. And South Africa, where I come from, is one, where currencies have been absolutely stable. External balances have been stable. In spite of issues there, because the central bank governor was ahead of the curve, not behind the curve. So you see that differentiation in the world. And I don't think this is going to end, and therefore you've got to stay ahead. I mean, we wanted to expand it, but you got to the UK as well, pretty early in this conversation. So we'll go there. I didn't want to get there, though. No, you did. You absolutely did. You had a glimpse in your eye when we talked about the UK. And you talked to us a little bit in the break. Are you buying anything in the UK? Any assets looking attractive to your middle with this turmoil that we're seeing? I mean, we have UK dedicated mandates, but is the UK has been perennially cheap market, not in the fixed income side, but in the equity side for a long time, because of structural reasons. The situation in the pension market has just pointed or put a spotlight on those structural reasons that there isn't a long-term risk pool in the UK, because you thought you could de-risk and then use derivatives and leverage something like a pension fund, which I think needs to be addressed. So what, they become much safer like the US, but do you also have this underlying problem of U-turns and unfunded tax cuts and the relationship with the Bank of England? That's what caused it, that's the symptom, and that's an issue in itself. But I think in terms of the UK, at the moment, the challenge, long-term for UK capital markets is, can it keep its own pool of risk capital to behave like a pool of risk capital, which is taking the counter? Now, if you've taken banks, if you made banks to safe, they're not going to come in and buy at scale. Jamie Diamond's got a balance sheet of one and a half trillion. He could have absorbed that 65 billion in no time. But there's regularly constraint on him, on the other hand, the pension system has been essentially neutered by this LDI story to say, okay, I can take all risk out. You cannot take risk out. Every country, every economy needs a long-term savings pool willing to take risk. And to use Marconi's phrase, the UK remains at the mercy or dependent on the kindness of strangers, which makes it a vulnerable, and therefore you lead to something ex-US, which one of my colleagues coined earlier this week, and I thought it was quite good. He talked about the EMification of DM. Where do you get U-turns now? DM the World Market Policy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2736,2022-10-14 07:52:03
14511," Earlier this week and I thought it was quite good. He talked about the emification of DM. Where do you get U-turns now? DM, developed market policy. Where do you get capital flows in and out upsetting markets, developed markets, X-US? So I think we're in a very interesting volatile challenge. Just briefly, what is the tactical trade at the moment for you? I mean, I guess tactical trade, everyone's relief. Ten years will probably do okay for a while. But in the end, if you look, and I'm in the structural game, we invest money for the very long term. Is this the end of the bond or the fixed income bear market? No. I'd rather go to credit and EMs where I can pick up higher, more distressed yields in the near term than a few basis points in a developed market, which is uncertain. All right, Hendrick. Don't go anywhere. Hendrick, the chief executive of 91 stays with us. We'll talk all about dollars, Frank, and actually, what that does to some of the emerging markets will also pivot to ESG. This is Bloomberg. When you think space, you probably think, one space agency that travels under the radar is ESG. Which is surprising considering what the European space agency has achieved and how vital it is to look local space industry. We've collaborated with pretty much everybody who is involved in space exploration. But ESG wants to be a leading force in furthering humanity's mission into space. Behind the ground for your coffee. If we want to have a successful human missions to Mars, we are going to have to learn to live a work off-world in a different way. The place where we are going to learn to do that is on the move. And ESG helps humanity take its next giant leap. We will never break, we will never break, build on a foundation strong enough to stay. So G-Fans is a huge alliance of more than 500 financial entities publicly committed to reaching zero carbon emissions by the middle of the century. It was celebrated at last year's COP26. But now Bloomberg understands major banks have tried to ditch the alliance ahead of COP27 next month. G-Fans is co-chaired by Michael Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP, and we call it the Carnie Shop. This was the former Bank of England. I don't know what job is harder. Whether to a meringue asset manager to be part of this or in charge of the bank of England right now. 91 is a member of G-Fans and the chief executive Henry Dutoyt is still with us. Henry, when you look at G-Fans and we had a conversation actually in New York two weeks ago with Mark Carnion. He was pushing back against the idea of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2737,2022-10-14 07:55:57
14512," is still with us. And when you look at G-Fans, and we had a conversation he was pushing back against the idea that asset managers are less committed to this. But if some of the regulators make it too hard for them, then they could slip away. There are two areas, political, US politics, and then independent from the politics is the regulatory challenge, where regulators are starting to put down their own markers and making it quite difficult because they seem to be driving towards a perfect world. And I must say, I must put my cards on the table. I'm on the advisory board of G-Fans for Africa, active, 91s, and active participant, and I think Michael Bloomberg, Mark Carney, Mirish Shapiro, doing Nigel Topping, all these people doing a fantastic job. And what they've done is moved the dial. It is mainstream in finance to debate whether you are part of N-Zero or not. That wasn't the case. So let's just look at the gain. Now we're dealing with the difficulty of regulatory framing around it. And I think we just have to have a very honest conversation with regulators that perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good. The reason why people are withdrawing is not because they're climate skeptics, it's because they're worried about the regulatory implications of being found wanting rather than whether the world is a better place in 2050 or not. It's the litigation, it's the litigation risks. It's litigation and regulatory pursuit. So it's both. And that's why I say two issues. A litigation is very much a US issue. But what about the litigation if you've held a whole lot of emitters? And they found to be, and the externality of emitting is priced in in 2040, 50, and they become worthless. Think of BP when it was part of that big oil spill and Obama administration find it at the size of this market cap. That could happen. I think bottom line, and we also have Jamie Dimon saying, look we're not doing CSF landing. It feels like the world could come to an end. What does it mean for the commitment of money, big money into ESG? If you have a busy week at the office and life is terrible, do you stop thinking about your children's future and their homework and their things to do because your kids one day must be able to be productive citizens? It's exactly the same thing in this. We must think both ways. We must deal with the recession, throw costs over board. But we cannot ignore that date 2050. So, Hendrick, unfortunately we've run short time. We're about 15 seconds away from the hard break. Thank you very much, Azheba. Of course, Hendrick, Ditoit, CEO of 91. We're going to leave you with what's happening in the guild markets on this big day for the B.O.E. and the bond markets here. Yeels lower by 20 basis points on the two year.

14513," Labs, there's also an emerging private fusion industry that attracted billions of dollars in capital in recent years. Governments and private investors alike realize that we've got to find a solution that's going to allow us to get to net zero targets. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing. We want someone to put electricity on their grid from a fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3000 gigawatts, a fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things that can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion that can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s.

Coming up on today's program, GILTS, Surgeon expectations at the UK government is preparing for tax cut U-turned-quasi-quartem flies back early from his US trip. US core CPI comes in at the hottest levels since 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the economy. A 75 basis point hike next month is all but solidified. And ahead of this weekend's Communist Party Congress in Beijing, we look at how President Xi is securing his plan to stay in power. Now first thing is first, so let's check on the markets and I think we're starting with GILTS. Of course, this is a momentous day, not only because the Chancellor had to fly back early from those IMF meetings, the Times reporting that we could actually see a U-turn or they're thinking about announcing a U-turn on some of the tax cuts and other fiscal plans as soon as today. But today is BSO emergency bond buying ending day. Happy Friday everyone. You can see that playing out on the market since yesterday when we heard about that U-turn over the last two days, the Bank of England has been scooping up and buying back GILTS. My question of the day is who is buying U-Kell GILTS now? A lot of people won't. I think we have one guest in the studio that actually is. So we'll get to Rupert Harrison shortly. The UK two-year yield, three, five, nine, four, you see on the longer end, thirty-year, four, four, one, one. Now it's quite extraordinary what's happening in markets overall. So let's look not only at the European stocks, but what's happening I think in the futures over in the US gaining two tenths of eight percent European stocks, one point one percent higher. Again, yesterday we saw a massive whipsawing of a lot of these equities today extending this rebound that we saw US stocks roaring back from losses parked by a hot inflation reading. It is quite difficult to position yourself if you're a trader with all of these quick moves and then sterling one, twelve, ninety four. So in what could be a stunning U-turn, the Prime Ministerless Trust is reported to be preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda after weeks of chaos in the markets. Now the chancellor has cut short his trip to the US. He's heading back to London just hours after insisting he's not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October as I said earlier in the week and there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get grace back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2739,2022-10-14 08:04:58
14514," But as I said earlier in the week, and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. And so the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's gamble ending an emergency bond buying program today appears to be paying off. Other things could actually turn quite quickly. Now we're now joined by Andrew Sentence, senior advisor to Cambridge, a common metrics for a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee and Rupert Harrison and portfolio manager for multi-assets, tries to black rock, former chief of staff to Georgia Osborne. So I feel like we're replicating. We have the Treasury, former Treasury, and former back of England. So thank you both for joining us. When you look at the big concern out there, of course is the big gamble, which I have to say, Andrew, is one of, I guess, the most powerful but risky moves that any central bank has done, saying in three days, that's it. We no longer buy it. We don't no longer buy guilt. We're not extending that program. Is it right because we're seeing a reversal from fiscal? Well, there are two things that Bank of England has been doing. One is this intervention in the market, which actually hasn't needed to be as dramatic as they suggested. They haven't used the bulk of the 65 billion pounds that they were committing. But there will still be in place until early November a repo facility, which financial institutions have access to. So there is a sort of backstop in that respect. So, Robert, what is the plan you imagine will come out actually from Liz Truss and her team? Well, at the moment, this is all speculation, so we don't know. Yeah. But it does seem pretty clear the government is preparing a U-turn on at least a very big chunk, if not something like half of the permanent tax cuts that were in the mini budget. And certainly, if we now, I think, don't get that U-turn, then I think markets will react very negatively, because we're already seeing that starting to be priced in. So, first yesterday, when the room was broke, and then this morning when it was confirmed that quasi-quadre was flying back from Washington. I think that markets are looking for something that is, as I say, on the order of at least half of what was done, that may not totally solve the problem, but I think as you're seeing from market moves, I think it will, certainly, by time to the 31st of October. Do you think Liz Truss is safe? Well, I don't, I don't, predicting British politics for months to months at the moment is a little bit difficult. I certainly think that this is the wise move for the government, both on an economic and political front. And given the situation they're in, acting early to stem the bleeding in markets, regains instability, definitely buys them some time. And I think that's the best she can hope for at the moment. So, Andrew, what do you think happens next? If we have a big U-turn along the lines of what's being leaked or at least what's being sourced by the media, is it enough to get credibility back for the UK? Well, I think what people will be really looking for is a comprehensive statement of the outlook for the economy and for the public finances. And that's what was lacking with this mini budget. Now that's now scheduled for the 31st of October. So that's still a couple of weeks away. So I think we're going to face a period of continued volatility. There may be some backtracking, as Rupert says, on some of these tax reductions. And that's probably going to be a wise thing. They can't wait two weeks, can they? Well, that's the schedule we've got at the moment. So we'll have to see. Maybe we'll see some sort of interim measures, as I say, perhaps postponing or reversing some of these tax reductions. Do you worry about Treasury not having the expertise for markets, given the departures of Scholar and others? No, I don't think the Treasury's expertise, all the bank of English expertise, depends on one single person. I think it's certainly a loss to the Treasury to lose Tom Scholar, but James Boehler, who's the new permit secretary, is very, very competent. And I think that the institution still have a very clear view of what's happening in markets. In the end now, this comes down to the decisions for the politicians. So you know markets get and you're buying guilds? Yeah, we have been buying guilds in the sense that we've been closing what has been a very long-standing underweight. We've felt for a long time that the inflation problems in the UK and the policy mix in the UK was not a good combination for guilds. I do think that there is a possibility now, if we do get a U-turn and a little bit of stability, that what has been a kind of negative reinforcing dynamic could turn into a positive reinforcing dynamic. If we get guilds down off the highs, there are many...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2740,2022-10-14 08:09:28
14515," and a little bit of stability, that what has been a negative reinforcing dynamic could turn into a positive reinforcing dynamic. If we get guilt down off the highs, there are many funds out there that are probably under-exposed now to guilt that may need to buy back into a rising market in a sense of sort of mild aversion of some of the negative dynamics we saw before. Of course, it's not the end of the story and I'm sure Andrew is right that we will see continued volatility. I think the 31st of October remains a very, very important date because that's when you get the forecast, that's when we get a little bit more clarity into the size of the problem. But I think what we've seen over the last few days is enough to buy time to that event. Andrew, what are some of the questions that you're asking right now? So do we need to reform actually how pensions work? I'm also sure about that. I think the issues with pension funds are really being driven by the speed with which the markets have moved, which wasn't anticipated. I think they were expecting bond deals to go up, but not so dramatically. And that's what's caused the market turmoil, as I understand it. I think we need to think about the way in which monetary and fiscal policy is coordinated in the UK. We have an independent central bank which is the right thing. But what's caused a lot of this turmoil is that fiscal policy appeared to be pulling in one direction. And monetary policy was pulling in the other direction. And therefore that means that risk was that the stimulus that was coming from the fiscal side would actually prove inflationary rather than stimulating growth. But Andrew, so if you see, but this also comes from some of the bulldozer and talk that Liz Truss had done into her campaign. I mean, once markets stabilize, and I don't know whether you're expecting that in the next two to three weeks, are we going to see the Bank of England and a government much more hand in hand, like we had in previous crises? Well, I think we're going to see quite a big increase in interest rates from the Bank of England at the beginning of November. I would say either 0.75% or one full percentage point, because they've got a bit behind the curve in terms of controlling inflation. I think my advice for the fiscal side of the account is to prepare the ground much better. I think Liz Truss has acknowledged this already. But to come out so quickly with such a major fiscal announcement with so little backup is what's really caused this problem. So we need more time for fiscal changes to be announced and to be considered before they're put into the public domain. And how quickly can that happen? So if you're trying to regain market credibility, and there was questions on whether, for example, the assumption for the OBR is a 2.5% growth, which would be very different to what we have right now. But in general, investors that may not be that familiar with the UK, how long does it take for them to say, OK, I'm confident that we're back. Well, I think there's going to be a risk premium built into UCAS. It's for some time. It's not going to suddenly disappear. But I think that investors can see the government changing tack, as I was just saying. I think they're now saying, OK, there's clear respect for the independent institutions, for the bank, for the OBR. We're going to get a independent forecast for the public finance system from the OBR. They are not going to take that 2.5% growth as an input. They may show a scenario, but their central case will be their central case. I think the key is going to be that even if we do get a U-turn now, we're talking about the numbers that are being discussed, also 20 billion plus, there still leaves a gap. And so I think there will be a lot of focus on the 31st of October about the credibility of the other measures to close that gap. I think we'll see a combination of spending cuts and maybe some other tax measures on the 31st. And then I think the ideal scenario for the UK government and for UK markets is that after the 31st, we're in a political row about those rather than a market's row about the credibility. The U-turn, you think is a U-turn on everything because we've also heard some fighting talks over the last 24-48 hours. Yes, sure. The thing about political environments like this is that the policy is the policy until it changes. So an official spokesperson at the moment has to say we're sticking to the mini budget, but it's pretty clear now that we are going to get some significant changes. I don't think it's going to be the whole package, certainly not right now. Okay, thank you both. Andrew Centin, senior adviser to Cambridge Economicrix, Robert Harrison, Port Philly, Mounder of BlackRock, both stay with us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2741,2022-10-14 08:13:30

Andrew Centin, senior advisor to Cambridge Economics, Robert Harrison, Portfolio, Madras, BlackRock. Both stay with us. We'll talk about the Fed and the wider worlds next. Coming up another hot month, US CPI for September rises more than expected. We discussed what that means for the Fed and the outlook for the US economy. That's coming up next. And this is Bloomberg. I'm so excited. Here's something being done. I'm going to work today. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most it's what we use to power devices for both work and play and maybe even your car. Over the past few decades they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. I don't know if it could be a soft landing. I don't think so, but in my mild recession or tough recession, in the tough recession, you expect the market under the 20 to 30 percent. I'm not going to keep odds across those three things, but for all of us who have to worry about risk, you have of course you should plan for those things. JP Morgan, you've executive, Jimmy Diamond, who is not optimistic about recession being avoided. Now he spoke as US CPI came in hotter than I expected, all but cementing a 75 basis point hike from the Fed next month. Overall, of course, the picture is exactly on what we've been talking about inflation, what it means for markets, and how the central bank is dealing with it. We're back with Andrew Sentence, senior advisor to Cambridge, economic metrics, Rupert Harrison, portfolio manager at BlackRock. Now that export price index, Andrew was talking actually asking exactly the figure year on year, 9.3 percent for the month of September, and the import price was 6.2 percent in the US year on year. We're back with both to try and have a conversation on inflation. Rupert, if you're a world leader or if you're like central bank around the world, do you look at the UK and do you reassess your plans for budgets? I think that the message has gone out that you need to be very, very careful about taking market stability for granted. I think that's very, very clear. I think that applies most in Europe, where you've seen quite a big debate in response to big German fiscal plans, where obviously that has big implications for countries with less fiscal space like Italy, and I think that's driving these discussions around more common debt issuance at the European level. But certainly, I think everyone looking at the UK will say, I don't want to be in that situation. More broadly, I think that it has highlighted this issue, that when you have rapid rises and it just rates after a period.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2742,2022-10-14 08:17:48
14517," But certainly, I think everyone looking at the UK will say, I don't want to be in that situation. More broadly, I think that it has highlighted this issue that when you have rapid rises in interest rates after a period of very, very low rates, you do uncover vulnerabilities. And so I think a lot of investors are thinking, okay, where is the next vulnerability that is going to be uncovered by this kind of rising tide? But are regulators on top of that? Well, look, we hope so. I mean, you have to say that actually the UK authorities have dealt with the issue in the UK pretty well. I think the Bank of England has acted swiftly and effectively. So in this case, hopefully, no lasting damage has been done. But of course, there's always an uncertainty. Where do you see the biggest vulnerability, Sandra? I mean, we spoke to Sarah Howard Davies of net West, and he was saying the same thing. It's once, you know, that the rapid rise in interest rates basically leaves swimmers naked. So what's the expression? When the tide goes out, you find out who's been swimming naked. There you go. Who has been swimming naked? Well, I can't comment on the financial market specifically, but I do think we've still got quite a serious problem of inflation. And that's picked up in a way that we haven't seen for 40 years or so. Inflation is nearly 10% here in the UK. It may yet go higher, depends on how the energy price package that the government's announced kicks in. The other worrying issue for inflation control is that a big spike in inflation like this is pushing up wages and pushing up other costs in the economy. And so we may see second round effects and a sort of continued above target inflation for quite some time. So I think that's one of the things that we need to focus on. So what should we be wary of? I mean, shadow banking is something that's also been increasing in the US and in Europe. Is that where we could see a black swan event? Well, there's all sorts of potential vulnerabilities in the financial sector. But what I would say is that we went through quite a rigorous exercise after the global financial crisis to try and make sure that banks and other financial institutions were properly regulated. And we didn't go back into those types of problems. So hopefully, as Rupert has said, the regulators are on top of the problems. And we haven't got too much in terms of hidden problems in the financial sector. Rupert, even like two, three weeks ago, maybe four weeks ago, we're still talking about the possibility of a soft landing. Is that now just gone out the window? I think it's very unlikely. I have to agree with Jamie Diamond that we heard at the beginning of this segment. I think that we are now heading for a recession in the US. Maybe a mild recession, I think we're certainly either in or about to enter a recession in Europe. I think the issue is more a medium term issue, which is that the CPI print yesterday was bad. It's really bad. We have got very deeply ingrained, very broad-based inflation in the US. Even more medium term concern is that wage growth, as Andrew was saying, in the US, is very, very high. And I think when you look at historical episodes, you need to have a significant increase in unemployment in the US in order to bring wage growth back down to acceptable levels for the Federal Reserve. Unless we get some very, very positive downsides, surprises in inflation and wages, that soft landing seems very, very hard to combine with acceptable inflation outlook. But so what could stop the dollar's rise? Do we need the world economy to get better? And how long could that take? Well, I think the dollar's rise continues. We've been long dollar for a long time, but we have reduced the size of that because we're getting now to some levels. And I think it's also interesting to see how the dollar's been trading over the last week or two. It hasn't been reacting to the upside quite in the same way, and I think there's a little bit more resistance. I think it's also interesting that some policymakers are starting to talk in the US about global fragilities brought about by the strong dollar. I think we've heard Lail Braynard, for example, starting to talk about that. I don't think we're anywhere near the mid-80s levels where policymakers are going to convene in some kind of plaza style agreements to try and bring down the dollar. So I still think that there is up side risk just because there is no... I think a good guide is every time at the moment the market is trying price of pivot in US monetary policy. That's something you want to fade. Because there is no evidence at the moment to support that. So thank you so much, Rupert and Andrew.

Global news, 20-ph, on air and on Bloomberg, quick take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. This is Bloomberg. Now, coming up, how luxury goods are weathering the storm despite inflation and recession alarms. Our interview with the Chairman and CEO of Montclair, Remo Rafini. Next, this is Bloomberg. There is an epic saying in Italy when it comes to family generations that the first generation creates, the second generation expands and the third generation destroys. And that's almost what happened in the Gucci story. So, hating and love together. Now I would have had much more experience about those who say that love you and then they'll trade you. The Gucci family was the strength but also the weakness of the label. The situation became dire with Gucci's finances. They were not able to pay salaries. They were not able to pay suppliers. Gucci is really teetering on the brink of the stage. The multi-trillion dollar industry. There's a lot of ground to cover. Come on of these guys.

Guilts, surge on expectations that the U.K. government is preparing for a tax cut you turn will quasi-quart time the child's return flies back early from his U.S. trip. U.S. course CPI comes in at the hottest level since 1982 with inflation spreading deeper into the ECOMU. A 75 basis point hike next month is all but solidified and ahead of this weekend's Communist Party Congress in Beijing. We look at how President Xi is securing his plan to stay in power. Well, good morning everyone and welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition on Fronting Likewise here in London. Recession, what recession? The luxury goods industry has been largely unscathed by the economic downturn and soaring inflation so far. Now, earlier this week, the French luxury goods giant, El Vieux-Mége beat forecast with higher sales as wealthy shoppers continue to spend to on top and retail. And with winter coming, luxury outweigh maker Montclair is ready to capitalize on that strong demand as it celebrates his 70th anniversary. Now we're now joined by a man who has catapulted the brand from a struggling label back in 2003 to a 12 billion dollar luxury giant. He is a chairman and chief executive of Montclair. Thank you so much, Raymond, for joining us. It is amazing. First of all, thank you so much for being in London because you've come from Milan. It was so much talk about luxury, about inflation, about where the world is. How do you see luxury developing over the next two, three, and five years? I mean, I think luxury after COVID is changed a lot. I think the people they want, totally different experience, the people love to stay outside, the people love to hiking, biking, whatever. And we have to take a consideration that, you know, digital becomes super important at the moment. Omnichanet becomes super important. And, you know, first of all, I think it's very easy, you know, from possession to experience. You know, the people really want another approach in the luxury world from meaning to dreaming, from dreaming to meaning, you know, is totally different approach. I think, you know, if we so, if we have in front of us, five difficulties, I think, you know, because the world is, they have trouble changing a lot. But I think if you stay tuned with your customers, I think today's more community approach is less one to one, the communication is really top down, you know, I think we have to really, really match all the experience we have in the last three years, that was quite good experience. I think this is the world is Omnichanet. Omnichanet in terms of everything, you know, in terms of sales, in terms of communication, you have totally a lot of platformer in front of you is not any more digital or that common. So how difficult it to keep on top of all this? You know, originally known as a engineering and out-of-wear company, but there are all these experiences and we were in one in London. And again, it's also maybe trying to be more straight-wear. You have had so many fashion collaborations. Does that change the perspective on how you want to shape the company in four years? Yes, I think it is again top down here to be able to talk with a different community all around the world, you know, and the culture of totally different, think about China, United States, Europe, the approach is totally different, that is not, is obvious to say, but it's not obvious to make it. So how is it approach different? So do people buy differently, for example, in China, the US? Much, much. In case the communication now is top down, you have to talk with the community and then the community come to your stores. Means this is the difficult things, you know, seems, you know, America is quite easy, not easy, but you know, because there is a lot of microcommunity today, but we know better. You know, China, for example, that's super important. Market for us is not obvious. First, we cannot travel there since March 2020. It's already almost three years and it's changed a lot, especially in the digital world, China improve a lot, everything, you know, and now the game is really to stay tuned with them and understand the culture, understand the ideas and understand what they're looking for. And this is really the game for the near future. And then if you think about for a company, this possession is important because we need to buy jacket whatever.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2746,2022-10-14 08:35:23
14521," and what they're looking for. And this is really the game for the near future. And then if you think about for a company, this possession is important because we need to buy jacquered whatever, you know, you have to build up an experience. Build up an experience to the world is totally different. And five years ago, I'm sure for the next five years, we really have to match physical and digital approach. I always say digital become very important, especially. Did you talk to what to make you dream, to make it appealing? Is it less physical stores to buy or is it just all about experience when you go to a physical store? Honestly, after COVID, physical became stronger, stronger for sure. But I always say digital.com, they come, will be the future for sure. But we are really to transfer the physical experience into the digital world that seems obvious. But it's not because now it's very catalog approach, every, every, every, become of the luxury world. I think the game is to be more immersed, give the possibility to be more immersed. I don't want to talk about metaphors. I think metaphors is not... Is something else? Yes, it's the next five years. But I think from now to metaphors, I think we have to build something, an organization, a structure, you know, in our.com that the people feel and experience. Otherwise, I think it will be difficult to transfer the, the revenues from the physical world into the digital world. So, does that mean that you also want to acquire companies that maybe do experiences or is it outside? I don't know, you've, you know, in terms of expansion, how much bigger will you be in five years? Yeah, this is very, you know, we're in front of us at a difficult moment. I think again, we have like six, seven short term, we have the election, we have the Congress in China, we have many things, the world in Ukraine, we have an inflection, an inflection is, I mean, it's quite tricky in Europe at the moment, we have the midterm in America, we still have COVID around. I mean, it's very difficult to say, I'm quite positive, you know, the company is super well-managed, we have really rigor in everything we do. And I think we have vision for communities, that's what I say before, I think, we have strong positively, we just make an acquisition on... Ston Island? Yes, Ston Island, one year and a half ago, I feel is, we're very concerned to redesign the organization, I feel they have potential to attract different communities in Montclerma, I can, you know, I feel that Ston Island can come in this new world of luxury, you know, that's, I really, I really feel is... I mean, how do you segment for a luxury? I mean, there's the very high end, there's the kind of high luxury, and then there's like the middle ground, is the high end, actually, almost, you know, recession proof, inflation proof, because you can hike prices when your raw materials are more expensive. I think the world is divide, I think, in two areas, and the actual world, I think the traditional luxury talking about Chanel, Hermès, the Earth, for sure, they're the strongest in this, but since three, four, five years, you know, this street, you know, think about Newborn, street, Montenapolo, and for the Ston Island, it was quite sad, five years ago. Now, a lot of young generation is there, thanks to some brand, Gucci was one of the first, we did with Genius, we attract a lot of young kids, Balenciaga, L'Ove, this kind of brand that give more energy to the customer, I think was able to attract new generation customer into the luxury world. And now, you match the old and classic, let's say, not old in terms of first-time, the traditional luxury brand with the new, upcoming luxury, but I think this, this energy you feel it, that you feel it, I think is something very positive for us, very positive, I hope, for Ston Island and in the near future. What are you most excited about the future? I mean, again, you're celebrating your 70th anniversary for the brand, which is quite incredible through all the phases that Montclair has been going through. Yeah, for Montclair for us is, I think the universe was very important to us to stop for a while and think of the future. I think what we did in the last 70 years, what they did, because I was not there, you know, because many of the companies in the last 20, I think was really not be trying the rules, taking with the roots, but at the same time be more than contemporary. And I would say to, it was my slogan when I've been public, it's a survival fashion. I think for us, survival fashion, we are in the fashion world, we're going to stay very consistent in survival, it's, I say every... It's a good, yeah, I tried to do that every day. Talk to me a little bit about, you know, if you look at politics, and certainly politics, in it's the, you're listed on the Melan Stock Exchange. What do you need from this new government to help you grow, to support you, and to attract investors? We are in a tricky moment, you know, because we just have a election, we're going to have the new government end of October. I think if we need the rigor, first of all, we need execution in economics, as you know...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2747,2022-10-14 08:39:48
14522," Just have a election, we're going to have the new government end of October. I think if we need the rigor, first of all, we need execution in the comic. As you know, our depth is very high. We have to control this reputation for the war. You know, I think in the last 400 days we have Mr. Draghi managed, managed Italy. I think it was a very good turning point for me. You know, we have a huge reputation all around the world. I feel when I walk in the street, when I talk to the people all around, you know, we're going to New York, Italy is Italy today. And now we have Italy, Italy choose another way to manage the company. The company, the country, which is like a company. It's so much bigger. For me, for me, for me is a company, you know, because they've dev, they've revenue, they've marketing and everything. Now, I think that this lady, Mrs. Meloni, she's serious. But, you know, to manage a company with 2.7 trillion debs, is another game that makes politics in general. You know, let's see. Let's hope. Let's hope and see. Thank you so much, Jorge Murofini. The Chairman and Chief Executive of Muclea. I like that. We all just try and survive fashion. Coming up, Liz Truss reported to be preparing to band in a central part of her UK tax company. We'll bring you the very latest on the UK. That's coming up next. And this is Bluebird. There's more activity in the fusion world than ever, and there's more more activity. This is one of the hardest but most rewarding problems that humanity could work on. Ultimately, we all want the same thing, we want someone to put electricity on the grid from the fusion power station as quickly as possible. Frankly, the scale of the challenge, 3,000 gigawatts of fossil fuel to replace. There's not many things they can do that. In fact, there may only be fusion. They can really do that. And while many in the scientific community predict fusion power will take decades, some in the private fusion space, believe we'll get there in just a few years as soon as the 2030s. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in a scene. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. I think the Fed is doing exactly what they told us they're going to do. Right? So the markets may not like what they're doing in certain cases. They may wish that they were doing something else, but the key to successful central bank intervention is to actually do what you say you're going to do. But I think the challenge that you have in the UK, for example, is a lack of credibility and a lack of clarity. The Fed is telling us exactly what they're going to do. They're doing it and the markets are responding. The Aries Management President, Chief Executive and Co-Founder, Michael Arugetti, on where he sees buying opportunities in the credit market. Now, the pound, lower, guilds bid this morning amid reports that the Prime Minister, Liz Tross, is preparing to abandon the central part of her tax cutting agenda. Now, the Chancellor.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2748,2022-10-14 08:43:38
14523," She's in the credit market. Now the pound, lower guilds bid this morning amid reports that the Prime Minister, Liz Tross, is preparing to abandon a central part of her tax-cutting agenda. And as Chancellor cut short his trip to the U.S., just hours after insisting he's not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week, and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. So as Bank of England Governor Andrew Baley's gamble, ending an emergency bond-bying programme today paying half-hour. We're joined by Lizzy Briden outside at number 10. So Lizzy, the U-turn on corporation tax now seems inevitable. How, what can we expect from it? Well, Quarting left in the early hours of the morning UK time from Washington. And if you look at the BA flights, you could deduce that he's either already on UK soil or about to arrive at about 10.45 AM. And you would assume that he'd be straight on his way here to number 10 Downing Street to see Liz trust for crisis talks. And you could speculate that they would make this U-turn before the market open on Monday at least, because this has already been priced in. And so they're not going to want to see a sell-off on Monday morning. And then his rushing back, perhaps it will be even sooner than that. But in terms of where it leaves Liz trust, more U-turns now seem inevitable. She does seem to be in office, but not in power. And there's speculation as well that the Tories would change their rules so that they can change leader to perhaps Penny Morden or Rishi Sunak who ran against her in the leadership campaign. But if they, well, whoever is the new leader would have a very diluted mandate, there'd be pressure for a general election. And at the moment, it looks like Labour would win. So Liz, where does it leave the B.O.E? Today's the last day of course of its one buying operations. Yeah, well in the game of chicken between the Chancellor and the Governor, Andrew Bailey seems to have won because it's Quarteng who seems to be about to do the U-turn. And of course, Andrew Bailey said that the pension funds had three days to get their act together. Implicitly, that seems to have been a message to the government as well. Our reporter Phil Aldrich was in Washington and when Andrew Bailey was asked whether this U-turn would be the answer to the market turmoil, Phil says, Bailey's response was a big grin. And so where it leaves the bank coming the next, if the market turmoil does continue but they end the programme today, perhaps there's room for a more creative solution. I was speaking to former B.O.E. policy maker Martin Wheel yesterday. He suggested that there could be targeted help for the pension funds that are in trouble. But really, Andrew Bailey is going to want to get away from the blunt instrument of Q quantitative easing so that he can focus on inflation fighting, prioritise that over financial stability and stop getting dragged down the path of fiscal dominance. That's what the message was from the IMF yesterday. Lizzie, thank you so much, Lizzie Borden, there was the very latest on this bond buying. Now let's bring in Bloomberg opinions, Marcus Ashworth. Marcus, thank you for joining us. Is this just the Bank of England governor being lucky or was it a genius move? I think what's really going on is the pension regulator behind the scenes is wielding a very large, probably very unpaidful stick to a lot of the pension trustees. Have you seen the price action yesterday, not so much the conventionals which show the banking was being very generous in their pricing, but particularly on the index link part, the linkers, people were selling at levels way, way further where they, the market is, because they've been basically told to in large size get out of these situations now and today I'm sure you'll see the same. They may even crease the amount they buy. I think the bank being very flexible on these things and I think they may buy a very large amount today, it's possible because I think the messages come loud and clear from that pension regulator. You have no excuses come Monday if you haven't sorted yourself out with the guards to collateral then I need you to sell into the bank of England. So, Marcus, how would you explain it? I don't, I mean it's very difficult to look at the numbers and say how much of this support actually came from BOE bond buying and how much of it is actually guilt buyers wanting to come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2749,2022-10-14 08:48:12
14524," It's very difficult to look at the numbers and say how much of this support actually came from BOE bond buying and how much of it is actually guilt buyers wanting to come back in because of the U-turn and the fact that they feel more at ease with the government plans. Yeah, it's difficult to always separate the politics away from, I thought it was more bank of England, but then with the politics going on, it's possible that quite a bit of it is. But there's also been a lot of speculators in here making a lot of money. Good for them, it's a free market. They're getting squeezed here as well, what a shame. So we will have some shorts, hopefully feeling a little bit of flame underneath them. Clearly, I think that we have to wait till Monday to be known at any of this works. The big gamble from Bayley, as the specters as they were saying, this isn't QE, they don't want to call it QE, but all the tend to purpose people feel like it's QE, but they may do other things next week. We also have the various repo measures in place which should offer a little bit more stability certainly on the sort of plumbing of the system, which has obviously gone very early the last few weeks. Yeah, so actually, can you talk to me a little bit about that? So what's this repo facility exactly? I mean, can it be a real backstop or because it has to be the banks for the pension funds, it doesn't have as much teeth as, of course, as Maccuffingland just swooping up guilds? Well, as we've seen in some of the stories coming out about Northern Trust having a sort of a log jam and they didn't have enough staff to process manually, the raft of cells, a lot of collateral requirements, particularly in declaring houses like the LCH, are required instantly that day. So if you sell something, you may only get it two or three days later. That creates a real pressure, which we saw the bank having responded by offering to buy the five guilds back. So in that context, clearly there needed to be something that sourced out to prevent that plumbing blocking up and they've done a raft of different things, some of them are temporary, but practically speaking, every week for now and permanently, you can turn up the bank of England and deposit whatever answer you have, long as it's sterling, investment grade, corporate bond, guilds, link, saline codes, raft of other different stuff, and they will give you cash. So that should create a much calmer system whereby people can know that they can get access to top quality collateral and since cash when required, selling assets as long as they are of a certain quality. Which the bank being made very clear, it's not just restricted to prime units or the gems, it's a wider thing rather than just banks and regular players. So Marcus, one of the things that you're very good at is also seeing stresses in the markets. I know you've been covering financial markets for quite some time. We spoke to Sir Howard Davis of NutWesk just two days ago and he was saying that he'd be casting as high on some of the areas of the shadow banking or really anything that could hurt significantly as interest rates are going up quite a lot because the LDIs really came as a surprise. Is there any area in the market right now that you are worried about? Well, I clearly, we've seen a massive stress test of leveraging the system which people perhaps turned up by a nighting though it was obviously hiding in plain sight. I mean, when you get super low bond yields for a very long time and you force pension funds into buying the man insurance companies and then all of a sudden yields just jump exponentially. Of course, there's going to be fallout. And clearly the shadow banking or indeed the hedge fund industry on a rough draw of the difference measures are exacerbated because of where we switch to the centralized clearing houses which is great news for counterparty risk. It solved the Lehman brother problem, the global financial crisis issue. Unfortunately what you've got now is a sudden requirement for only the best quality collateral intersecting those derivative trades every day on day, the variation margin. That's caused a massive squeeze as far as getting hold of cash when you need it and top quality collateral. That's what we call this problem. This is a wider issue, not just the UK markets but global markets. I don't think there's a radical solution needed. It just needs a bit of better regulation. The regulators have been asleep at the wheel. I mean, they himself was in charge of the financial conduct authority for a lot of the last few years. So a lot of questions need to be asked on how markets regulate, not just in the UK, but let's start the UK because clearly we need to get our act together. Marcus, thanks so much. Marcus Ashworth, there are Bloomberg opinion columnists. Now coming up Chinese authorities move to censor social media after an extremely rare protest criticizing President Xi Jinping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2750,2022-10-14 08:52:32
14525," Thank you so much, Marcus Ashworth, for their Bloomberg opinion columnist. Now, coming up Chinese authorities, move to censor social media after an extremely rare protest, criticizing President Xi Jinping just days before the Communist Party Congress. We have plenty more on that story next, and this is Bloomberg. What do you think of when you think of a battery? For most, it's what we use to power devices for both work and play, and maybe even your car. To the past few decades, they've gotten way more powerful, long-lasting and affordable. But all of this is just a prologue to what the next batteries are going to do. As we drive to an increasingly renewable power driven grid, we also need to be able to store energy and release it later to cover those periods of weather intermittencies that are driving this new grid that we're in. It's a multi-trillion dollar opportunity, and it's imperative that we figure out the solution here. How we store energy on a massive scale is in many ways the central challenge of the fight to stop climate change. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world we calibrate. To decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. This is Rotterdam, March Nordic France on about 2030. As remaining on the path now, it's a year but Islam prevuses the way some of歌 begins. Thank you for joining us. Well, there's two really key terms I think that investors and traders in particular will be watching. The first is how seed-imping balances the need to manage risk and security with development. This slogan has sort of become more prominent over the last couple of years and really speaks to of course those crackdowns that we saw on tech property, this idea of common prosperity. The other thing to look at is what sort of successes that seed-imping touts as good indicators of China's move to emphasising the quality of growth rather than quantity of growth. And that will give some kind of indication of the direction of travel. So Rebecca, is there any hope for a lift to markets after Congress like we've seen in the past? Well, absolutely, I think typically we do expect to see a little...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2751,2022-10-14 08:56:33
14526," But for a lift to markets after Congress, like we've seen in the past. Well, absolutely. I think typically we do expect to see a little bit of a boost usually coming into Congress, actually. And there was some optimism that there could be lifting of policies around COVID-0, for example. But unfortunately, I think there is, you know, a much deeper pessimism has set in. It's very unusual to see markets, everything from equities to currency to credit markets, performing so badly like this, ahead of a key party event. Normally, there's a big emphasis on stability and ensuring things up. But it is really sort of a reflection of sentiment because of the slowing economic growth and the continued drag on the one hand of this property crackdown, but also of ongoing COVID lockdowns. And really, when we look at some of the recent state media commentary, it does look like we're going to see a doubling down on the efficacy of COVID-0s, at least for the next few months. All right, Rebecca, thank you so much. Rebecca, tune a welcome. So we, of course, have a lot going on. On Sunday, it's the People's Congress in China. Today, it's all about Andrew Bailey, Guiltz, and what we hear or not from the government on that new term. Bloomberg surveillance, early edition, continues in the next hour. Kelly Lines in New York and Edwards here in London. And this is Bloomberg. Apple's delaying its next major iPad software update, iPad OS 16 by about a month from September to October. Apple made the decision for a number of reasons, including a still buggy, stage manager multitasking interface, and in order to link the launch closer to the more similar macOS Ventura. Still, it's an unusual move. Since shifting the launches to the fall in 2011, Apple has released its new iPhone and iPad software updates simultaneously each year around September. By staggering the releases, users may find some issues around compatibility with cross-device features like retracting and editing messages in iMessage, the new shared iCloud photo library, and the new feature for transferring FaceTime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features to cross iPad OS 16 and iOS 16. Regardless, it was still of course the right move. Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy, I don't find it particularly intuitive, and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps on the app store. The feature clearly needs some more polish, and complaints from consumers about stage manager will now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. When US inflation numbers are released, the score is inflation 1 fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. Core CPI in America 40 year high.

14527," Make-up is in flesh. She are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go a hundred bases twice? The downshift just keeps getting pushed out. Now it looks like we're going into extra-annies. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your Global Business Authority. There's a lot of uncertainty here. There's much less certainty around the dynamics at the moment. I think everything is a tight run. Frankly, everything's on sale. I mean, we're down 25% on equities from a year ago. People are really hesitant. That means they think the market isn't oversold yet, and we're not going to have the bottom yet. This is Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition, with Anna Edwards, Matt Miller, and Kaley Lines. It's 10 a.m. in London, 5 a.m. in New York, and 5 p.m. in Hong Kong. Our top stories today. Record reversal, B.S. and P. 500 defies expectations, roaring back from losses sparked by that hot U.S. inflation reading. Asia and Europe join the rally, but U.S. futures now fade. UK tax due turn, Prime Minister Liz Truss, prepares to abandon key measures of her economic plan following weeks of market turmoil, Chancellor Quarthing raises back from Washington. And JP Morgan, C.C. Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley kick off bank earnings season today with the fed hikes in focus, Jamie Diamond warns is unlikely the central bank can pull off a soft landing. Welcome to Bloomberg Surveillance, early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Kaley Lines in New York, Matt Miller is off today and Kaley, whatever it was that caused that intrued day reversal in U.S. stocks yesterday, certainly successfully spread around the world through the Asia session and then into Europe. Yeah, whatever it was, Anna, I was watching the charts yesterday wondering what was possibly going on after that hot CPI print. Thankfully, we're going to have Danny Berker break things down for us in just a moment. First though, I do want to check on Asia, which as you mentioned, really followed through on the rally we saw here in the U.S. The MNCI Asia Pacific indexes a hole at 1.8% overnight. Certain pockets of outperformance as well, including from China, where the CSI 300 rose about 2.4%. The party Congress beginning this weekend, but also maybe lifting risk sentiment there is the fact that inflation data out overnight came in a little softer than expectations. You also had Japan outperforming the NK-225 up 3.25% actually the best day for those stocks since March. But one Japanese asset not having the best day is the Japanese again weaker against the dollar today to 147. 65. Of course, yesterday hit the weakest level going all the way back to 1990. So we are watching potentially for fresh intervention in the Japanese yen. Then when we take a look at the U.S. picture, it's a different one this morning than we saw yesterday. Of course, we saw a 5% swing in the S&P 500 from the lows to the highs of the day where we ultimately ended. Today though, after earlier gaining in the future session, we're rolling over. S&P evening is now down about 4.10% of 1%. As we see some buying coming back into the bond market, we're down about three basis points on the 10-year treasury yield 391 is where we trade. Well, at the short end of two year is at 4.42. Finally it is a day of dollar strength. Anna, Bloomberg dollars index trading at 1343 at the moment. Yeah, and you wonder if there's a link between that dollar strength and the stock risk asset weakness that we're seeing now, certainly expressing U.S. futures, Kaylee. This is an expression of yesterday's story on Wall Street, really. We are catching up with Wall Street. We've got European stocks moving higher today at 7.1% in London, up around the same in Paris and a bit less than that in Germany. It's pretty broad base. It's been throughout most of the sectors throughout the last two hours of trading here in Europe. Just as Wall Street was pretty broad base, there's a lot of focus once again though on UK assets. Let's get to some of that. We've got the 30-year yield in here coming down once again. So we're seeing a lot more appetite for UK GILTS this morning. We look ahead to the tender offer, the last of its kind from the Bank of England a little bit later on. So we'll see the size and scale of the Bank of England's intervention. How much are they buying at this point? We've got the 30-year yield down at 4.36% the pound.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2753,2022-10-14 09:05:27
14528," a little bit later on. So we'll see the size and scale of the Bank of England's intervention. How much are they buying at this point? But we've got the 30-year yield down at 4.36%. The pound at 112.70. So the big move in the pound seemed to happen yesterday. An expectation of a U-turn then coming through from the UK government. So we saw big moves in the pound higher yesterday. And we just come off those today. So 112.70 down by around half a percent. Feels like there's some big experiment going on here in the UK about what happens when you pull certain fiscal levers and we hope the rest of the world is taking note. This is what's happening in Hungary at this point. We've seen big moves in the Hungarian currency. This after an announcement by the Central Bank and emergency rate hike by the Central Bank, they've introduced a new one-day deposit rate that's going to be at 18% more than the 13% base rate. And with that, they set off the biggest rally in their currency since 2011. And it is the weakness in their currency that we're trying to get ahead of as instructed by the Prime Minister. He wants inflation down from above 20%. And gas futures, I bring you a slightly better story here, Kaylee. This is nice. 91% storage full in Europe. 95% storage full in Germany. That doesn't tell us how full it will be in February. March, of course, which is important. But also some of the seven-day forecast for weather, some of the longer-term forecast for weather are suggesting that temperatures will be above average through this winter. And so when you're looking for good news, that is it. And as a result, the gas price is down by 4.4%. All right. Anna, bringing the good news on a Friday morning. What's so interesting to me is that yesterday, when we got inflation data, you could have considered that bad news. And yet we got a shock turnaround in equities that sent Wall Street searching for something to explain how another red hot inflation number translated into the best day for bulls in a week. Bloomberg's Danny Berger joins us now with a closer look at yesterday's action. Danny, please explain. I look, Kaylee, I'm going to do my best, but let me just, you know, huge disclaimer on this whole thing. These are really just guesses at the end of the day because we don't know. I really like how Liz and Saunders put it. I mean, this is the nature of the beast these days. Things can turn around on a dime. All right. Let's kind of dig through some of these clues to try to figure out why it turned around and what that means. So yes, we get CPI coming out yesterday in the market. I mean, it just absolutely tanks. Now, it's super easy to blame the algos. Maybe there were some mean reversions levels triggered that started this buying and then trend following just follows on. But again, that's one of those things that's hard to actually ascertain whether it happens. Now, one of the clues is when the market was diving, the VIX was moving lower at this point, too, which is stringent. You'd suggest more market volatility. VIX should move higher, but it does suggest that some hedges were being unwound. So perhaps that's one of the clues of why it eventually turned. Now, a lot of folks have said this was a short covering rally. That's not exactly right. It at least wasn't a plain vanilla short covering rally. And one of the ways we can tell that is by looking at the Goldman Sachs index of most shorted stocks versus that S&P 500, the most shorted stocks underperformed and only gained 1.4% overall index gains 2.6% percent. Usually the most short stocks just absolutely rip on a day of short covering. So clearly, this was not individual stock led. Now, it still could have been short covering, but it would have been moved by something more technical. I know all this is a bit technical, but we had a lot of folks buying puts before yesterday. We had some days of record put buying as well. So if the market tanks puts become profitable, folks trade those in, the dealers on the other side, they're short to market to have a neutral position. And then they need to short covering. So if it's short covering, it was a weird technical one. Now, all this mumbo jumbo is to say that it does look like it was because of market mechanics. So at the end of the day, that fundamental bearish story still not gone. Okay. Danny, thank you so much. That is why she's here to explain the stuff, Danny Berger with us on what was driving markets. I spoke to a guest at Credit Suits. He was saying, yes, she was not convinced that we had turned any kind of material corner with the enthusiasm for risk assets yesterday. Let us get to talking of turning corners. Let us get to UK politics. What could we expect from the Prime Minister Listeras today? Some kind of you turned perhaps. That is what's being reported and is she preparing to abandon a central part of her tax cutting agenda after weeks of chaos in the markets? The Chancellor has cut short his trip to the United States and is heading back to London just hours after insisting he's quote, not going anywhere. Our position hasn't changed. I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week. And there will be more detail there. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2754,2022-10-14 09:10:07
14529," I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October as I said earlier in the week and there will be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. Well, he certainly thinks he's not going anywhere in terms of his job. He's what's going somewhere though, Lizzie, in terms of his travel plans because he left Washington early on his way back to the UK as we speak. Get and Lizzie Birdon, our colleague joins us from Downing Street to take us through the latest. The new turn on corporate tax, corporation tax then, not announced but certainly being talked about by a lot of people. Is that what we expect? Yes, Anna, it's a question of timing now. It seems, if you look at the British Airways flight schedule, it would appear that we can expect Quasicua to land on UK soil around 1040 today. Then you would expect him to come to Downing Street for crisis talks with Liz Truss about when to time it. Now, you would expect that they would announce it before the market open on Monday because of course this U-turn is now priced in. And so they're not going to want to see a sell off at the market open when the Bank of England's emergency bond program, bond buying program would already have been withdrawn. But then the question is, would they actually want a weekend of speculation? Is Truss wanting to speak to her friend Quasicua today and will they announce the decision later today? But really, it's leaving Liz Truss very much elamed up as you say this is another key plank of her economic policy. The idea was to boost growth. So the Times is reporting that the Tories are plotting to change their rules, replace her with Rishi Sunak and Penny Morden who of course ran against her to be the leader. But whoever would take over from Truss would have a severely diluted mandate and judging by the polls you would expect if there had to be a general election Labour would win. OK, Lizzie, you mentioned the bond buying program of the Bank of England ending today is the last day of that. Where does this leave Andrew Bailey and his team? Well, it seems in the game of chicken that he was playing with the Chancellor Quasicua saying, Andrew Bailey has won and it's the Chancellor who is going to have to U-turn. Remember, Andrew Bailey had said that the pension funds had three days to sort themselves out. Implicitly in there, it seemed it was a message to the government to sort itself out. But if the market turmoil continues after today, perhaps we can expect a more creative solution from the Bank of England. I was speaking to former BoE policy maker Martin Wheel yesterday. He suggested they could provide more targeted support for pension funds. So what the Bank of England is going to want to do is get away from the blunt instrument of positive easing so that it can reprioritize inflation fighting over financial stability and stop getting dragged down the path of being dominated by fiscal policy. All right, Bloomberg's Lizzie Burton reporting from Downing Street. Thank you so much. Let's get to corporate earnings now. US banks are set to kick off what will be a very closely watched third quarter earnings season. The Morgan first up this morning in city Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley are all also on deck to report today. Their outlooks will be heavily scrutinized for clues about the state of the industry amid growing recession risk. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond spoke yesterday, offering hints of what his bank is bracing for. I don't know if it could be a soft landing. I don't think so, but it might mild recession or tough recession. My point in the tough recession, yeah, you expect the market under the 20 to 30 percent. I'm not going to keep odds across those three things, but for all of us who have to worry about risk, you have of course you should plan for those things. Shonali Bostic, our global finance correspondent, is joining us now with more. So Shonali, it's not the prettiest picture for these banks. They're facing a lot of headwinds. What are you going to be watching for in these reports? And that's the thing. If Jamie Diamond expects that there won't necessarily be a soft landing and a mild or tough one, then what does that mean for provisioning for loan losses? The expectation right now is about $1.2 billion over at JP Morgan about half of that at Wells Fargo. It's interesting to see what will happen not just on the consumer side, but the investment banking side. It's a rare day that we have four big banks reporting at the same time. So a lot of things to watch between the differences between the type of clients that JP Morgan and city, JP and Wells Fargo have and Morgan Stanley wealth management.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2755,2022-10-14 09:14:09
14530," So a lot of things to watch between the differences between the type of clients that and the Morgan Stanley wealth management clients that may or may not be feeling the same type of pain in the market that some of the other consumers are. Okay, yes, generally for at the same time, that really isn't fair. How does this set us up for the rest of the year then? What do we look out for long term? And those trading desks because even places like rates, commodities, fixed income, some banks are doing very well, Anna, but then if you look at that larger, thick business, you've seen some firms already be burned by mortgages and mortgage trading, for example. So is there more pressure in those businesses that started to create a ballast to some of those other areas that started to see some weakness? Also we're going to see more of the yield curve inversion play a bigger role here. It's kind of offsetting the optimism behind that net interest income gain. All of this is to say this is the end of the year. Bankers will be telegraphing what their staff will be really looking like into next year, whether they'll need to do a little bit more by way of headcount reductions and what they will have to do in terms of efficiency and managing compensation in order to meet lower profitability. Janali, thanks so much. Brinburg, Janali Basak there. With the preview of what to expect from the bank earnings season and we'll have more on US banks and what we expect here from them later this hour with Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, Alison Williams. Coming up on this program, we'll dig deeper into the UK story. Gordon Shannon joins us from 24 asset management, where he's a portfolio manager, playing, carrying the chance to do the X-Checker on his dash back to London, currently somewhere over South Wales on its way to Heathrow. We'll also talk to Jeffrey Yu, BNY Melon, senior market strategist about UK assets, sure, but also about US assets, post US assets, post that CPI print. And it is the 20th Chinese Communist Party National Congress kicking off this weekend. Stick with Bloomberg for special coverage starting on Saturday night and all through the week. Let's go down tickets out. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order? How much we're going to pay them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing. We're 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Hey, so you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have been in聲 it. Lots of Bloombergs. Lots of bloombergs. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen The Bloomberg. I've seen The Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What is it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. The early season is coming. It's pricing for another big unexcaised. Everyone is expecting it to be poor. It has big mark downs on earning.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2756,2022-10-14 09:18:59
14531," the last number is and analysis you trust. This is Booneberg's surveillance early edition. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Kaley Lines in New York. Matt Miller is off today and let's return to the theme one of the themes of the week. And that is around guilt markets for our radio audience. I'll describe the chart we're going to show you a chart essentially of UK guilt and what guilt have been doing. This is the 30 year year, which is extremely topical. That's where the Bank of England has been intervening. That's where the Bank of England has been buying at the long end of the curve. Just before we got that physical plan announced, of course, we saw those yields go higher. They were tracking substantially higher. The Bank of England sets in those yields came down. They started, they started then going up again. And now as we hear reports of a U-turn by the government on those unfunded tax cuts, yields come down. Let's get some market analysis. Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager at 24 asset management. He's here with me in studio in London, Gordon. Very good to speak to you. So we're all waiting to hear what the government has to say later today over the weekend. If we get some U-turn, how big a U-turn do we have to see to calm guilt markets? Is it possible to say? Because there's talk about U-turning on corporate tax, but that's only £18 billion. The IFS says the whole in the physical plan is £60 billion. So does the size matter or is it the signal we're looking for? I think it's the size because the signal is important that the government is finally listening. It appears we've been caught in this game of high stakes poker between the chairman of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, and I'll stress the current Prime Minister, Liz Truss. But what's been forgotten is the other player in this game, the bond market, and the bond market is certainly unhappy with a large unfunded fiscal expansion. Ultimately, guilt investors won't write blank checks. So yes, I think a reversal in the plan to freeze corporation tax alone, I think we'll have to add in the national insurance as well. OK. But that's tough because that one's going to come in next month. OK, so that's a couple of areas where we're looking for some kind of U-turn, or at least that we're thinking that that's where it might fall. What about the preparedness of pension funds and the guilt market for going back to life as normal on Monday? Because if the Bank of England is going to stop its bond buying programme, as it says it will, do we know where the pension funds have taken this time to rebuild collateral? If LDIs, these liquidity driven investments are going to be in a fit state to meet margin calls, how is that going to play out on Monday? From what I've heard, I think that's been handled quite well. The Bank of England did gain a lot of the market's confidence and its intervention. And looking at that chart that we mentioned before, it's guided the market down, allowing it to step down each day in an amount where the LDI schemes were able to raise the appropriate collateral to handle those moves and take us back to roughly fundamentals. I think that the LDI schemes and what I'm hearing now have taken our leverage from around three times at the end of September to one and a half to two times now. They would have come into the year with around 150 to 200 basis points worth of guilt moves collateral for those kind of moves. That was all used up by June, so they were in a precarious position, and then of course the many budget absolutely blew them out of the water. At this point, I think they've rebuilt themselves to having around 300 basis points worth, but they're still trying to get to 400. And to do that, they're continuing to sell risk assets. So that's a negative overhang that will be on top of the market. That's a great detail, Gordon Katie, jump in. Well, Gordon, you're talking about the rebuilding of some of these pension funds. What about the rebuilding of the Bank of England's credibility? How much do they have left? Well, it's been described that Andrew Bailey's gamble, his bluff here has paid off well. I mean, I think that was reckless. I think on Wednesday when he made these bombastic comments about the fact that the buying would end this Friday, that was on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2757,2022-10-14 09:23:07
14532," These bombastic comments about the fact that the buying would end this Friday, that was unnecessary. You could have privately cajoled the LDI schemes to get on with their selling, but he should have allowed a bit more ambiguity in the market. We could be in a different scenario right now where the Bank of England would be forced to continue buying on Monday and then its credibility would have been pushed even lower. Ultimately, controlling inflation is what the Bank of England really needs to get on with. That's why aside from the very short term, I would be fading this move. Well on the controlling inflation, they are going to need higher interest rates to do that. Gordon, it's not even just a question of what the Bank of England ultimately decides to do today with the ending of this program. It's what they do in November. What should they do and what do you think they ultimately will do? So I think they should be hiking by at least 100 basis points and crucially not having that alongside Davish messaging. I think they should be indicating that there will be another 100 at the next meeting and that those hikes won't be getting reversed anytime soon. In reality, I think it's more likely now, especially if we have this U-turn and that's looking more and more likely that we perhaps only get a 75 basis point hike and some Davish noises that perhaps the next one will only be 50 basis points. I think that's nowhere near enough given how sticky UK inflation appears to be. OK, is it rate hikes that are going to bring down inflation, Gordon, or is there room for government to make policy changes here and away from the politics of it, which would be controversial? The labour market is really tight. If they changed immigration rules in some way, that might alleviate the pressure on the labour market, but obviously that has politics attached. What kind of policy choices does the government have? I think first of all, the government could try hard to not make things worse. That would be my first request. But, yeah, the labour market continues to be tight and it's tight for the kind of the worst possible reason. Consumers are continuing to be squeezed, but unemployment is falling, but that's because the inactivity rate, the participation rate, is not rising. There's a lot of people off on long-term health problems. I think that's a hangover from Covid-19. Brexit and the immigration controls have not helped, but this is a global phenomenon. There will be a very lagged impact of any reversal in those. So I don't see any quick way to turn around the tightness in the labour market. And when we're talking about turning things around, there's also an energy shortage and the cost of living crisis that the government is trying to deal with Gordon. What is the optimal policy prescription for that? I mean, ultimately, what really worries me is that governments are running naked shorts on gas prices right now, both in the UK and throughout Europe. And in the same way that we all pretended to be expert, epidemiologists during 2020, I think now everyone will claim that they're an expert in meteorology. And in the next couple of weeks, we should get fairly useful long-term forecasts for what the winter will be like in Europe. And if it's a hard winter, all bets are off. Yeah, Anna was giving us somewhat of a positive meteorological forecast really about me. He was talking about me there, Kayleigh. Yeah, that was my amateur meteorology, but it was based on some reliable sources. It was on the Bloomberg terminal. Ah, yes. And that we know we can trust. Gordon, Shannon, 24-asset management, Fortfolio Manager, thank you so much for joining us. Now, let's get to some other stories and keep you up to date with news from elsewhere around the world with the first word. Twitter's lawyers tried again to learn what Elon Musk had told federal authorities who were investigating his attempt to take the social media company private. According to a letter unscilled in court, attorneys for Twitter sought documents last week related to the Musk investigation. By that point, Musk reversed himself on walking away from the $44 billion takeover, but he and Twitter were still adversaries in court. The Securities and Exchange Commission is deepening its probe into the use of outside messaging services and is now looking into the practice at investment firms as well as at major banks. The SEC has issued about $2 billion in fines to banking giants over the past year for the use of messaging apps such as WhatsApp due to risk around improper conduct, compliance, and record keeping. It's understood dozens of investment firms have now received requests for information from the SEC. The House January 6th Committee has voted to subpoena for our President Trump, while the Houseellers want to question him.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2758,2022-10-14 09:27:15
14533," The investment firms have now received requests for information from the SEC. The House January 6th Committee has voted to subpoena for our President Trump. While makers want to question him about the 2021 attack on the Capitol, and are demanding documents and testimony about his role, the subpoena is an escalation of the Committee's demands to hold Trump accountable for his actions during the assault. And the manager of a $184 billion public pension fund for Texas Public Education employees is cutting its Chinese stock allocation in half. The move potentially cuts billions of dollars. According to meeting documents, teacher retirement system of Texas is switching to a new, tailored emerging market stock benchmark to reduce China's quote, outsized weight in the MSCI emerging markets index it wants relied upon. And and of course, China is very much in focus for us this weekend and into next week as the party Congress is being held. It's a question of the priorities of Xi Jinping and the Communist Party and ultimately, what the feat of the COVID-19 policy is going to be? Yeah, for markets for investors, that's really important. Obviously, the geopolitics between China and the US, also really influential on money managers and their willingness and ability to allocate into China. So certainly we'll keep all of those themes very much in focus. We'll get analysis of what to expect from that Congress a little bit later on this hour. In the meantime, we'll also talk to Jeffrey Yu, someone who might be able to weigh in on strategy towards China. BNY Melon Senior Market Strategies, so much to talk to Jeffrey about today could be a fascinating conversation. Stay with us. Thanks for watching. Apple has identified its next big business bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like Cartier or Ships or Mortgage Lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way and disjowing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snack and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for advertising. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are an Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

14534," Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? Great question. Great question. Best question I get online. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. This is Bloomberg's surveillance early edition. Here's what you need to know. The record reversal, the S&P 500 defies expectations, roaring back from losses sparked by that hot US inflation reading. Asia and Europe joined the rally, but US futures now fade. UK tax U-turn, Prime Minister Liz Truss, prepares to abandon key measures of her economic plan, following weeks of market turmoil, Chancellor Quasic-Warting raises back from Washington. And JP Morgan, City Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley all kick off bank earning season today. With the Fed hikes in focus, Jamie Time in Wands, it's unlikely the central bank can pull off a soft landing. I'm Anna Edwards in London with Kaley Lines in New York. Matt Miller is off today. And Kaley, my sympathies go to bank analysts today trying to deal with full banks reporting. Janali says all at the same time, which sounds like a bit of a handful. In the midst of all of that, we're still seeing strength in risk assets here in Europe, but that fades into the US session. Yeah, it definitely has faded as the future session for all's older. We're still trying to contend with the CPI data we got yesterday. And now we're going to have to contend with earnings season as well. A lot of big banks reporting today, Anna, as you alluded to. So the question really is going to be on the strength of those earnings, and whether or not it can provide any kind of support to an equity market. That is trying to find its footing yesterday as Anna alluded to. We saw a massive turnaround from a 2.4% loss to a 2.6% gain just on an intraday basis. Absolutely wild. But we're seeing a lot of the moves, ultimately, of yesterday reversing this morning, S&P 500 futures down about 4.10% of 1% and even bigger decline for NASDAQ 100 futures, which are down about 7.10% of 1% right around session lows at the moment. While some buying is coming back into the treasury market, it was still a yields update yesterday. Today, though, they are down about 2.5 basis points on the 10-year yield to just south of 392. And it is a day of dollar strength and the Bloomberg dollar index stronger by about 4.10% of 1%. 13.45% is where we trade at the moment and, of course, in foreign exchange, a lot is going to be paid attention to the British pound today in particular. Yeah, absolutely. And it loses ground in contrast to yesterday, Kaylee. Let's check where we are on European assets. Then the stock 600 is up by 7.10% of 1%. Echoing Wall Street of yesterday, if it was some of those market structures that were driving Wall Street higher, then we're happy to make the most of that here in Europe. It seems, and we go a little bit higher across sectors, most sectors in positive territory in the earlier part of the trading session today. Here's a couple of UK assets very much in focus. We're seeing buying of guilt today as we get to the end of the Bank of England's buying program. Today is the last day. This is the 30-year yield we have here. And you can see that the yield is dropping and we are seeing buying then coming back into the markets. The pound, of course, a strong rally yesterday on expectation of a U-turn in government policy. Remember, the unfunded tax cuts were very much the thing that led to markets' home oil in guilt markets and also in the currency. And so we saw a big rally in the pound yesterday on that scene. Maybe the market looking for confirmation of that to maintain those moves today. And we see the pound actually tracking back 7.10% of 1.12% now. Here's another currency very much on the move. This is the dollar losing ground against a resurgent Hungarian forage. And this is because the central bank over in Hungary decided on an emergency policy intervention. They have hyped interest rates. They are tightening policy. Introducing a one-day deposit rate and they are going to offer 18% on that. And contrast to the 13% base rate, the Prime Minister Victor Orbán saying he was not happy with inflation above 20%. The central bank trying to weaken the currency to have some effect on that. All right. So another one, hiking substantially in. Let's talk more about central banks that have to continue on the tightening path. Jeffrey U, BNY, Melon, senior market strategist joins us now. Jeff will get to the UK in just a second, but if we could just begin in the US in the hot inflation print we saw yesterday, the mysterious market rally we got off the back of it. And ultimately, if it changes anything, did it alter at all your expectations for the Federal Reserve? How far they will go? How long they will stay there? I don't think anything has changed at all. What happened yesterday ultimately after CPI was we managed to figure out in hindsight, of course, how long dollars or how long Fed or cushionists so to speak, the market was. Yes, it was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2760,2022-10-14 09:35:59
14535," the report suggesting only the national insurance cuts are going to be maintained and even using the IFS numbers. That can be offset and using wage earnings for the benefit top rate. But politically that's probably quite toxic as well. So if they can scale it back down to say under £20 billion or something like that, it is manageable. I think the guild market will calm down as well. But that doesn't unwind the institutional damage. That's an important point, Jeffrey. Let me ask you then, come Monday, if we see substantial U-turns over the weekend, if we see that coming to pass, will the guild market, I know a lot is unknown as I say that, a lot will depend on the detail. But can you foresee a situation where the guild market is able to stand on its own feet without the involvement of the Bank of England in the way that it's been involved this week? I certainly do. And I think the Bank of England would have been calling pension funds or would have been speaking to LDI Association some throughout the last two weeks. I'm just really checking how much exposure some are, some pretty confident that they do have a situation under control. And never rule anything out in their back stops. There can be new liquidity back stops as well. But we take a leap out of the droggies. The strongest back stops are the ones that never need to be deployed. So with the new liquidity arrangements, perhaps, you know, that does design us such. If further down the line more is needed, the Bank of England will never jeopardize financial stability. That's be clear on that. But yes, Normanda, I do think the guild market can hold its own. Jeff, finally, to circle back to something you mentioned earlier, the question of China, a headline just crossing the Bloomberg terminal, the offshore yuan. Now at $7.21, that is record weakness for the offshore yuan ahead of the party Congress that starts this weekend. And what are the greatest market risks around that event? So there are upside risks and downside risks, right? And I think there were upside risks at this point. Look at the conditioning for zero COVID throughout the week. And it's just an article after article in the leading papers saying zero COVID is here to stay. But if they're like very subtle in a hint of changes in what kind of a policy environment, what kind of a COVID environment, both them for the pandemic, but also for the virus, then I think that would be taken as a strong signal as well. But on the other hand, I think markets also be looking at the makeup of the new leadership group. There's strong expectations. There'll be a strong technocratic element within the new bureaucracy, the new hierarchies. If let's say the share of technocrats is not as strong as previously anticipated, I think that's one area for markets for international observers to reassess them as well. So quite a few moving cards that will take a few days and ultimately, let's see what the lineup is next week. Jeff, thanks so much. Really good to see you. Jeffrey, you are BNY, Mellon. Coming up on the program, earning season, we've mentioned it a few times. The banking sector in focus today, it kicks off today with four major US banks reporting. We'll get an update, a briefing on what to expect next. We'll see you next week. Thank you. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2761,2022-10-14 09:42:45
14536," Build on a foundation strong enough to stay We will never break Have the water rises And the mountains shake All our will will remain We will never No, now we will never No! We believe that all consumers are equal They are not Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg This is Bloomberg Surveillance Early Edition I'm Kayleigh Lines in New York with Anna Edwards and London Matt Miller is off today And he's missing the debut of earning season US banks will be kicking things off today with JPMorgan City Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley All set to report Investors will be paying close attention to their outlooks as the Fed tries to fight inflation without derailing the economy Allison Williams, Bloomberg Intelligence, senior analyst for Global Banks and asset managers is joining us now Up early for us even though clearly Allison is going to be a very busy day for you with four of these guys reporting this morning A lot of headwinds that they're facing Where do you think we could see the most pain showing up for these banks? I think it's probably not pain but it's expected pain and so what we're really looking at is what are the banks going to tell us with their lost provisions Because it's going to be a great quarter and that interest income is going to be really strong Fees are going to be weaker that's been well broadcast so there is some offset there But the question is really next year what is the economy going to look like and that's why we're looking to the lost provisions Because credit is going to be strong we heard Brian Moynihan yesterday and you know in the recent weeks saying how strong the consumer is We consistently have been hearing that from bank management But the lost provisions look ahead and so to the extent that the probability has increased that there's a recession And depending on the depth of that recession That will be reflected in the numbers Well and clearly the recession will ultimately be brought upon by higher interest rates which can help the banks in many ways But there's also areas in which it hurts like mortgages It's near 7% in the US now that could turn off a lot of people from buying who's most exposed to that? It could Well the banks really have over time reduced their exposure to that business So mortgage banking which really focuses on the origination of loans and servicing of those loans It used to be Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Bank America, they really had a huge hold on that market But if you look since the financial crisis they've really cut different parts of that business There's parts of the business that have a lot more regulation so they've sort of gotten out of those parts of the market And so they're really much less exposed Wells Fargo on a relative basis still is much more involved in that business Alison, good to see you so with investment banking and the fees that it generates very much in focus as part of the narrative that you just set out there Is that going to set up a contrast between what we're seeing from Main Street with resilient consumers at least in the short term and then Wall Street on the other Depending on the banks' reliance on those two streams are we going to see different stories? I think that's exactly right so if we look at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley We're going to see very steep revenue declines from a year ago. Both banks are very capital market focused Goldman a little bit more tilted towards trading, Morgan Stanley towards wealth management But we're going to see the biggest revenue declines there Whereas JP Morgan Bank of America, City Group in Wells Fargo, among the banks I cover, are more exposed to interest rates They're going to do much better and then the regional banks which are covered by Herman Chen Those really are going to benefit from the higher interest rates Lone growth is slowing a bit but there still is some loan growth",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2762,2022-10-14 09:47:04
14537," recovered by Herman Chen. Those really are going to benefit from the higher interest rates. Lone growth is slowing a bit, but there still is some loan growth. And provisions, as I said, we're looking towards the future, but credit is pretty strong right now. Yeah, and so tell us what should we look for more specifically, then, Alison, when it comes to that push and pull, I suppose. Net interest income, of course, helping at this point for some of these retail banks, but on the other hand, concerns about whether their consumer base can stand up to recession. It means that the share prices respond in an interesting way sometimes to hire rate expectations. What will you be looking for there? So I would say in terms of the more regional banking side of the business, if you will, the questions are going to be what's happening with the cost of deposits. So we can all see the benefit of higher rates. I think that has really factored into the numbers, but the two questions are one, how fast our deposit cost going to rise as a result of that. And then number two, what is the impact on loan growth, right? So it's great that we have higher rates, but at some point there's a tipping point. Loan growth has started to slow. What is the outlook for next year? What are the demand trends? We have really great consumer spending. Probably going to see that for the next quarter, but how are we thinking about next year? And then for the investment banks, the strong story is going to be fixed income trading. So volatility, as you said, the fees are really down significantly. There's been a dearth of IPOs this year. Due to the volatility, the offset is we're going to have very strong fixed income trading. That's a positive. Again, it's all about the outlook. That investment banking business, what's happening with the pipelines and execution? Things have been stalled for several months now. Will those deals be able to get done? Will they push into next year? Or are we starting to see things start to get pulled? That's going to be the question on the investment banking side. All right, Alison Williams, a Bloomberg intelligence. Thank you for joining us this morning. Best of luck digesting these four bank results today. Thank you so much. And later today, we're going to be hearing from the CFO of Wells Fargo on his bank's results. That's at 4 p.m. in New York, 9 p.m. in London. And meanwhile, I know we have some breaking news out of the UK. Yeah, we do. According to our reporting here at Bloomberg, the UK Prime Minister Liz Trass is going to reverse some economic plans later today. Later Friday. So this just giving us a bit more detail on the timing. We wondered if we'd have to wait for the weekend. Well, now it seems that we are going to hear something of this today. How much quasi-quarting the Chancellor knows about any of this? He's uncertain. He has been coming across the Atlantic over recent hours. Perhaps he has connectivity. We'll see. But his plane yet to land at Heathrow. It's been taken on every twist and turn. You can imagine in that Heathrow landing, that holding pattern that many of us will be very familiar with. So he waits to land at Heathrow and to find out how it's going to be. And to weigh in, of course, and discuss how policy moves forward here in the UK. Meanwhile, the pound at 1,1266.

Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now it's completely innovating the way training is going, completely changing the way recovery is going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a mirage. I'm Kayley Lines in New York with Anna Edwards in London. Matt Miller is off for a long weekend. But before we can get to the weekend, we still have to get through a very busy Friday today. Here's what those events include. The Bank of England Emergency Bond Buying Program is set to end. We have discussed that at length throughout the program. Plus starting in just about an hour's time, US bank earnings will be kicking off with JPMorgan City, Wells Fargo, and Morgan Stanley, all reporting. We'll also be getting some economic data with US retail sales at 8.30 a.m. New York time. And finally, happening this weekend, China opens its 20th party Congress on Sunday. Represonation paying look set to secure another term as party chief and the markets Anna are going to be watching that one very closely. Yeah, absolutely. And pessimism is running high for China's economy heading in to these important events, which is set to take place over the weekend. It's a twice in a decade party Congress investors looking to the leadership gathering to steer the nation out of the current economic slump. Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie joins us here on set in London to talk us through the latest and Tom. Let's start with what we should expect overall, I suppose, from this party Congress. What are the key things we're going to be watching for? Well, just just with the context, this is one of those rare moments where you get insight into the Communist Party of China's thinking. So that's the importance, as you say, every five years, the big speech from Xi Jinping on Sunday. And as you say at a time when we've had a torrid year for Chinese assets and of course the economy as well. So the Chinese, the benchmark, the CSI 300 is down about 22%. The U.S. is down about 11% versus the dollar. And then the economy, the World Bank thinks the Chinese economy will grow just 2.8% this year. For the first time in more than three decades below most of its Asian peers and below that 8.1% that we got yesterday. Last year, I should say, that again within the context, you're looking back to the kind of growth we saw in the 1990s when Chinese economy was a minute. So what we're looking for, we're looking for, of course, any comments from Xi Jinping around the ability to shore up growth. But also the lineup as well at the top of the party, the most powerful met, they all were men, unfortunately, at the Politburo Standing Committee. Because that will give us a sense, that lineup is just how entrenched Xi Jinping's own power is. And what that can tell us then about the tensions that we know exists between the need to reform, stabilize growth versus the focus on security and the borders of China. Well, Tom, you talk of stabilizing growth and we know one of the biggest challenges to the Chinese economy has been the standing by of COVID-0 policy. They have not abandoned that policy despite its detrimental economic impact. And it seems that state media are talking up the idea that that needs to continue even after the party congress is over. What about that? Yeah, absolutely. This will be a, as you point to, a big disappointment for investors and for those hoping that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2764,2022-10-14 09:55:54
14539," needs to continue even after the party congress is over. What about that? Yeah, absolutely. This will be a, as you point to, a big disappointment for investors and for those hoping that you're going to get a major relaxation around COVID-0. You're absolutely right. We've had three, at least three days, where you've had commentaries in state newspapers supporting COVID-0. You've also had the hiring of COVID-0 officials in Shanghai on two-year contracts, which, of course, many people are reading into in terms of the timeframe. A number of people think it's not going to be relaxed significantly until at least the second half of next year. So that is a major hindrance. In fact, you've seen a flare-up of COVID cases. And in the case of Shanghai, a number of schools and other businesses have been closed down. Any commentary on that will be looking for as well. But there is not an expectation you're going to get a dramatic change on COVID-0. Also looking for anything on the property sector we've been talking about, the headwinds facing that sector. There have been some measures to try and put stimulus into the real estate market. A lot of that will depend on COVID-0 as well. But anything that's incremental will be looked for on that front. And then, of course, US-China tensions. We saw those additional restrictions on tech shares or at least chip sales into the Chinese market. What the Chinese response is going to be if they double down on spending on R&D, for example, will also be closely scrutinized. OK, Tom, thanks so much. Shablinbex, Tom McKenzie, with the latest on what we should watch for at these important Chinese meetings. Kaley, we should just take a moment to reflect on what we've heard about the UK this hour and what we still get to here. We had confirmation then from our reporting that we are going to get some kind of U-turn on fiscal policy today. It is going to come today. We aren't going to wait for the weekend. And interesting that the Times newspaper in the UK is reporting that that will involve plans to freeze corporation tax being reversed. And that has been widely anticipated as one of the moves that they could do to go back on their mini budget. The problem, though, Kaley, is that that's worth about 18 billion pounds. And the IFS, the Institute for Physical Studies, says the whole in the budget is 60 billion pounds. So whether that's enough, whether other measures will follow is going to be a key question. Absolutely. How ultimately is all of this going to be paid for? Anna, and it strikes me that they are going to make these U-turns today as we see the ending of the BOE's emergency bond buying program that today is the last day of that. Andrew Bailey has made that very, very clear. So a lot for UK assets to consider the 30-year guilt yield right now down 20 basis points on the day. Yeah, absolutely. So the guilt market has been responding to expectations of a U-turn. And the pound actually was a little bit, was a lot stronger yesterday on that same expectation. A little bit weaker today at 112.43. But we have seen expectations of U-turns building in the market, Kaley, in recent days. That is it for early edition. Surveillance is still ahead. This is Linbeck. Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in to work with us to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform.

14540," because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform probabilities are they're not all non-securities. Now there's another issue that's just arisen which is called gamification which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies, revenues, rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification, it's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. This is Bloomberg State Breaks. Welcome to DeadBreaks Australia. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. This is going to monitor policy appeared to be moving in completely opposite directions. The Bank of England is having to try and manage the chaos that the government has been creating in the bond market. What we had in UK is symptomatic of what is happening elsewhere. For the Fed, they're strapping themselves in for this. They're expecting some increase in volatility because the world is uncertain. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Bramow is going to explain what happened yesterday. I've got no idea. Live from New York City this morning. Good morning. Good morning for our audience worldwide. I'm going to introduce Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio. J.P. Morgan kicking off bank earnings here on Wall Street. Bramow, should we start with yesterday? Yes, let's. Would you like to explain yesterday for the audience worldwide, please? People say it was technicals because they have no other explanation for it. They're basically some people saying that it hit the point of a 50% retracement since the gains of the post pandemic. And that was suddenly a bi-trigger for the algorithms. Say what you want to do. It's a messy market. Where is the compass for what's actually meaningful in a market that makes no sense? Jordan Rochester was in a morrow with a quote at the top of his note this morning. It reads as follows. If it doesn't smell right, it probably isn't. Yes, I love that. That's how a lot of people felt at the close yesterday, the two year, through 450 in yesterday's session. Now, typically, if you tell me where the bond market is, I can guess where the equity market finished. That wasn't the case yesterday. Yet, it was responded in the way we expected them to respond to that CPI print. The equity market did not. The equity market was one of the only markets that did not respond in the way that you would expect it to respond. I think that's notable. You saw the dollar gain. You're seeing the dollar continue to gain today anyway. You saw, although briefly, you did see some stability in terms of the dollar globally, which perhaps some people said also could have been the trigger. I'm not going to speculate. But still, you are seeing, in March, the terminal Fed funds rate, 4.9% is what's currently priced into the market. To give you a sense of how aggressive people are pricing in this Federal Reserve, I'm not sure where the optimism is that we saw. This massive U-turn in markets, U-turn. So the attention shifts this morning. We'll go away from CPI for a moment. We'll go through the bank earnings, retail sales a little bit later. We've got to talk about the UK as well. Chancellor Quartan is no longer in DC. On his way back to the UK, I understand he might have landed in the last few minutes or so. The UK's Prime Minister, Liz Truss, according to our reporting, is set to reverse some of the economic plans later today. Never mind in a couple of weeks' time. This could happen later today. My favorite articles about this are an explanation of when reporters saw Andrew Bailey in the hallway and said, what's going to happen today? And he just smiled. You know, I mean, he kind of knew. And how much did he win? Right? I mean, who is going to be? Who is going to blink? He didn't blink. And not only that, but in some manner, he is actually forcing fiscal discipline on a government that did not want to behave or adhere to what the market was saying. We'll head down to Washington and just a moment of catch up with Tom Keane down in DC to get the latest on a lot of this. Right now, futures are negative by only two tenths of 1% setting the tone early on this morning will be.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2766,2022-10-14 10:04:51
14541, Mark it was saying we'll head down to Washington at just a moment of catch up with Tom Keane down in DC to get the latest on a lot of this right now futures are negative by only two tens of 1% setting the tone early on this morning will be JP Morgan then we'll run through all the earnings in just a moment then you've got retail sales a little bit later look at the bond market yields coming today but I can tell you on the week for an 11th consecutive week the 10 year yield is climbing higher on the session with down about four basis points or so Lisa 390 55 yeah the CPI data was not a comforting for anyone particularly with respect to core with it coming at the hottest level in 40 years as you said today bank earnings very much in focus not just for the banks but as a kickoff to the overall earnings season how well our consumers hanging in there and it's a good thing or a bad thing your to date you've seen a real varied performance across the board in terms of which banks have performed you see JP Morgan down more than 30% yesterday I just want to point out yesterday you saw a massive gain in all of these shares again why I'm not sure again try to make a narrative out of this good luck to you I'm not going to do it but down the line you see Wells Fargo down only 12% perhaps because it didn't have as far to go Morgan Stanley down 20% year to date and city group down nearly 30% also today September retail sales at 8 30 a.m. our consumers continuing to spend it's going to be messy because of what happened with the hurricane down in Florida and University of Michigan October sentiment index at 10 a.m. it's mattering again I expect this to actually be significant and I can see your face John I'm just smiling I'm just happy it's Friday because it's not ever here I don't ever want to hear about the University of Michigan survey again I'm curious to see whether you start to see it roll over a little bit just based on what we're seeing with respect to gasoline prices starting to tick up again and today we do have a bunch of Fed speak I care about Fed speak today okay first reaction to CPI Governor Waller and cove yep Kansas City Fed President Esther George Fed Governor Lisa Cook and Fed Governor Chris Waller really you're interested what do you want to see I want to see what Governor Waller's going to say about that print he's been pretty hawkish on the board I think he's been a bit of an outlier in some sense but a lot of people have had to catch up with his view down in DC and I want to be pushes it even further for me yesterday wasn't about the November decision it was about the news conference with chairman pal could he lay the groundwork for a downshift in heights from 75 to 50 to 25 could be really difficult now how do they set the stage for December these guys wanted a string of decelerating inflation prints to give them some kind of convincing idea that maybe we're heading back towards two they're not getting it well and right now that's the reason why you're getting a nearly 5% terminal rate being priced into Fed funds futures how much is that going to go above that as you start to see some of these sticky components you see the sticky component of the CPI that that increased at the most going back to the 1980s so it's not just sort of the temporary aspects the sticky aspects that are going to persist did you see the administration they now want you to include gas prices went through the summer and last year they wanted to strip out the bits and they emphasized the headline rather than core and early in the year they emphasized core over headline how do you let politicians just drive me nuts no one knows that headline out of the UK are reporting list trust the prime minister hold a press conference on the UK economy later on today down in Washington DC at the International Monetary Fund is our good friend Tom Kean TK the chance there's no longer there I know you had eyes on the governor a couple of minutes ago set the scene for us down in Washington as we look ahead to the UK and what's about to happen in London a little bit later with our question and most interesting meetings since 2008 John Absick's shortening John let me paint quickly here because of time is short the picture yesterday I've got the Bloomberg on my iPhone and I'm showing the managing director of the IMF the 11 basis point move in the 10 year real yield at the 1.69 she and her entourage were silenced this is before our discussion as we did this John behind us was the chancellor setting up for his interview with the BBC which again moved the markets there before he exited across the Atlantic Ocean that's the movement here that's very fluid will speak with Raga Rajan of both school and of course his extreme expertise on emerging markets in his India and get a go up on that we'll join this as well you know the first questions on inflation are looking forward to it Tom just a final question for you before we catch up with you again later on in the show Mohammed Ali and started the conversation this week and he said we've got a global problem that requires a global solution do you get the sense that we're heading that down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2767,2022-10-14 10:08:59
14542," before we catch up with you again later on in the show. Mahamad Alarion started the conversation this week and he said we've got a global problem that requires a global solution. Do you get the sense that we're heading in that direction down in Washington this week? This is the heart of the bait. I was having a beverage of my choice yesterday, John. And this was the key thing. The word accord from John Lipsky. John Lipsky does not see the elements of a cord that are necessary to get that global solution. It's a Bremmer meeting, John. It's every nation for itself. Hey, Tom. Great word this week, sir. As always, good to catch up, buddy. Tom Keane, Dan in Washington, we'll catch up with TK a little bit later. We're not getting that global solution to a global problem anytime soon, aren't we, Lisa? We knew that, though. I mean, nobody was going to say that we were going to get that until the pain really starts defeated into the US. And right now, if anything, it's helping, at least when it comes to overall inflationary pressures. I'm curious about retail sales a little bit later. Does that just confirm that story of underlying strength that this Fed just needs to do a whole lot more? My concern is, and this is somewhat new, I'm not going to get into it right now, is that you are seeing the upper income individuals and households continuing to spend and spend even more lower income, much more constrained. You're getting very different stories depending on which bracket you look at. Joining us right now is Marke Patel, Senior Portfolio Manager at All Spring Global Investments. Marke, first question, unfortunately, it's the, the awful one I start to show with. What an earth happened yesterday. Oh, I think it was a typical short-term traders rally, even though the numbers were bad, you could look at and say, well, here and there, there are numbers which suggest inflation is rolling over. So maybe the Fed will backpedal not be so aggressive. I don't think that's what the Fed is going to do, but I think that's what the market thought. And the market is really all about short-term trading swings, nothing about fundamentals. It's only about what does the Fed go to do and hand to capping that. Marke, how has your view changed to over the past couple of months as you do start to get more of these short-term trading swings and you start to get read after read, highlighting the persistence of this inflation? Well, I think the market has been dominated by this very short-trade swings from companies, from sectors back and forth reacting. Again, it all comes back to the Fed. People trying to hand to cap what the Fed is going to do. So it hasn't changed very much. I think that the Fed is guiding light, is basically looking at the unemployment rate, which looks terrific. So they feel they can continue to aggressively tighten, aggressively self-securities, and things are all right because the unemployment rate is low. And so I think that's why the market will once again overreach because it's looking really at that. Unemployment still looks good, and that's what they're going to focus on. And so no change. I think the Fed is going to continue to be on this path for quite a few months. Does this mean that you're hiding out in cash? No, I think that basically equity still look very attractive because maybe one day the Fed will say, well, let's, we've done enough here. Let's stand back, compromise with inflation in the interests of growing the economy. And also the very strong dollar, that says to me more than anything, that tells you the strongest economy in the world is manifested in the strengths of the dollar. So I think the US is still a good place to be. If you're invested, you'll be there in the bottom, which will come one day. Hey, Markey. Great to catch up, as always. Markey, it's out there of all spring, global investments, trying to make sense of the last 24 hours. And I think a lot of people struggling to explain what happened yesterday. I think the first five minutes made sense, right? That's the thing about this market. If you don't like the price action, wait 60 seconds. I think that's the right. That's right. Yeah, the explanations were kind of fun. I read through some of the commentary. It basically was like, this is technical, the algorithms, they don't know anything. This doesn't make sense. Ignore it. Perhaps this is persistence. It shows that there's still money in the market. All the explanations are basically, don't listen to it. But then how do you position around that? How do you have a long-term view, if short-term trading signals are not giving you information that is reliable? What is the ballast? What is the compass? I really spent a lot of time thinking about that last night. Does it all come back to the dollar? Is that really the tail that waggs the dog? Sure. I think for a lot of people it is. The other question I've been asking at the moment, short-term versus long-term, is whether we've seen some kind of secular shift, away from the old regime, to a, I use the word permanent loosely.

14543," Globalization nice and this question of reshoring is going to have a more persistent inflationary tilt that has not necessarily been factored into the secular kind of low growth low inflation environment and that I think is the key change that was super philosophical. Thanks. We'll get philosophical about the UK in just a moment. Your 30-year-old is down 26 basis points. We'll catch up with a former chancellor who lived the mess of the early 1990s. That conversation up next. Keeping you up to date with news from around the world with the first word. I'm Lisa Mateo. Germany's defense minister says NATO allies must take Russian threats to use nuclear weapons and its war on Ukraine seriously. But should not let them disrupt international efforts to support the government and Kiev. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any nation that interfered in his invasion of Ukraine would suffer, quote, consequences that you have never experienced in your history. His comments widely seen as threatening a nuclear strike. UK chancellor, Zeshakir, quasi-quartang, left IMF meetings in DC early to rush back to the UK. Prime Minister Liz Truss' administration is preparing to abandon a central part of its tax cutting agenda. Trucks has come under pressure for her own party to restore Britain's economic credibility after the fallout from their fiscal proposals. And US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a video shot during the January 6 insurrection that she wanted to punch President Trump if he showed up at the Capitol. A video released by CNN shows Pelosi in her office says the Capitol is about to come under assault. In the footage, Pelosi says, quote, my hope he comes out. I'm going to punch him out and I'm going to jail and I'm going to be happy. Lawmakers want to question Trump about the 2021 riot and our demanding documents and testimony about his role. The move comes just weeks ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transformed something that was dependent on fossil fuels. It uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art.

I will come up with the medium-term fiscal plan on the 31st of October, as I said earlier in the week, and there'll be more detail there. What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not getting anywhere. I guess if you've done a 180 on the previous plan, and you do a 180 again, that your position hasn't changed, right? Because you just go back to the old plan. It doesn't really work like that in politics. Just going to throw that out there. I think that there is some reputation or damage along the way. I think that's what he's trying to say. That was the chancellor in the last 24 hours. That chancellor has landed back in the UK, because the UK has had some problems over the last couple of weeks. Right now, the 30-year-old in the guilt market is down by 25 basis points. The telegraph in the UK reporting the following. The Prime Minister lit stress will hold a news conference at 2pm today. This is the line I think that's going to get a lot of interest. The corporation tax will rise to 25% from 19%. Lizzie Byrdon outside of the Bank of England, and outside of number 10 down in street forests in the last couple of weeks. Right now, outside number 10, Lizzie, let's start with number 10. What's about to happen a little bit later? Well, it's a complete UE. You turn here. They're going back to Boris Johnson's plan to raise corporation tax from 19%, 25%, giving up one of the main planks of trussonomics, which was an intended to boost growth. And it became inevitable yesterday when the market's priced it in. Of course, Quartan rushed back from Washington in the early hours. It's been compared to when the Greek finance minister left the G20 in 2011, although his allies have shung that comparison. And really, in the game of chicken between the chancellor and the BLE Governor Andrew Bailey, it seems to be Quartan who's blinked first. Bailey looks like he can uphold his promise to end the BLE bond buying programme today. But we are expecting this press conference from Liz Truss later on, and hope that it will calm the markets. One sources comment was, people are petrified of the markets. I was reading this yesterday in the financial times. Lizzy, how much is this entirely a market driven response where they are trying to come a market when Andrew Bailey is backing away and gave the government three days? Yes, he was also giving, perhaps, pension fund managers three days. But really, it was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2770,2022-10-14 10:22:11
14545," on to where they are trying to come and market when Andrew Bailey is backing away and gave the government three days. Yes, he was also giving perhaps pension fund managers three days, but really it was the trust administration. Exactly. And Mark Carney, the former B.O.E. Governor at the IMF, said that bad policy would be punished by the markets and yet again, quasi-quarting and Liz Truss are having to learn that lesson. This may just be the second of many more U-turns because of course the government needs to plug a 60 billion pound hole in the public finances. That's according to the Institute for Physical Studies estimates. She's already said this week that she's not prepared to cut public spending, although there are hints at efficiency savings and we all know what that U for this means. But even if they reverse this corporation tax freeze, she's still not going to plug the 60 billion pound gap, it will save about 13 billion a year. So there's much further to go. And then you have to ask, what's the point of having Liz Truss if she can't get the central planks of Trussonomics through? She's a Prime Minister who is in office but not in power. And today the Times is reporting that the Tories could change their rules so that she could be replaced with Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordant who of course ran against her to be the leader. But whoever took over from her would have a seriously diluted mandate and they'd be therefore pressured to call a general election. And by the looks of the polls at the moment, it looks like Labour would win. Let's see, thank you. This one's a struggle to keep up with, isn't it? Lizzy Burden outside number 10 for us. I thought this morning we'd be talking about the Bank of England and the expiry of the guilt market operation Lisa, but the attention firmly on the other side of London. Yes, because basically, Andrew Bailey won and they are going to give some of creeds to this. How much then do we see yields continue to come down? And will this be enough? We'll see. Let's catch up with the man who lived the mess of the early 1990s, the former UK Chancellor, Lord Norman Lamont. Lord Lamont, fantastic to catch up with you, sir. I want to borrow the words of Lizzy Burden, my colleague there. Do we have a Prime Minister in office but not in power? I beg your pardon, I didn't hear that. Do we have a Prime Minister in office but not in power? Well, that is a quotation from myself, that phrase in office but not in power, which was a phrase I used to describe the position of the major government. I think probably we do have a situation like that because it is deeply humiliating what has happened. It is a real mess. I hope that what is about to be announced will calm the markets but I'm rather skeptical about it because it is only a part of the package that needs to be reversed. I think you either have to have public expenditure cuts or all the tax cuts will have to be reversed. It is a really a very, very awkward situation and a very humiliating situation. Lord Lamont, given that you think that perhaps a full reversal could but may not really grieve some more credence to this administration, do you think that there needs to be a new administration, new leadership to this particular parliament? Well, I think perhaps up to members of parliament what we definitely need is stability. I think MPs need to be conscious not just of whether the Conservative Party can recover in time for the general election but we need to remember that this is being watched by the world and this is not a very good advertisement for the country. How concerned are you about the pound given the structural damage with respect to the U-turns? You can even call them U-turns maybe switchbacks from this administration. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's leave it there. I appreciate your time. Lord Lamont, it seems like our connection has gotten lost. Lord Norman Lamont, thank you so much. But John, this highlights the concern at a moment where it's very difficult to really understand how they can restore credibility with the pound, with markets that are incredibly skeptical of their of their of their plans. Unfortunately, we lost the former chancellor there because this is a man who lived it in the early 1990s when Sterling dropped out of the ERM. The question that we've been asking is whether there will be scars left on Sterling to denominated assets where you'll have to bake in some kind of risk premium, not permanently, but perhaps for a period of time because this is playing out now and maybe they have a U-turn,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2771,2022-10-14 10:26:30
14546," You can see it's not only in the United assets where you'll have to be in some kind of risk premium. Not permanently, but perhaps for a period of time because this is playing out now and maybe they have a you turn but have they completely lost credibility to your point. Where by the evening they unwrap and walk back all of this stuff the bank of England still needs to do more than it otherwise would have had to do when it meets nearly November. And so they were in a state of the state of the state of the state. They did this emergency program to kind of plug the gap but they haven't turned on the queue on quantitative tightening. They're continuing to go with the rate hikes. On the flip side how much has to be done with respect to policy that might not have had to be done to your point more fiscal discipline than they even would necessarily have had to do in order to restore credibility to the state of the state. So, I think that's a good example and strong yield to been climbing all over the place. And when I asked the question earlier this week of course I had my own answer to it. What surprises you more? What's been announced or how the market responded to it? For me it's how the market responded to it. To see this market this fragile and response to 45 billion pounds worth of tax cuts is pretty amazing. And if you flip it on its head how much of a plan on the fiscal authorities? I think we're seeing that this week, aren't we? In a big way. We're going to catch up with Gerard Cassidy the head of US Bank Equity Strategy at RBC Capital Markets. A little bit later this morning.

It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. I'm told that quasi-quarting is being sacked as Chancellor as Liss Truss prepares to reverse the mini budget. Not clear who will be replacing him. Events moving very, very quickly this morning. Number 10. Not commenting. British politics is absolutely brutal and severe. And you're about to see some of that play out today possibly. Especially with the finger pointing of who takes the blame for this. Can Liss Truss preserve her reign by basically throwing quasi-quarting under the bus? A couple of weeks on the job. This comes from the political editor of the Times in the United Kingdom out of London. Exclusive. I'm told that quasi-quarting is being sacked as Chancellor as Liss Truss prepares to reverse the mini budget. Outside number 10, get on the street. Lizzie Verden. Lizzie, the headlines keep rolling in. I don't know if you just caught the look on my face, John. But this is a huge moment for Liz Truss because quasi-quarting is one of her close friends, her neighbour in southeast London in Greenwich and her political soulmate. Over the course of the past 12 years, they've been joined at the hit. They wrote together Britannia unchained this manifesto calling for tax cuts and deregulation. That was the blueprint for this budget that today we find out Truss is going to announce. She's going to reverse huge suites of and it leaves her an extremely lame duck in office but not in power. And you have to ask how much longer she can cling onto power. The Times has also reported today that the Tories are going to change their rules so that she can be replaced with Penny Morden and Rishi Sunak. But if either of them took over, they'd still have a severely diluted mandate and they'd have to, they'd be massive pressure for an election. Lizzie, I'd love your thoughts on what we understand so far. We started this report yesterday that we'd get some form of U-turn from the budget announced just a couple of weeks ago with the fiscal announcement. Can you tell me how much of that is actually going to get walked back? Is it just the corporate tax component of it or is it everything? Well, the Financial Times is reporting that it's going to be even more of it and it would make sense because Truss has said in Prime Minister's questions that she's not going to make spending cuts, which of course would be difficult in the first instance because George Osborne has Chancellor picked most of the low-hanging fruit under austerity but also politically ugly in a cost of living crisis. There was also speculation that she would try to raise benefits only in line with earnings instead of inflation to try to incentivise people back into work. But again, ugly because on the main form of welfare, Universal Credit, 38% of recipients are in work and again, we're in a cost of living crisis. So if you put the spending cuts aside, it leaves U-turns on the tax cuts. We've already had the massive U-turn on the top rate, then the corporation tax seems to be the next. And then you've got the rest to come today. But really, as I say, what's the point of having Liz Truss in number 10?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2773,2022-10-14 10:34:59
14548," And then you've got the rest to come today. But really, as I say, what's the point of having Liz Truss in number 10, if Trussonomics can't get done, but wasn't it always inevitable, given that she was, yes, the party membership's choice for leader, but not MP's choice, because they actually wanted Rishi Sunak. But what's pushed her to this point is the markets. And as Mark Carney said, the markets will punish bad policy, and finally, she's learning that. Can Liz Truss blame Quasi Quartei entirely for this? No, because, as I say, they have been joined at the hip throughout these are her ideas. You can see the roots of these ideas in her writings over the past few years. There's no surprise that this is what Liz Truss wanted to do. She told us day in, day out throughout the leadership campaign that from day one, what she was going to do, were tax cuts. And they have gone down so badly with markets. I mean, the other problem of why this hasn't been able to have market credibility is because they have outcast Tom Scholler, the top civil servant at the Treasury. They have sidelined the office for budget responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, and throughout Quasi Quartei's time as Chancellor, he's been almost flippant about the markets. Remember, he said that they all react as they will. Other ministers, him included, have said that what's going on in the markets is due to the international context, the war in Ukraine, Fed, Hikes, Dollar Strength. But anyone with a Bloomberg terminal can see that there has been a particular quarting effect on top. But as I say, it's not just a quarting effect, it's very much also a Truss effect. And that leaves the problems, even if she cuts out quarting from the picture. Hey, Lizzy, great work, great reporting. Lizzy Burden there, outside number 10. What do James Campbell say? I'd come back as the bond market. Yeah, exactly. This bond market's back in a big, big way. We've heard it from a few guests, including Mohamed Daler in this week, on this programme and in a Bloomberg opinion column. And the vigilantes have claimed a couple of names already. And basically, who's next? Right? And at what point will you see this start to impose some sort of restriction in terms of how much debt, a number of different nations. So I also want to raise though that this comes at a time when you have a lot of nations that want to plug fiscal gaps by selling debt. I'm thinking of Germany in particular. So this is a real tension, especially when some of these spend expenditures are considered necessary. So we've had the reports we want the news now, don't we? We've had the reports that will get this news conference a little bit later at 2pm in the UK. We've had the reports from the times this morning that the chancellor is going to get sacked. Now we need the news. I said to Lizzie, I want to understand how much of that budget actually gets walked back. Is it just one component of it, the corporation tax, or is it everything? Or 45 billion sterling worth? Right. So in other words, if they don't walk back everything, and then the bond market revolts, do they then have to walk back more and fear losing even more credibility in the process? I suspect that's not the situation they want to be in a week or so. You'll do right now down about 25 basis points on a 30 year to 4.29. A little bit later this morning, we'll be focusing on one thing, bank earnings. JP Morgan is just around the corner. Gerard Cassidy joined us right now, the head of US bank equity strategy and large cap bank analyst at RBC capital markets. Gerard, let's go there first of all to JP. What are you looking for from Jamie Dimon's big bank? John, I think what we have to look for is obviously how they doing in their investment banking and capital markets businesses. But more importantly, since those numbers have been guided to by many of the big banks and investment banking business revenues could be down as much as 50% year over year, trading revenues could be flat to down. But it's the nid interest margin. As you know, you've been talking about it all morning about interest rates. The rise in the Fed funds rate has been very favorable to JP Morgan and his peers and it's the margins that have expanded. The other thing we're going to watch very carefully though with JP Morgan is their capital levels. Those rising long-term interest rates have hit their bond portfolio as a large g-sub bank. This company has to take that unrealized loss not only for their capital, but their regulatory capital. That will be another point that we're going to focus in on. And lastly, of course, the low-moss reserve build up under Cecil. Um.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2774,2022-10-14 10:39:38
14549," And lastly, of course, the Lomos Reserve build up. Under Cecil, current expected credit loss accounting, they're going to have to build up that Lomos Reserve this quarter. J.J.R.R.D., I'm curious to understand exactly the context that Jamie Diamond was speaking in yesterday when he said, I don't know if it could be a soft landing talking about the U.S. economy. I don't think so, but it might. He said in a tough recession, you could expect the market to go down under the 20 to 30%. J.J.R.D., what's the signal from these sort of dire proclamations from the CEO of J.P. Morgan? I think what we're seeing is obviously, based on history, this type of action by the Fed would lead to a slow down slash recession as he pointed out. And we have some history, of course, back in the 80s when inflation was like this. And none of us have been in that market, you know, trading and looking at stocks in such an high inflationary period. So it's really unusual. The other unusual period here is what they did during the pandemic. I like to say that they threw the economy off-kilter with all of that stimulus, and we're still off-kilter. So there are many cross-currents going on right now, and we see that with the economic numbers that we look at on a jelly basis. J.J.R., I'd look forward to breaking down these numbers with you. Joe Acacity, there of RBC, Capitol is going to be with us in just a moment on the J.P. Morgan numbers. I think you asked the brilliant question, and you're right. What Jamie Diamond says about the macro situation in the U.S. economy, is that a man who sees the same situation in his bank right now? Or is that just an independent thought about where we go in? But that's really what's key in terms of interpreting and already seeing that to some degree. What does that mean for their revenues? How can he generate enthusiasm to go out there and do banking at a time when he's experiencing, or expecting to experiencing something quite negative? I had to spin in this week, and it's spinning if you're just looking at the UK as well right now. Guy Johnson, it's just ran over to a camera for us in the city of London. Guy, great to catch up with you, buddy. Let's just start with what you're expecting to hear at 2PM local time a little bit later. It's going to be a big U-turn. I don't think we'll get the details. Maybe we won't get the details today of exactly what the U-turn does look like in terms of the ultimate tax policy here. We have a pounder as responding to a tweet from the time suggesting that Quasi Quahtang is likely to no longer be imposed. It looks like his decision to rush back may have been to find himself with an announcement that he is going to be leaving. He clearly made a taxical error, maybe going to Washington at this moment in time, John. But I don't think, do we have a well thought out economic policy that is going to be announced this afternoon? This was a government that came in promising massive supply side reform. It has not been able to deliver that growth agenda. Now what? It doesn't have a mandate for anything, and we are unlikely to see a clearly well thought out plan this afternoon. They will not dare, John, to do anything that is going to expose them to the danger of the OBR saying that this is problematic. They are not going to go anywhere near that. But I'm not expecting a clearly sort of coherent well thought out plan this afternoon. But you just know who's going to be the new chancellor of the Exchequer there, OBR to get one. I'm not sure who wants to be the chancellor in this government right now, Guy. This party is doing terribly in the polls. Are the knives out for the leadership right now? How quickly can this Conservative party move to change leadership? So changing leadership in the form of the chancellor, relatively straightforward, changing leadership in terms of Theresa May, I would have thought extremely hard. The British public will not tolerate. It is unlikely that the British public will tolerate another change at the top of the Conservative party. That basically means that you are left with Liz Truss in post as Prime Minister, but with no authority, John. And we could be in for two years, therefore, of chaos. This will make Theresa May's term look well-organised and well run. Hey, Guy, you and I are going to catch up next time around the time that Liz Truss is going to speak.

Elon Musk warned SpaceX cannot help carry the cost of high-speed broadband internet for Ukraine indefinitely. This comes after an earlier dispute over his public comments suggesting the government and Kiev seed territory in exchange for peace with Russia. Musk says the Starlink terminals deployed in Ukraine are using data as much as 100 times the amount of typical households. A week ago, he tweeted that Starlink in Ukraine had cost SpaceX $80 million. And Twitter's lawyers tried again to learn what Musk had told federal authorities who were investigating his attempt to take the social media company private. According to a letter unsealed in court, attorneys for Twitter sought documents last week related to the Musk investigation. By that point, Musk reversed himself on walking away from the $44 billion takeover, but he and Twitter were still adversaries in court.

14552," That's what's really supporting the higher level of provisions. They came in slightly above expectations, but that's this low-loss reserve buildup that based on this new accounting, the banks are doing this quarter. But what this shows you is that banks can handle the buildup of reserves because the margins are coming in better than expected due to the rise in short-term interest rates. How much do you sort of understand their fears of the future, as we've heard from JP Morgan reiterating his concern about the next couple of quarters? How well can these banks withstand it and continue with some of the profits and perhaps show that their evaluations are a little bit under where they ought to be? It's really interesting because the fear going into next year, of course, is that there could be a real steep downturn and credit costs could come in much higher than people are expecting. However, what this quarter is showing us is that the banks can handle the higher credit costs because of these spreads. So as we go into the fourth quarter and next year, even if the economy really does slow down, as Jimmy Diamond is indicating, we think that based upon the core businesses of commercial banking, these banks are going to be able to handle these higher credit costs because of these wider spreads. We're looking right now, shares are continuing to climb up now more than 2% as people digest these earnings. Gerard, how much are you looking at the banking side of things and the weakness that we've seen in equities? The strength for the time being an investment banking with respect to JP Morgan's results, but still this feeling that deals are slowing and are going to continue to slow. That is the real critical part today with the banks. The traditional banking businesses have taken in cheap core deposits, not having to pay up for those deposits, and making loans is the business that is working today. The investment banking and trading businesses, as you pointed out, have been weak all year with the uncertainties in the marketplace. We cannot count on them really being very strong in the fourth quarter or going into your early part of next year. So the banks that have more traditional businesses of taking deposits and making loans are going to do quite well. The regional banks that don't have exposure to the capital markets, other ones that will probably be the leadership in the bank stocks over the next quarter or two. Joe Hanksite, sit tight. Shnali, what you make of that headline? The quarter included net investment securities losses of $959 million. That's a serious number. And you know what? It's not going to be the only one you see. The thing about it, again, we've been talking about it. That's the end of the third quarter. Things have gotten worse since then. I think not only JP Morgan, but especially Morgan Stanley, which is so exposed to Twitter, are going to have to answer questions about how much worse things have gotten since the end of the third quarter. And what they'll really have to take in losses. These are marked to market losses. So what exactly is going to be on their books? And how are they going to be transparent about that you talked about Twitter? Do you expect to have some real sense of what the commitment there is about what hung bridge loans are on their books about just in terms of what they're planning to sell and what they're going to hang on to and hopes for a better day? It's a great question because Lisa, to your point here, they can't sit there and often name single name clients here. But these are massive deals that everyone in the market already knows about. So how they're going to handle the discussion around this is very interesting. And frankly, what's also interesting about this is the way that the buy side has stepped up and say, hey, let us take your loans off your books. That's for you. I'm sure they've left some of that interest. For what? For what price? Exactly. Gerard Cassidy of ABC Capital Markets Gerard, just want to find a word from you, sir. You've gone over the numbers. You're looking through to the rest of the banks today and into next week. What's your take away? The takeaway, John, is what we were expecting, which was the strength and net interest revenue growth due to the margin expansion is going to be able to cover up higher costs and other parts of the bank. You guys just talked about the write down of the bridge loans. That number, almost a billion dollars, was included in the total revenue numbers, and they still beat on revenues. So the strength of this net interest revenue, which John, we haven't seen in 15 years, and this is really the story for the third quarter. It can handle the higher costs of building up loan loans reserves, possibly weakness in investment banking. And I think that's why the stock is up in pre-market trading today. Gerard, you're on the best. Thanks for being with us, sir. Gerard Cassidy there of ABC Capital Markets, and I'm going to give you a little bit of a question, Ali, just to find a word on Woz, if you can. Let's take away here. Yeah, they also beat on a lot of metrics, including net interest income. So those higher rates helping Woz Fargo, but they missed on efficiency. We welcome you on that net and our financialiken.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2778,2022-10-14 10:57:14
14553," Yeah, they also beat on a lot of metrics, including that interest income. So those higher rates helping Wells Fargo, but they missed on efficiency. Will investors allow that to happen over and over as a question or is net interest income enough? Bram, where are the storm clouds? Well, Wells Fargo, third quarter provision for credit losses. They came in above expectations, 784 million versus the estimated 610.8 million. It's the credit losses. It's the investment losses. What happens if we get to a scenario that people think is the silver lining of the fed slowing down some of those rate hikes or perhaps even dropping them in the face of weakness? What does it do then to some of these banks that are getting higher incomes on the net interest margins, but are struggling with what is expected to be higher low losses and investment losses. Is there a hurricane brewing? I mean, the irony is that Jamie Diamond is saying that there is and everybody is cheering his results and saying you just made so much money. Okay, so you know, try to try to square that one. I think we're going to try and square that one for the next couple of hours. In the next couple of hours, we'll talk about US retail sales. We'll go to the UK. We're here from Liss Trust, the British Prime Minister and just a moment will catch up with Sebastian Richan for South Gent from New York. This is Blaineback. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because a lot of like when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When you know in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year, that would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. We had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get all night. Well, yeah. Bloomberg television. Top experts, great questions.

This is going to monitor policy appear to be moving in completely opposite directions. The Bank of England is having to try and manage the chaos that the government has been creating in the bond market. The bond market of vigilante is a back. What we had in UK is symptomatic of what is happening elsewhere. For the Fed, they're strapping themselves in for this. They're expecting some increase in volatility because the world is uncertain. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow, and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City for our audience worldwide. Good morning, good morning. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio right here in New York City alongside Lisa Bramowitz. I'm Jonathan Farrow. Genonialy Bass, standing by for earnings on Wall Street. We're getting to JP Morgan in just a moment. Grandma retail sales coming up a little bit later. And we've still got a process, the price action of yesterday, especially given the strength that we're seeing in certain components of the population amid the weakness that you're seeing in others just because of inflation. A messy messy. Messy, the word of the week. I mean, it's the word of the year. I was looking through some of the CPI components. You know what the biggest one was? Shelter. Nope. Shelter is the biggest one, but outside of shelter, it was childcare costs. And it those rose the most going back to 19-D2. We talk about specific corners of pain as people try to figure out how to live in an inflationary regime. The services versus goods. Yes. Once fading and the other one is getting really sticky. And it doesn't seem to be slowing down the sticky aspects of this inflation persistent, which raises a question, OK, well, how do we think in about what happens next year? And we heard from the banks that it's going to get really ugly, and they're doing just fine right now. And squaring that message is going to be increasingly difficult at a time when they're making incredible profits. And they are not passing along those interest costs to the savers. Can I do word of the week and word of the year and apply it to the UK? Please. What a mess. So you're going to hear from the Prime Minister a little bit later this afternoon, 2 p.m. local time. So 9 a.m. here in New York City. There are rumors reports the time suggesting the chance is about to get sacked. We've been reporting for the last 12 hours. We're going to get some form of U-turn. I'm trying to work out what kind of U-turn we're going to get. The Bank of England, Governor Bailey, was the villain a couple of days ago. He said you've got three days, and now he's some kind of hero. You still got this all to play out. You've still got a bank-giving and rate decision at the start of November. And you've got QT set to kick in at the end of this month. You're the expert in UK politics. I've not got that. But I am very much not. But as I hear all of this, can they do anything other than to announce today a full rollback of everything proposed and say we are going to spend more time to unleash something that is cohesive, well thought out, comprehensive, until then we're not going to make major changes. Can they do anything except for that without having to walk it back yet again a week later? The drama set to play out in the UK and we'll bring you some of that drama a little bit later. Right now, no drama in this equity market. It futures up 410s of 1% on a S&P 500. Tons of drama in the bond market in the last 24 hours. At the moment, yields in the UK aggressively lower down by 25 basis points. Yesterday in the US, aggressively higher, the two-year briefly through 350 on a two-year 450, rather right now on a 10-year, about 389, 12 on a 10-year, yield to lower by about five basis points. Bramow, JP Morgan behind us, more banks still to come. Yeah, and JP Morgan shares flying up now nearly 2.5% in pre-market trading after reporting, better than expected earnings on those interest margins that really compensate for a lot of the losses and other places they did also beat and fixed income. We also heard from Wells Fargo, those shares up more than 2% in pre-market trading. Morgan Stanley up in about a half an hour and then an about an hour's time city group. How do they parse out the fear of what's to come with what is going on right now, which is profits? And that is going to be a political discussion, as well as one, that perhaps can give some guidance as to where we are in this economic cycle. At 8.30 a.m., we get retail sales. Interesting this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2780,2022-10-14 11:05:54
14555," as to where we are in this economic cycle. At 8.30 a.m. we get retail sales. Interesting to see how that breaks down, considering some of the weakness that we've seen in certain areas, but the resilience in the CPI, people are still willing to spend. And then the University of Michigan, October, Sentiment Index at 10 a.m. I can feel John sighing, being like I hate looking at this thing. But I am curious if we start to see, I know you're absolutely out of the building at 9.59 a.m. But I am curious about whether we do get some sort of deterioration here, simply because gasoline prices are starting to rise again in addition to all of the gloom and doom that you hear from everyone. And I know I could be part of the problem there. Also, we get a slew of fed speak today. And John, I hear that you're actually interested in it today, which is I guess a new one, considering how much it takes. I'm sure that's the eye commentary. So we get Kansas City Fed President Esther George, Fed Governor Lisa Cook and Fed Governor Chris Waller. How do they spin this at a time when people are ratcheting up their expectations for what the Fed has to do with rate hikes, given that the terminal rate now priced into the market is 4.9% of March of next year. Getting closer to 5%. We've been told a hurricane was coming. It's not even raining on JPMorgan this morning. The stock is up by 2.4%. We're going to catch up with Schneider through the Abbott Schneider. I just wanted to cross over to just briefly. The take away from these numbers from JPMorgan. What's the number one talking point for you and the team right now? He just raised his net interest in expectations by $3.5 billion. Where is the regulatory concern there? Is what I want to know. Deposits have slowed to only 3%. And so is there a more wiggle room here to them lending at a greater rate in the face of a worse economic environment? And the buybacks are set to come back potentially set to resume early next year. We'll be back to Shanali later on. What's left this hour? How many more bank earnings have we got? Well, I mean, it depends if you include 8 AM, but we've got two. Two. Two more still to come. The goal next week. Yep. OK. Sebastian is your upper judge. It's Nash. Can't wait. Head of US rate strategy has sucked in. Sebastian, I want to start with the right story. And can we start with that two years today? Through 450, briefly. Really powerful move. Sebastian, if you rethought just where this Fed funds is going to peak next year? The market saying that it's going to peak at 5%. But it's really hard to know for sure. Right? Because it's an extraordinarily volatile. I'd say anywhere between 4 and a half to 5% makes sense, which is what they told us in the summary of economic projections. But it really depends on the trajectory for inflation going forward. If we do continue to see persistent inflation and also persistent underlying strength in the economy, especially the job market's extraordinary resilient, we're going to get retail sales today. I think we're going to, you know, the consumers also pretty resilient. So under the circumstances, the Fed's going to keep continuing to raise it aggressively until they see the need to slow down. I don't think that's this year. So, but for a lot of people earlier this year, we're getting bullish on longer term rates. There seems to be a bit of a rethink of that of late, not only because of where inflation has come in, but internationally, the contagion effects of the entire world unraveling zero rate policies for that have been in place for more than a decade. Has that been true for you as well? Are you changing how high you expect yields to be able to ultimately go on the long end because what we saw in the UK about the potential of selling from international investors? I think the US is in a very different spot than the UK, right? You have a situation in the UK where I'd call it a crisis of confidence. You're seeing this massive rise in long and yields and then all this, the issues with UK pensions and margin calls. The US is positioned very differently from that perspective. You know, broadly speaking, the tenure or the long end of the US curve tends to be very good demand from pension funds, you know, US as well as globally, you know, Japanese life, first in the life. And also, it tends to be a safe haven asset with the front-end paying to Fed expectations. You're going to see a decent amount of demand for the long end if we start seeing perhaps a meaningful slowdown in the US as well as global growth. So we have a very different dynamic in the US, relative to everywhere else in the world. And that's why we see a scenario where if global economy has continued to rise, I think treasures are going to actually continue to outperform relative to Bunsen and Gelfin.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2781,2022-10-14 11:10:12
14556," see a scenario where if global economy has continued to rise, I think treasuries are going to actually continue to outperform relative to Bunsen and Guels. And what you're going to see is a narrowing of that spread between say Bunsen and the treasuries as the sell-off continues. That said, I'm curious about the effects of certain exogenous events and what that means for investors in Japan, for example, in the UK, places that might sell what they can, not what they want to, and what they can sell is treasuries. How much are we going to get the ripple effects of that for a longer period of time creating disruption in the world's essentially most liquid market? That's a very good question, because yesterday we saw what we believe is some sort of an intervention coming from Japan, and the end depreciated with the after the CPN, when the dollar appreciated. And then we saw this sort of quick reverse. So we believe that that's some sort of intervention coming from Japan. But you also see that from other global central banks in India, South Korea, there's also evidence from other central banks trying to intervene in the FX markets. Yes, there's some selling of treasuries, but it's really very, very small. It's not going to have sort of a meaningful impact in the treasuring market to cost yields to rise meaningfully. I think if anything, all of the selling that you're seeing is leading to poor liquidity in the bond market. You're seeing more choppy price actions. You're seeing tailed options. The Fed's not actively buying treasuries here. So again, that's contributing to the poor liquidity conditions, if anything, in the bond market. I always think it's harsh when a CEO gets fired at the stock rallies. And I wonder how much of that dynamic will still play out in the UK today, as we're reporting over ITV, the ITV news joining the times of London, that quasi-quarting will be removed as chancellor. Subadre, is that move sufficient for you to say that the issues that we've had in the guild market will be over? Are you turned from the government today, a new chancellor? Is that enough? I don't think so. I think that it's very easy to sort of destroy credibility. I think it's a lot harder to build credibility back. So the trust administration is going to have to work towards building credibility back. This might be the first step of many that they're going to have to take. But it's not an easy task from Yaron. And whoever else replaces it, you know, quasi-quarting is going to have just a hard of a job going forward. And this doesn't make it easy for the Bank of England either. So you really need to see all of these three, you know, the government as well as the Bank of England work closely to sort of restore confidence, if you will, in the guild market. Subadre, wonderful to get your thoughts on all of this. As always, thank you. Subadre is happy there of Sokchen. Subadre's thoughts on the guild market, much, much harder to rebuild credibility very easy to lose it. Well, and you're seeing that right now. I mean, right now, the pound is declining versus the dollar, even on this news. So it's not exactly reprieve for a political regime that has seen incredible tumult. There is a question of what it will take for them to restore credibility and whether there will be, as you mentioned earlier, a premium, the risk premium built into the pound for a longer period of time hours is results of this. There's some scars left on sterling assets. After the last month, we'll find out how deep they are. We'll catch up with Guy Johnson over in London in just a moment, a little bit later in the next hour, Jim Pulse and a chief investment strategist at Luthorl Group looking forward to that conversation. We are up on the week. I check this morning, just about up on the week. It's been crazy. I think if you ask people to guess, they'd have no idea. I think it rightly so. All over the place. From New York, this is Bloomberg. Keeping you up to date with News More Round the World with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Bloomberg has learned Liz Trust plans to hold a press conference today, announcing plans to reverse parts of her economic strategy. The U.T. her and followed weeks of market pressure to explain how she'll pay for her program. Attention is focused in recent days on whether trust will cancel plans to freeze corporation tax next year instead of raising it as previously planned, the pound erased losses against the euro. Meanwhile, the Times is reporting UK Chancellor Quasic Quarteng is, quote, being sacked in preparation for trust's economic policy reversal. It is not yet clear who will replace Quarteng. Downing Street is not.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2782,2022-10-14 11:14:23
14557," Mr. Kwaisee Korteng is, quote, being sacked in preparation for Tress' economic policy reversal. It is not yet clear who will replace Korteng. Downing street is not commenting at this time. Germany's defense minister says NATO allies must take Russian threats to use nuclear weapons in its war on Ukraine seriously, but should not let them disrupt international efforts to support the government in Kiev. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that any nation that interferonism in the invasion of Ukraine would suffer, quote, consequences that you've never experienced in your history. It's comments widely seen as threatening a nuclear strike. Chinese sensors have taken the extreme step of restricting the search term Beijing on social media. The move comes after a rare public announcement of President Xi Jinping. Photos and videos of two banners criticizing Xi and his strict COVID-19 policy are circulating on social media. The protest comes days before Xi outlines his vision for China at the Communist Party Congress, at which he's expected to secure a President defying third term.

Apple has identified its next big business, bringing advertisements to more parts of your iPhone. Today, Apple pushes ads in three places, the App Store, Apple News and the Stocks app. In the news and stocks apps, Apple shows display advertisements. That means that third party companies like car dealerships or mortgage lenders can showcase their advertisements just like they can on a website. On the App Store, the situation is different. There Apple has search ads. This allows developers to buy their way to showing a buyer on search results. For instance, an App Store developer can bid for the term car racing or basketball so their apps would surface above competing apps in the list of results. Apple's push into ads is a little ironic, given that its ATT or app tracking transparency privacy feature limits the ability for meta, snap and even smaller developers to generate as much revenue as possible for matter-at-tizing. That's because the feature allows users to choose if they want their data collected and tracked across third party apps and websites. Still, Apple's hoping to expand its own ads business and is planning to add search ads to its Maps app. Other areas where ads could eventually appear are in Apple Books and Apple podcasts, along maybe one day with an ad supported tier of Apple TV Plus to compete with new offerings from Netflix and other streaming video providers.

14558," When US inflation numbers are released, the score is inflation one fed nothing today. Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed. Core CPI in America 40 year high yields are absolutely fine. Micro-dead down and down high. It's ugly. And instant expert analysis. What is the makeup is in place? She are watching the underlying fundamental. Will they go 100 basis points? The down shift just keeps getting pushed out. Now it looks like we're going into extra n8. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation. Strong enough to stay. We will never. All eyes on the UK over the last couple of weeks. That conversation will continue a little bit later. We're looking for a news conference potentially from the Prime Minister, Liz Traster 2PM local time. That's 9 AM in New York City. Lisa potentially a news conference could be a statement. We don't know because we had no confirmation at all. All we've got is reports that the chancellor could be on its way out. Could be getting sacked according to the ITV news station over in the UK. And of course to the Times newspaper. What happens next? I've got no idea. Yeah, the Treasury Department over in the UK is not responding to a request for any kind of response to this. There is, however, a response in markets. There is an expectation that they have to do something and something dramatic. Just what it has to be in order to restore confidence is really unclear. And pan-curny's pouring out through this morning. We heard from JP Morgan a little bit earlier. Shannani, I'd love to get your thoughts on this. The stock's up by 2.5%. We've done a lot of the good news. Let's talk about the credit provisions. The provisions for credit losses. How much bigger than expected were they? Listen, at 1.5 billion, they expected 1.2 billion dollars across the bank. And remember, the reason this is not too big of a deal to the market is because they're also growing loans and net interest income. Net interest income of, for the year, of more than 3.5 billion dollars higher excluding markets is significant. So a couple hundred million more, really, of provisions will come as loans grow. How important is it in some of the earnings calls as they, I'm sure you'll be listening in on them later this morning where they give some sense of how much more there is in terms of some of these investment losses, especially with the likes of the Twitter deal outstanding. And many other deals where they've promised to provide financing. What's interesting is, David A. She's Chaliceio of Bloomberg News has reported that it's going to be about $500 million with the losses. But the thing is, it spreads really blow out a little more. I could get a lot more. I've heard estimates as high as $1.5 billion across the street. And again, Morgan Stanley was lead left on that one. I think there's a lot of questions here about the cost of doing business. If you're going to win a deal, are you going to be earning fees that are above those losses as you consider future deals? That's going to be the key question as we head into a choppy market. David, I would have been proud of that. I should be. Jeffrey Morgan up in the pre-market by a little more than 2%. Gilt, Iranian, Gilt, Aloa, Guy Johnson and London joined us now for more. Guy, you tell me what's the next couple of hours look like over at number 10? Some sort of statement or potentially questions being taken. I wouldn't want to be answering questions if I was Theresa May. So we'll see whether or not it is just a statement. What is contained within that statement is you suggested, John. Couple of sources now speculating that quasi-quart saying the chancellor could go. Who will replace him? I suspect that Liz Truss is looking at a cast of characters. She is going to be looking for somebody stable. She's going to be looking for somebody as somebody pointed it out to me earlier on today that is going to engage brain before mouth, that is going to be basically giving a sense of stability to this government from an economic point of view. But what this government tries to achieve, John, and it's going to be really interesting to hear what Liz Truss talks about here is what is the objective now? This was meant to be a tax-cutting supply side reform government. That's gone. Now what? I love it, John. Engage brain before mouth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2784,2022-10-14 11:23:02
14559," This was meant to be a tax cutting supply side reform government. That's gone. Now what? I love this, John. Incage brain before mouth, I think I need to. We're pretty blunt in the UK. I like that. A straightforward. Well, and I like that. And Guy, there is an issue as they try to form what comes next of how much they have to do. Do they just scrap the entire thing and have a carte blanche to be get again? Or do they have to really come out with something that seems cohesive, even though it's clear that perhaps this came rather quickly? There will be nothing cohesive. There will be nothing well thought out. There will be. There is no plan, Lisa. Plan A is gone. Plan B. I don't know what plan B looks like, but plan B is basically just going to be muddled through. All of the kind of plans that they put in place. So there's going to be. There is no kind of dash for growth anymore. That's gone. So what replaces this? Are we not looking for growth anymore? No tax cuts, no supply side reform, no planning reform, no immigration. All of these things are off the table now. And you wonder whether the UK economy is just going to limp through for another couple of years. Can the UK economy afford that? Well, but Guy, can you talk a little bit about the visuals of quasi-quarting being at the IMF. And having this discussion, the IMF has been vocal about what they think about this fiscal plan. And the IMF and central bankers around the world really coalesced around Andrew Bailey and seemed to support him and not the quasi-quarting budget or the Liz Trust budget. How much does that play into what's transpiring now? I think it's hugely important. It's not just those officials that are there as well. Lots of private sector people are there. They're all going to be piling the pressure on as well. This was a potentially inflationary budget at a time when inflation seems to be something of a problem. We're going out of the bank of England, which I think is kind of, we need to talk a bit more about this as well. Maybe credibility is enhanced for Andrew Bailey. But on the other hand, he's still left with a series of, I would say, substantial problems. I don't know whether or not we're going to see stability on Monday morning in the guilt market. There are some suggestions. Is it logical at this point to proceed with QT when you're just so recently being supporting the long end of the guilt market? Is that logical? Do we need a statement from the governor as well, come Monday morning, that they are going to postpone? I don't know how long QT, particularly at the long end. And is that compatible with still raising rates to fight inflation? It's a mess. Well, Guy, you mentioned it, particularly at the long end. I wonder if the opportunity is available for the governor to really clarify what part of the curve QT would be more operational, something that Steve Major suggested in the FT earlier this week. I'm going to talk about that guy, discuss that at all. Not that I'm aware of. Maybe the discussion is happening behind closed doors. The Bank of England is a, unlike number 10 downing street, is a fairly tightly sealed operation. So I don't know is the answer to the question. But it does seem, there are, it does seem a little illogical to have done what you've just done. And in some ways to be supporting the pension industry, foreign ongoing repo operations, then be effectively selling long-daisy guilt back into the market. Maybe you do effectively twist it the other way and you end up, you could sell frontend. And there's also going to be more demand for frontend as well at this point. So that made to Stephen's point. So maybe that works more logically. But I don't think the Bank of England is kind of out of the woods here by any stretch of the imagination. Guy, we've got about 30 seconds. I have to forget who the prime minister is. We've had so many over the last few years. So I get a new chancellor. So let's talk about it just briefly. What are the names? We go back to Chancellor Javid. What are we going back to? I would, so if I was looking at a list, I would look at former chief secretary to the treasuries. So to the treasurer, I would think about some of the name Barclay, for instance, those kinds of names. If you think about Mr Hammond as Chancellor, you need that kind of grey figure right now. That may be being very unfair to, to fill it. But you need that kind of that kind of accountants approach to this. And accountants are going to hate me for this as well. But you need that kind of, as I said earlier, engage brain before mouth kind of... Just keep defending everyone, Guy. Yeah, well, I'm doing a pretty good job so far. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2785,2022-10-14 11:27:28
14560," But you need that kind of, as I said earlier, engaged brain before mouth, kind of... Just keep defending everyone, Guy. Yeah, well, I'm doing a pretty good job so far. Guy Johnson, thank you, sir, Adelaunton. I know where guys going with that. You need someone who's been around in Westminster for a long time with some credibility because they need some credibility fast. And they need somebody who knows how to communicate with some consistency and doesn't do. I don't think we can call it a U-turn. I mean, you call it a U-turn when you've turned and then turned. Well, I said you know, standing still. I don't think it's standing still. I don't think the barcode is standing still. It's switchbacks. We've been in San Francisco to switchbacks. Unchanged. Isn't that what Chancellor Quattanks said? We haven't changed our position. I said, believe it, do a U-turn twice. You haven't changed your position. Yeah, but you've used up some gas and possibly wrecked some parts of the car. From New York, this is Blaineback. music music vol. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fitter faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sawnas, and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating. The way training's going, completely changing the way recovery's going. I think the sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind. Every time you're chasing the latest, greatest, newest tool, you're probably chasing a mirage. So you've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg? I've seen a Bloomberg. I've been and I've seen it. Lots of Bloomberg. I've seen it. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg?

14561," Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. It's a great question. Great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get online. I'd like to ask that. Bloomberg Television. Top X-Quarates. Great questions. Live from New York City this morning. Good morning to you. The price action shaping up as follows on the S&P 500 on the NASDAQ. After a vicious, reverse, yes, today, I'll get my words out, vicious, reverse, all yesterday, in the equity market futures up a third of 1%. Distracted by some news out of the BBC just a moment ago that Quartang is out as the chancellor. Quartang is no longer the chancellor. The BBC understands it comes in its speculation that this trust will today announce a new turn on parts of the mini budget. So that's ITV, as the BBC, as the Times of London, all saying they're sort of the same thing that this chancellor is out. So is this how they want to message it? Is this how they wish that they could get some sort of communication to markets, to the population? We raise this guy back from the IMF. To tell me, SAC. To tell me, SAC. And we want someone who has a brain before. Guys, if we need an account and someone reminded me on Twitter that Liz Truss isn't a council. That's not probably very helpful, so. So I'm not sure if we need that kind of account. And I want to run through the bond market price action two, four, your two, ten, and thirties in America. And then we're going to get to the more outstanding numbers, which have just dropped your two year. 44240 on a two year. You're just coming about four basis points. JP Morgan, a little bit earlier, Shunani Bassett Morgan standing out right now. We are seeing fixed income trading here, miss expectations. We are seeing equities come in also a little below expectations, but more than what you saw over at JP Morgan. So you're seeing them keep their lead in that business. Listen, top line, you don't see this much from Morgan Stanley, but they did miss slightly on the top line, on total revenue for the bank. Of course, weakness in the trading business does not help, John. The question here is how they're going to be marking these losses here. I'm trying to parse right through the statement to try to give you a better sense here of what you can expect from those provisioning issues that you're seeing when it comes to that investment banking business. Investment banking revenue down 55% from a year ago. So just to give you a sense right now, Morgan Stanley shares lower by a tens of a percent in the immediate knee jerk reaction to some of these earnings. But this highlights the gap between JP Morgan and city group and Bank of America. And then on the other hand, the Morgan Stanley's the Goldman Sachs is that derive a much bigger proportion of their revenue from the mainstay of investment banking of deal action of what's going on with markets. What does this say about perhaps the larger story from that perspective versus the idiosyncratic specific execution stories? James Gorman, the CEO of Morgan Stanley likes to think about this as a ballast. When one business is not doing well, the other one will. All of Wall Street had that investment banking ballast for the last couple of years. And that ballast is eroding. It's fading. And so what happens then? So for Morgan Stanley's case, you have net revenue of wealth management. That's their ballast $6.1 billion. That's in line with expectations. It's rising compared to prior years. It shows you the wealthier clients are holding up a little better in this kind of an environment. But again, there are some serious issues. When you think about the future here in the next couple of years of what investment banking looks like we've talked about at the cost of doing business here when fees are simply eroding. Mr. Gorman, continuing to repurchase $2.6 billion worth of shares. What do we learn at a back capital return programs this morning? Yeah, Morgan Stanley has been the most attractive this year in terms of their announcements. And again, they've had a lot more flexibility. They're also the richest of the big six banks when it comes to the price to book ratio. So they have a little bit more room on valuation here to fall. If there's any bad news, then for example, the JP Morgan, which was actually trading more cheaply, Goldman will be the million dollar question here because Goldman has been flirting with book value or below for the last couple of months, let's say. So is there room here for Goldman to beat whether it's on trading or other businesses here? Is there something that people will see in the business models that will last them through the cycle a little better or a little worse? The CEO, Lisa Sank, the company continuing to distribute a healthy dividend. The capital return programs at Morgan Stanley ongoing, JP Morgan hopes is going to resume early next year with buybacks. It doesn't sound like a major hurricane is coming. And I'm not being snarky about it. I'm just saying, look at what the banks are doing with capital returns. Still giving money back to investors. It's not like we're falling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2787,2022-10-14 11:36:15
14562," It doesn't sound like a major hurricane is coming and I'm not being snarky about it I'm just saying look at what the banks are doing with capitol returns still giving money back to investors It's not like we're falling off a cliff anytime soon based on the way they're behaving I'm gonna go out in a limb here and suspect that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs CEOs are not going to have the same tone The Jamie Diamond does because they have different incentives They want to give some confidence that there can be deals that get done whereas JP Morgan I'm just gonna be a little cynical here might be more interested in having some of the regulatory oversight Removed and the regulatory provisions that are crimping some of their balance sheet Expectations as well as their buyback program which was crimped by some of the stress tests So how much is that part of the storm are you suggesting this is a lobbying effort? I'm just saying it doesn't make sense based on the on the ground Action and I do wonder what the motivation is to talk like that if there isn't the evidence that they can point you right now Shana Ali yeah, can I just you know, it's interesting You think that the main street problems don't fall over into in thousand banking But they do and you're seeing actually they beat on fixing come trading and they are more resilient than the next bank We're gonna see report in just 20 minutes. It is city group. Are they going to be hurt here a little bit by the currency fluctuations? We're seeing the value at risk rise for JP Morgan to take on some heat in these trading businesses, but the mortgage markdowns It's it's an issue you saw it in Jeffries. Are we gonna see it in city group as anyone gonna talk about it? We're gonna talk about it. Yeah, I'm gonna force them to can Leon joins us now He's gonna talk about it in just a moment can Leon the equity research director at CFRA Can it's a tradition to catch up with you on earnings morning on Wall Street? Let's start with JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley your thoughts, please They're very different banks and and in direction and rest They're very different stories so JP Morgan So much regulation capital butter buffers they can't buy back stock And they can't really tell you what recession will mean for the bank We are seeing cracks and non net interest income But if you're a bank analyst you like really the wave of higher rates and that really benefited JP Morgan results more than anything for the third quarter Morgan Stanley we got a different narrative and Directionally they they don't have a consumer bank But they're a the largest wealth management firm and they're directly James Gorman is looking to them with peers like Black Rock and Charles Schwab these have higher multiple stocks and you do have recurring revenue in the stable parts of Morgan Stanley Which is wealth Investment banking obviously is the more cyclical area and you never get rewarded in the stock price With you have a great quarter. So I think Morgan Stanley has the right course It just went over three in terms of equity and debt underwriting and M&A. They were all down significantly That was no surprise Ken is wealth management really the ballast that it used to be based on some of the returns that we've seen with one Shop saying that the 60 40 portfolio has seen a 25% peak to trough loss over the past year Absolutely, and it's much more dynamic than a static conversation that it's just a bunch of advisors Morgan Stanley has a Lord largest share in Advice given but they also with the e-trade acquisition are number two behind fidelity in terms of the 401k or the workplace And they all have the digital platforms to get the early millennial investors This is a dynamic area for growth for wealth and James Gorman was way ahead of the industry I want to get across the Gina Martin Adams on son of this she joins us now from Bloomberg intelligence Gina The earnings are starting to pour in and I have to say that so far that haven't been that bad I think it have Delta thinking of Domino's others as well. Take your thoughts on the banks this morning, please Yeah, I mean, I think that it very close the financial sector at larger expected to be the worst of the worst in the S&P 500 Down for a second consecutive quarter Expectations were down for a double digit pace of decline for much of this sector for this quarter That's pretty low expectations in a very low in the very easy bar to beat for the most part So I think that you can extend that argument to much of the S&P 500 frankly. We've gone from a point of expecting ten",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2788,2022-10-14 11:40:15
14563," Expectations in a very low, in the very easy bar to beat for the most part. So I think that you can extend that argument to much of the S&P 500, frankly. We've gone from a point of expecting 10% earnings growth back in July to now expecting just over 1% earnings growth on the index for the third quarter. And very clearly, we haven't seen quite that degree of a slowdown. So what we've priced in is significantly greater than probably is going to emerge over the next several weeks. So, Gina, do you think that that's going to be a rallying call? Or do you think that people are going to say, wait a second, we're seeing all of these cracks in real time that haven't filtered through to the bottom line of all these companies yet? And hang tight because the pain is coming. Yeah. It depends on what the companies say about the outlook, frankly, Lisa. This is such a difficult time to forecast earnings. I mean, really, in the grand scheme of things, what you have are tough comps off of easy comps, off of tough comps, right? This all goes back to what happened in 2020, which was an absolute earnings crash. Then you had earnings completely surge in 2021. And now we're coming off of that surge in 2022. So distinguishing how much of this is just comps versus how much of this is a true slowdown and economic activity on trend is really, really challenging. That said, the reason that I think that we want to realize so much on company diets is because they're the only ones that can really tell us what's likely to happen into 2023. How much of this is just a comparison to extraordinary results a year ago versus a true slowdown and economic activity that they expect to extend is a huge question mark. I think that extends across industries, frankly, financials is not my area to watch this season because I think that expectations were incredibly low. The area that is much riskier, frankly, going forward is likely to be the tech, the mega cap stocks, some of the consumer discretionary stocks where expectations are still a little bit high and expectations for growth into 2023 are probably too high. And Ken, just heading back to you, given that we're going to be hearing from the banks and possibly some of their expectations, perhaps they're not necessarily the main bellweathers this season. What are you looking for in terms of exactly what Shnallian John were talking about, the mortgage losses, what they're talking about with credit provisions and the expectation for a rockier road? It's going to happen. There's no question about it. And I think the resilience of the banks is their ability to have the capital buffers and also higher rates will offset some of those concerns. But we haven't, you know, all morning, we haven't talked about exogenous factors, something where it's the punch unexpected, whether it's coming from anywhere in the credit markets or anything related to risk. Got to leave it there, Ken. Thanks for being with us, Ken Leon. Just going to join us a little bit later for city earnings. Another news organisation in the UK reporting the chance. Who is it? This one's Sky News, quasi-quarting sectors, chancellor after the mini budget turmoil. So I make that sky, the BBC about 10 minutes ago. We broke that on this program when that came out. Then it was ITV and then it was the time to London before it. This is kind of a circus. This can't be how they want the communication to go about. Fantastic insight. Thank you, I try. I think that's exactly what this is. It's messy. And it's a circus. On board, it's a messy circus. It's a messy circus. And they need to clean it up. Yeah. Stephen Stanley's going to join us shortly.

US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a video shot during the January 6th insurrection that she wanted to punch President Donald Trump if he showed up at the Capitol. Now, video released by CNN shows Pelosi in her office as a Capitol is about to come under assault. In the footage, Pelosi said, quote, I hope he comes. I'm going to punch him and I'm going to jail and I'm going to be happy. Well, lawmakers want to question Trump about the 2021 riot and are demanding documents and testimony about his role. The move comes just weeks ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.

14564," Hitting his attempt to take the social media company private. According to a letter on sealed in court, attorneys for Twitter sought documents last week related to the musk investigation. Now by that point, Musk reversed himself on walking away from the $44 billion takeover, but he and Twitter were still adversaries in court. A new Turkish law mandates jail time for what authorities describe as spreading false information on digital platforms. The measure was proposed by the governing AK party and its nationalist ally MHP. People there now face jail terms of up to three years if found guilty. Media groups and opposition parties have described the bill as censorship and a move to stiple critics ahead of next year's election.

We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on the pays and how much the consumer is paying them. And to the kind of value and transparency they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? What are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in the car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

You have to build emotional endurance because there's no straight line of success at the kind of all over place and you have to just be able to work through those things. And then I think one of the things that I do every week is I try to create serendipity. I don't mind the Fed getting back to normal, I think they ought to, but they said they wanted to not add to uncertainty. They're adding to uncertainty. So what they should do is say, look, this is what we're doing and we're trying to get back to normal, but then we're going to stop because we don't want to kill the economy for inflation, but I look we're going to win anyway. Great to catch up with David Kelly yesterday, the Chief Global Strategy, just a JP Morgan asset management live from New York City this morning. Good morning. Let's start with a price action in about 43 minutes from now. You'll get US retail sales in America. I believe you get city earnings in about 10 minutes too, but we need to focus on the UK as well. Sterling breaking through 112, 1199. We're down a little more than 1% on that currency pair at the moment. So Sterling is a whole lot weaker. Can't find a rally right now in the last couple of hours. Guilts can yield to lower by about 20 basis points on a UK 10 year to 390, eight. Let's call it 399 as the reports continue to pour in Lisa that he's out. The chance that it's going to get the sack. We've heard that from Sky from BBC from ITV from the Times newspaper. And we're still waiting to hear from the Prime Minister, Liz Trust. This doesn't necessarily engender a whole deal of confidence. So it'll be interesting to see how choppy the trading really is because unless they can come out with some sort of conclusion or clarity in terms of what they plan to do. And Guy Johnson was saying that is not going to happen. Then how do you then give some sense of a direction to a market that is desperately looking for one? You turn. How much credibility will you reclaim from the you turn? My question would be, OK, let's say they go back. They remove the whole thing. Let's go back to the day before it was announced. Does bank having been pricing return to that day? Or is it still elevated? And that's a real question. And I think it's going to be tough to unwind a lot of the work, the damage that's been done in this market over the last month. I would agree. I also think that it brings back into focus where we are in terms of it is not just a UK problem. In the meantime, we got a CPI report in the US that was hotter than expected. You had dollar strength. You had this feeling that the Fed would hike more than expected. It has a ripple effect. The world moves, even if they're doing a you turn and standing in the same place. Steven Stanley joins us now. Chief economist at Amherst Piffont. Steven, you may expect that the you turn a pause to pivot from this Fed any time soon after that day to yesterday. Good morning, Jonathan. I'm sure they would love to, but no. No, it's not in the cards. I mean, clearly inflation is becoming more entrenched. The breadth of underlying inflation right now is just very troubling. And I think it's going to be a while until the Fed gets inflation in control, unfortunately. Steven, is the data that we got yesterday mean you rethink the terminal rate that the Fed would ultimately get to in the cycle? So my estimate was already above 5%. I think I'm sticking with that for the moment. But I think there's certainly some upside risk to that. I definitely think we'll see another 75 basis point move in November. And I had thought they would slow down to 50 in December. And I'm going to cling to that for the moment. But certainly if the inflation numbers over the next couple of months come in the way that the last two have, then it's not clear to me that they can step down from these 75 basis point hikes. Steven, what do you make of all the discussion that perhaps we are overlooking the lag effect in the rent component? The fact that housing does tend to operate on a lag and that there may be a decline in the next six months that hasn't yet fed into the data. And so we're going to get it, even if the Fed doesn't raise rates as aggressively. What do you say to people who really are arguing that perhaps the Fed is overreacting? Yeah. Well, the research suggests that the lag is from home prices to the shelter cost components of the inflation numbers is about 12 to 18 months. So I think our realistic scenario here is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2791,2022-10-14 11:53:31
14566," The lag is from home prices to the shelter cost components of the inflation numbers is about 12 to 18 months. So I think our realistic scenario here is that maybe rent and owners equivalent rent continue to accelerate until around the middle of next year. And that's a long time for the fed to sit. You know, to kind of say, trust us, we got this under control. I think the other point would be that if it were only about shelter costs, then that argument would be very powerful. But the reality is that we're saying inflation very hot. And in many cases, accelerating across just a, you know, virtually the entire list of categories within the CPI or the PC deflator. So this isn't, you know, shelter is one story, but it's not the only one. And unfortunately, the data are pointing to a more systemic issue. You know, wage pressures are pushing into prices now. And I think, you know, the risk is that the Fed has talked about is that the longer inflation is high, the more people get used to it, the more they start to incorporate it into their plans. And that's why the Fed's in a hurry because they're trying to cut that off before it gets kind of set in stone. How many times have we sat here, Leastron, said they got more work today? They've got more work today. How much are we getting? Are we catching up to the build-ed-ly version of the world that he will lead out yesterday? We are there in terms of the market expectation. And then you have some people, including Jason Furman, out in Twitter saying that perhaps it's even higher than what the market is currently expecting because of the sticky components that are rising at a really rapid rate. Steven Stanley, a Vamhurst peer-porn, Steven always wanted for the catch-out with you, sir. The rumors in the UK are all over the place. So won't harm to add another one. This comes from Nicholas Watts. The latest reporting from the BBC News Night, News Night, Political Editor. A group of senior tories have been holding discussions and have decided the following. The second of Quasi Quartan will prompt them to come out publicly next week and call on ListTrust to resign. My source quote, these are serious people. The PM will find it difficult to survive. Listen to the visual this reporter in the UK goes on to say, my source tells me ListTrust has made a mistake if she thinks her outgoing friend Quasi Quartan has no base in the parliamentary party. People like Quasi, his friend be his honest, maybe a bit too honest, maybe that's his problem. So this could be the direction to travel. The drama I think a lot of people assume does not end today. And right now I'm looking at a pound hitting new session lows at 111.74. This isn't exactly versus the dollar. This isn't exactly creating some confidence in leadership at a time when that's kind of needed. You've got to work at what comes next and I've got no idea. So we're going to do it all. The only thing I know based on reporting right now is that we're set to hear from the prime minister a little bit later this morning. Niam, New York time, which will be 2 p.m. local time. We have understood over the last day or so based on reporting is they're set to walk back some of this stuff. How much of the U term we actually get in this announcement? Once again, I'm not sure. So we're talking about the politics of all of this and we thought we would be talking about the fact that the bond buying was ending today. So we're not going to have that ballast from the Bank of England come Monday at a time of incredible turmoil. I'll be it in a different manner than perhaps people had expected. Crazy time in the UK right now 111.70 on Wall Street. We had numbers from JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley. City's going to come up in about five minutes time. She's not even about an hour. So come on. Let's go. City next. Can you predict city based on what we've heard from JP and Morgan Stanley? City's got a tougher job here because there's so much more global than the other banks here. So we're going to want to look down and see how much that's actually impacting them. I also want to see how they're responding. It's amazing. If you look at Morgan Stanley, they had their compensation costs in line, but their head count is up. JP Morgan head count is up almost every major business line. So again, Jamie Diamond is talking about significant headwinds, but they're still investing. Maybe the bankers are not making as much as they were a year ago, but they are still getting jobs. Morgan Stanley lays a down 2.76% in early trading. I love that. You've had half an hour, Shnally. Read it. Tell us the future. Please. Isn't this the crystal ball on the table? This is the crystal ball. I can put our hands on it. My takeaway is equities underperformed, thick, thick trading outperformed. And this is interesting to me at a time when we're seeing spreads blow out, where you're starting to see illiquidity in markets suddenly banks are acting in the traditional function of trying to make markets. Do you know what that reminds me of? Remember this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2792,2022-10-14 11:57:49
14567," It's interesting to me at a time when we're seeing spreads blow out where you're starting to see illiquidity in markets suddenly banks are acting in the traditional function of trying to make markets It reminds me of remember the former president in Saudi in Saudi Arabia and they put their hands around that orb Was it an orb or something? It reminds me of a side strike. I still don't know what that was. What was that? What's this? I don't know We love it though. 845 Eastern of the next hour. Giddy Gopunath, the first deputy managing director of the IMF sitting down with Tom Kean coming up Should we anticipate that you will have regulations clarifying what the SEC is going to do on crypto currencies and related kinds of things in the near future? It's pretty clear that many of these tokens may be securities. What we've asked the trading platforms, the lending platforms, the other various venues to come in to work with us to get registered under the securities laws because of a platform has 50 or some of them 500 tokens on their platform. Probabilities are they're not all non securities. Now there's another issue that's arisen which is called gamification which is to say people are making a game out of trying to buy stocks. Are you worried about this phenomenon? We live in the 2020s in a new digital age where applications on our phones can use massive amount of data and then predict our behavior. What do we do when the digital algorithms are maximizing for the companies revenues rather than our returns? And so we're trying to think that through. It's not just gamification. It's a little bit more than that. It's whether there's a conflict between the app and our investment returns. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Chey Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is the Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift from businesses most influential and instrumental. It's mocking it at the bull's eye. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with.

One of the most important things is looking around the corner. Adrian Mitchell from Macy's. We have to let go of the traditional legacy department store and Lucas Eremella at Mondelese. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal. They are not. Look for chief future officer on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2793,2022-10-14 12:02:22
14568," and Lucas de Romela at Mondelays. We tend to believe that all consumers are equal, they are not. Look for Chief Future Officer on Bloomberg. The market is focused on one theme, inflation and rising rates and nothing else. I think we're just too obsessed with inflation because we haven't seen this beast in 40 years. The growth has to come down a lot if the Fed is going to contain these inflationary pressures. You really can't deny that this is a recipe for a recession. What gets us back to 2% is that firm foot on the brake pedal from the Federal Reserve. This is Bloomberg surveillance with Tom Keane, Jonathan Farrow and Lisa Abramowitz. Live from New York City this morning, good morning, good morning, what a morning for news. This is Bloomberg surveillance on TV and radio alongside Lisa Abramowitz, I'm Jonathan Farrow. Here in New York City alongside Channeling Basque, breaking down the Wall Street earnings, Tom Keane down in DC. He'll be catching up with the IMF's Geeta Gopinath a little bit later. This news just drops according to a person familiar with the matter. Quasicua Tang leaves the UK government. Our reporting here at Bloomberg, the Chancellor Lisa, is out. And now the question is, who's next? And we're getting some reporting on who potentially could be this 6666. Next, the successor, I will get my words out. It is that kind of morning at a time when how do you rebuild the trust in an administration that is really imperiled at this moment? I mean, some reporting, I believe, from the times that maybe Jeremy Hunt, the former Foreign Secretary of the UK a number of years ago, may become the new Chancellor. I believe he was also a backer of Rishi Sunak as well. Is that the direction this government might be going in? That's a reporting right now. If that's the case, what does that mean for Liz Truss and her survival at the helm of the party? Or is this basically a predecessor to kicking her out and electing someone new? Is this sort of the beginning of more political turmoil next week? So the Chancellor's out. We understand based on reporting through the whole of this morning that we're going to hear from the Prime Minister potentially in the 9 o'clock hour here in New York City. So that is 2pm local time over in the United Kingdom. And we understand based on reporting of the last 24 hours, Lisa, that there's going to be some form of U-turn on the announcements of a number of Friday's ago. How much for U-turn there will be, I don't know. If they don't have details as the U-turn simply cleaning house, and that seems to be the suggestion by some of the reporting coming out right now. That's the latest from the UK. You need to get the latest on Wall Street as well. News from City. Not either, the latest bank reporting this morning. The news is that fixed income trading has fallen below expectations. You have Jane Fraser in the statement addressing the fixed income business. High up in the release saying that it is in line with where they were about a year ago. But remember, this is an extraordinarily competitive business on Wall Street right now. So the miss is not a great sign out of business that she is holding on strong to trying to build, trying to be competitive with. Equities beat expectations. Investment banking fees have fallen below expectations. The revenue has fallen in line with expectations. One thing Jane Fraser did as soon as she got into City was reconsider where this bank needs to be. What the geographical global footprint is going to be. City is winding down all institutional banking services in Russia. We knew we were going in this direction. Shania, do you think we've reset now enough at City that the decisions have been made where City wants to be and where it doesn't want to be? That's a yes. Yes, they have gotten out of a lot of businesses and she has really shrunk this bank in a very significant way in the face of a lot of geopolitical headwinds in a year. So let's take that into consideration. They sell regulatory headwinds, which is why I don't want to say City Group is out of the woods. There's a reason they're trading so far below their book value and those regulatory headwinds are a big part of that regardless of what's happening across the globe. What about loan loss provisions at a time when that was very much in focus at JP Morgan? We heard some about that from Wells Fargo. Morgan Stanley was surprisingly light. Where is City on that? Yes, City is in line with expectations. There's two questions. We started to address it a little earlier. Provision are going higher because people are reserving more because they're lending more. Is City Group's provisions now in line with expectations because their lending appetite is less than JP Morgan's perhaps? What is their appetite to take on risk in this environment? I think it's a critical question. We're going to have to hear both the CFO answer when he speaks to journalists a little later this morning as well as to analysts after this. And I do have a sense of how they're pricing risk at a time of real choppy liquidity at a time when private markets largely are believed to not yet have been marked down in any significant way leading some of the illiquid assets on their books with some questionable valuations. So the important thing here Lisa is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2794,2022-10-14 12:06:30
14569," have been marked down in any significant way, leading some of the illiquid assets on their books with some questionable valuations. The important thing here, Lisa, is that you can take losses if you're also making much more money. And so to the extent that they're taking those losses in order to generate more fees and they're not taking them disproportionate across the business, value at risk, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan have been ticking higher, not in every single business, but certainly fixed income, JP Morgan had showed us the biggest share of that risk being taken on. Now, wouldn't you love to see citadel securities numbers right now? But the market makers are making in this environment because the banks have other problems on their hands, I think is still a critical question. So if we had the right kind of volatility, because they often complain, don't they? If the earnings are bad, it's the wrong kind of volatility. Was this the right kind of volatility? Super important. This is only till the third quarter. The size. So much worse since then, the tone I heard from bankers at the top of the house end of summer was pretty sanguine. Now it is a little frenetic exhausted. They're working late at the top of the house everywhere. We're down by 2% in early training for city in the pre-market. Ken Leon, join us again from CFRA. Ken, what's with the move down? What stands out for you? So I think for city, you know, it's a multi year turnaround story. They're still selling consumer banks outside the US. It's the most non-US bank of the big six. And going into next year, it's still a transition period. So I think cities trading at really low valuations to the pure group for those reasons. And they do have regulatory risk that Wells Fargo had, but it's improving. So cities still have to spend millions to upgrade its regulatory systems. Ken, how do you strip out execution from just market conditions at a time of incredible volatility and differentiation in terms of the business mix of these different banks? You need both. And I think that what we haven't spoken about this morning is that the large banks have increased headcount. And yet we've seen in the capital markets that normally by September October, you're going to be talking up a very healthy pipeline for the fourth quarter. That's not likely to happen this year. And then the hard decisions have to be made, whether you need to cut back some staffing in the capital markets, particularly in areas of investment banking. Ken Leon there of CFRA on the latest from city JP Morgan out a little bit earlier Morgan Stanley as well. Here's a very classy letter from the now former chancellor quasi-quarting dear Prime Minister. You have asked me to stand aside as your chancellor. I have accepted just working through this letter. Just want to get to a couple of paragraphs that a pertinent to the news will probably hear later this month when we get the announcement of the budget. It is important now as we move forward to emphasise your government's commitment to fiscal discipline. The medium term fiscal plan is crucial to this end and I look forward to supporting you and my successor to achieve that from the back benches. He concludes Lisa by saying the following. We have been colleagues and friends for many years in that time. I've seen your dedication and determination. I believe your vision is the right one. It has been an honour to serve as your first chancellor. Your success is this country's success and I wish you well. Whatever you think about the policies announced by this chancellor in the last few weeks that is a very classy letter from quasi-quarting. And a vote of confidence saying Liz trust should remain being your first chancellor indicating there will be a second or a third. And this question of basically saying I still believe in what we're trying to get at. Very classy also confirming that he is exiting and putting it squarely on Liz trust as her decision frame to do so. We can head over to number 10 downish street and catch up with Lizzy burden over in London. Lizzy the reaction on the ground where you are. I have to sage on the other thing that strikes me about that letter is that quasi-quarting repeatedly refers to her vision. And remember Quarting is Liz trust's political soul mate. So getting rid of him would leave many people asking how much is really changing. And that is why the reports from the Times and the telegraph are that she's going to replace him as chancellor with Jeremy Hunt. He finished runner up to Boris Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest. He's previously been foreign secretary, health secretary.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2795,2022-10-14 12:10:38
14570," Me Hunt. He finished runner up to Boris Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest. He's previously been foreign secretary, health secretary. But this would be seen as a sign of Liz Truss reaching out to other parts of her party, which is something she has not done up to now, which is perhaps why she's had such a difficult time getting Trussonomics not just pass markets, but pat through her party. Lizzie, do you have a sense of why this is happening so quickly? What exactly is going on? I mean, are there people just, you know, running through the halls of parliament with piles of paper throwing them up? I mean, what is exactly the mechanics of this morning that has been incredibly messy after an already messy, you know, 48 hours, etc? The irony is that after quasi-quarting was so flippant about the markets, saying, remember, they'll react as they will, blaming all the pound moves, guilt moves on international factors. It's been the market pressure that pushed for the cooperation tax U-turn that we're expecting Truss to announce at the press conference later. The markets, when that news came about yesterday, priced it in. And so we would expect a massive sell-off if they didn't go ahead with it. But now we're expecting even more U-turns to be announced. Got a bit excited there, because there was a car pulling up, but I have to tell you it's an empty one. But those both the financial pressure and also the pressure from the party. You'll remember Michael Goe, very dangerous senior member of the conservative party put the pressure on Lys Truss to return to U-turn on the top rate of income tax. It became inevitable that Lys Truss' party were not going to let her pass these measures of tax cuts when they're so unfunded through the House of Commons, so the pressure just mounted too much. Lysi, let's just finish on this one. And I think it's the next step here that man has so many people, particularly in the United Kingdom. This party's not doing well in the polls at all. You know that, I know that. Is it enough just to get rid of the Chancellor? When, as you say, in that letter by this Chancellor, these Lys Truss' policies too, she owns them. A fingerprint are all over the last month or so. How long can she stay on? And as this party go after her next? Well, is this enough? First of all, you may also see the sacking of Chris Filt, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who we interviewed at Torrey Party Conference just last week. He was supposedly the brains behind the top rate of income tax cut. You may also see Jacob Reesmark, the business secretary, going under the chop, because he reportedly disagreed with Truss over the idea of rage. Then he's going to be in charge of the economy. And he's going over the idea of raising benefits in line with earnings instead of inflation. Can Truss survive? Well, you have to ask what's the point of having this woman in number 10 Downing Street, who cannot get her vision for the economy, past the market or her own party. And there are reports that her own party is now looking to take her down as well. Lysi, this won't be the final time we catch up with you this morning. That's for sure. Lysi, burdened outside number 10. Has been sacked, coming up a little bit later this morning, get a go after the IMF sitting down with Bloomberg's Tom Keane, TK No-Down, leading off on the IMF's thoughts on what's taken place in the UK over the last month from New York. This is Bloomberg. Keeping you up today with news from around the world with the first word, I'm Lisa Mateo. Well, as you've heard, the UK's quasi-quarting has confirmed he will step down as Chancellor. The Times is reporting Jeremy Hunt is lying to take up, to take over after the position. Bloomberg has learned Lysi Trust expects to hold a news conference later today, pronouncing plans to reverse parts of her economic strategy. And that U-turn follows weeks of market pressure to explain how she'll pay for her program. Attention is focused in recent days on whether trust will cancel plans to freeze corporation tax next year. Instead of raising it as privacy planned. Kroger says it has agreed to buy rival Albertsons in a deal worth and enterprise value of $24.6 billion. It joins a two largest US operators of traditional supermarkets.

Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take, powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Lisa Mateo. This is Bloomberg. The company's plan to sell as many as 375 stores through a spin-off. The company's plan to sell as many as 375 stores through a spin-off. The company's plan to sell as many as 375 stores through a spin-off. The company's plan to sell as many as 375 stores through a spin-off. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children, but some of the most recognizable buildings by, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building. That's the statement. The symbol of a city is a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art. It's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world. So it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. When US inflation numbers are released, your race is set. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg, your global business authority.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2797,2022-10-14 12:18:58
14572," the downshift just keeps getting pushed out. Now it looks like we're going into extra innings. Nobody covers the economy like Bloomberg. Your global business authority. For the Fed, they're strapping themselves in for this. They're expecting some increase in volatility because the world is uncertain. I don't suspect the folks of the Fed yet see evidence. So there's something that's not working in markets at the point where they're worried about it. Seth Carpenter there, the global chief economist of Morgan Stanley, live from New York City this morning. We are about 12 minutes away from retail sales in America. 24 hours afterwards, we had CPI 24 hours later and this market. Well, I'm still relic. We were down 2.4 percent. At one point on the S&P 500, we closed the session up about 2.6 percent. The futures on the S&P look like this down about a tenth of 1 percent. You're able to lower by 6 basis points to 387.89. About 24 hours ago when we got that printly, so you're not lower, they were absolutely ripping higher. At the front end and right the way through the curve. This trading type of activity does not give anyone confidence. I think that it's fair to say that given the whips are action and the lack of logic behind it, there is not a cohesive theme driving activity. People point to some issues with algorithmic trading. To me, it indicates though a jumpiness that makes this market prone to a much bigger move one way or another. Jim Poulson joins us now. Chief Investments strategist at Loothhold Group. Jim, you've had a day to try and make sense of this. You've had more than 12 hours. So let's go. At one point this market had given back 50 percent of the post-pandemic rally. And Jim, and then we just ripped off the bottom. Yes, today. Jim, what happened? Well, you know, I don't know either Jonathan. I would say a few things though. One is, you know, that market, bear markets don't generally end under conditions that make a lot of sense. Usually the news is horrifically bad and you feel helpless. And there's no solution to the problems you face. And then the market starts going up for no reason whatsoever. That's kind of the case in most of them. Do you think in March 23rd of 2020 when market had dropped, you know, 35 percent in 23 days that all of a sudden took off that anyone really thought that was, that was it was over. Same thing in March of 09, for example, when it finally took off. It took a long time to convince all of us perhaps that maybe, maybe it's behind us. So it often takes off when it doesn't make much sense. And the news is still horrific. Oftentimes it's when the news is the worst it's been. So it could be that. It's a kind of move on a technical basis that could be the type of thing starting a new bowl. Or it could just be a dead cat bounce on a very oversold market. You know, very oversold market for the last five days and that it takes the temporary bounce. I don't know either. I would say one other thing. It's someone interesting to me that we sit here in the S&P 500 right now. It's the same level it was at the June lows four or four months ago. And yet think of all the bad stuff that's happened over that period. Multiple massive rate heights by the Fed, big increase in yields across the curve. A lot of hawkish talk, increased recession fears, increased inflation fears. And yet the market has not gone down. And I think it's it might say something about how washed out this market is. We've got an S&P 500 down 25% already that's selling on a trailing multiple lower than 70% of the time since 1990. We've got a terrible sentiment on Wall Street, not much better sentiment on Main Street. And we've got a Fed that's orchestrating a monetary policy that just seems clearly unsustainable. It just can't last long. It's going to break something. Jim, this is where I wanted to go because I remember the last time you came on and you said that you're bullish partly because the Fed was going to pause and that people are overzealous about their expectations of the Fed funds rate. Have you rethought that at all given the CPI data that we got yesterday? Yeah, I mean, they're not going to pause this month. You're exactly right, Lisa. And they're looking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2798,2022-10-14 12:23:49
14573," given the CPI data that we got yesterday? Yeah, I mean, they're not going to pause this month. You're exactly right, Lisa, and they look pretty fervent through you in going to four and a half. I just think they're going to be forced to, you know, before too long, and that might be what the market is kind of thinking as well and why it's kind of hanging in there. Let me give one other thing to think about here. You know, the two years, you know, in the last couple of days, the one year, and the feds are going to go ahead and do at least 75, you know, in the early November. But look at what's going on with the five year, the 10 year, and the 30 year. Those are below where they were before the CPI report came out. So we got two days back to back of horrific inflation boards, and a big part of the curve is no longer responding. What might that imply? It might be that the Fed doesn't blink, but maybe the bond market blinks. In other words, if there's bad inflation reports that charge the Fed to move rates even higher, you might start to escalate a recession fears over inflation fears, and that'll bring bond buyers in. If I'm get convinced that the feds caused a recession, I'm going to start buying bonds at 4% on the 10 year. You buy bonds, you want to buy stocks when that happens, Jim? That's the question. Yeah. It is a question. I think you do, Jonathan. But my point is, the Fed might be stopped because it can no longer raise rates across most of the curve, because they're thinking the policy is going to create a recession, so it brings bond buyers into the place. And that could stop the Fed, too. But I just think the stock markets washed out, and it wasn't what's interesting. It wasn't only the stock market the blink yesterday. It was the bond market, too, or at least a big chunk of the bond market that said, no. I know the Fed's going to do what's going to do, but where yields are done going up, and stock markets are done going down. We'll see if that holds, but it's kind of interesting over the last couple days. It's so bad they're going to have to hike, and that's going to mean they're going to have to cut, because it's so bad. You see where this is going? That's right. I mean, the dovish market. Jim, you killed me. The more aggressive they get. Jim, you killed me. Come on. The more aggressive they get, the more you're going to bring recession fears is the primary fear over inflation. And I want to buy stocks on recession fears before earnings have collapsed, Jim. Well, let me say, I just recently put this out earlier this week, John, that I looked back to 1948. We've had 12 recessions. I looked at how much had the market, you know, sort of pre-forecasted a recession coming in the past. The average of the median decline in the stock market prior to the first month of this recession starting was about 5.5 percent or something. We're down 25 percent. We're down five times more than the average market decline prior to a recession. So there's a lot of bad already booked in this stock market. So we could have a recession, and I'm not so sure the market has to go all out lower. Now certainly if it's a deep one and 08 or 2000, certainly it's going lower. But I don't think we're headed for that. We're headed for more of a mild recession. And maybe that's priced in already, and what really matters at this point is if the rate structure stops going up, I think the stock market starts to look a lot better as well. Jim Poston, F. Luke Holtgrove, Jim with a constructive view. Thank you, sir. It's good to catch up. That's the constructive view. The less bearish view on this market right now. And to be fair to him, as Gina Martin Adams was saying right now, the earnings are coming in less bad than people thought. Shops suggesting that there is something else going on. And we've already priced in much worse. The flip side is if things get bad enough that the Fed has to go more harshly than ostensibly, there will be some economic damage in the meantime that would be a scenario that would be more difficult to digest. So it's sort of a very difficult thing to do. Did you see what Michael Hartner of Bank of America called this? What do you call it? This movie yesterday. He said it was a bearhuck. It's just a hug for the bears. I felt it. A bearhuck. Coming up, get a go for that. First deputy manager director at the IMF. A hug from the bears for the bulls. No, I don't think so. I don't think they're making my chugs. From New York, Mrs. Blimpake.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2799,2022-10-14 12:28:12
14574," It's playing back. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. You've got to explain this one to me. What does it mean when the White House says we're watching markets carefully? It means they have a Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. They have. You've seen it. Lots of Bloombergs. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. I've seen the Bloomberg. What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? Does it mean? What does it mean? It means they have a Bloomberg. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, hide the water rises, hide the mountains shake. All of who will remain? We will never. No, now we will never. No. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. Great question. Great question. That's going to be the best question I get online. Bloomberg Television. Top Experts, great questions. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building it. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. I'm curious to see what's going on. We are looking for some new resources. We are looking for new resources. USA's retail sales come out in about 8 seconds time. If I knew the data and I told you right now just whispered it, would you know what to do with it? Could you tell me where the equity market was going to close? No. It's another problem. I can tell you the numbers around now. month of September last month they were up by three tents. The forecast was for a two-tenths gain. Take out autos and you've got a one-tenth gain.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2800,2022-10-14 12:33:20
14575," for the month of September, last month they were up by three tents. The forecast was for a two-tenths gain. Take out autos and you've got a one-tenth gain compared to a three-tenths decline in the prior month. But the retail sales control group is what we tend to look at and it is a healthy four-tenths of 8%. You take out autos gasoline, the things that that are counted in other areas of GDP. And so it does look like a reasonably healthy gain of four-tenths compared to flat the prior month. We take a quick look here at what move this month. Gasoline, I think of course, is likely to be down. Gasoline stations were down 1.4%. That's not as bad as the 5.2% decline of the prior month. Looking at motor vehicles down four-tenths. So you see gas and motor vehicles really dragging that headline number down. Food stores up four-tenths on the month health and personal care stores up half a percent as were clothing stores and clothing accessory stores. General merchandise up seven-tenths department stores 1.3%. None-store retailers declined in August but they rose half a percent in the month of September. Food services and drinking places up by half a percent. So fairly wide range of solid gains in retail sales and a lot of economists have been pointing to numbers from the major banks showing that people were still still had significant deposits from last year's stimulus and we're still using credit cards to buy things. So right now the consumer is hanging in there probably also a function of the fact that the job growth is still strong. Mike Sitzai, let's go through these numbers then. Futures basically unchanged on the S&P 500. Big a bid comes into the bond market. You'll to lower by about six or seven basis points on a 10 year maturity to 388. Least sort of the front end we're down about five basis points. So let's call it 440 after breaching 450 on a two-year just yesterday. That doesn't make sense with respect to retail sales because stronger than expected spending would allow the Fed to go more harshly. What it does make sense with is the import price index that actually declined more than people expected and this idea that we're getting imports for cheaper in the United States because the dollar is stronger and that has a disinflationary effect and I do wonder John how much that's going to play into the calculus here in terms of the push pull of how far the Fed goes. I couldn't make sense of yesterday I'm not going to try and make sense of today. And I'll just we can talk about this better reserve. Yes. Well I mean look we've both said it in the past haven't we you can't define the data based on an intraday move in the market. No and I would agree with that I do think though this import price index is somewhat interesting. Mike McKee joins us again. Mike I want you to react to this and set things up for November. I'm not sure what's left now not really anything at all. Go through what this Fed's going to be sitting gone when they're next meet. Well the one big piece of information that we will have at the end of the month is GDP for the third quarter the first estimate of that. And right now it's looking pretty good. The Atlanta Fed had us at the 2.7% growth which is quite a rebound from the 2 quarters of contraction that we had in the first half of the year. So you put it all together you've got strong job growth you've got a healthy GDP you've got consumers still spending and we still have inflation. So it does suggest as Lisa mentioned that you probably have to do more if you're the Fed. Now does that mean a higher terminal rate hard to say does it mean they may go faster. They're locked in for 75 in November but then they might do another 75 in December if this keeps up. So two sort of parallel stories come out of this one is that they may have to do more and two is that they may be able to get a soft landing out of this so they can get some movement on inflation. Hey Mike good to catch up. Mike McKee there breaking down the retail sales number after CPI came out yesterday. We've got to break things down in the UK as well. I guess things are breaking down in the UK. We're hearing from the Times again that Jeremy Hunt will be the UK's Chancellor Quarting was sacked a little bit earlier this morning. Jeremy Hunt the former Foreign Secretary according to reporting in the UK will be the UK's Chancellor. We're set to hear from the Prime Minister potentially at 230 local time now. That's the latest kind of I'm hearing 230 local times so about 930 in New York. TK I know over in DC it's just as big",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2801,2022-10-14 12:36:47
14576," who 30 local time now. That's the latest guy that's I'm hearing. 230 local time, so about 930 in New York. TK, I know over in DC, it's just as busy as it has been for us through this morning. Let me just say, John, you're just absolutely killing it this morning. I mean, you guys have led with the collation of all of this historic moment for the United Kingdom. I'm sure we'll continue to do that for through the day with Guy Johnson in London. It is an historic IMF meeting as well. Any number of topics to speak to, Guy to go up and ask about, the first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund. And as I ended yesterday, Guy to with a managing director on the United Kingdom meeting with the former chancellor and with the prime minister, just a few days ago, I must begin there with you. Your research capability says, what is the best first practice for this fractured government in the United Kingdom? What's the best first step for them to get to some form of new stability? So Tom, first day, it's a pleasure to join you here. We are following the developments in the UK. And of course, there are issues which we don't comment on. We do hear that there is some recalibration likely to happen on the policies, but we don't have any details. We'll see what comes next. And then we will be able to comment more on those. Thank you for those comments. And we'll get much more on that. I'm sure from the managing director as well. Folks, I've got this up here. This is how quickly things are moving at the international monetary fund. Released within the hour is a definitive weekend read on how countries should respond to the strong dollar, gopeneff pulling an all night around us. It's wonderful and with wonderful charts as well. What I see within your note is you speak of financial amplification leading to instabilities. Can the strong dollar amplify the world's risks of instability? So when you have sizable movements in the dollar, it has very sizable implications for the global economy, because it's so dominant in trade and finance. But the important thing to keep in mind is that there are fundamentals that are driving these large movements. They seem very quick. They seem very steep. The differences in the path of monetary policy, tightening is one factor. The differences in high energy prices are affecting countries is another factor. So I think this is going to be a bit of a rocky right for countries, but they will have to adjust to it. So they have to use their own monetary policy tools to be able to keep inflation. We're going to speak to Robin Roger here about emerging markets. Let me stay with the major countries with you, Dr. Gopeneff. And let's look at the Yen experiment. All of this meeting in the world, John Farrow, is transfixed by Yen 147. What is the council of you and your chief economist? To the Japanese to extricate themselves from their unique yield curve control experiment? There were fundamental reasons for that particular divergence that we see in the currency. Japan has decided to stay the course in terms of keeping interest rates low. While the Fed has decided to stay the course in terms of raising interest rates very decisively to bring down inflation. And that, of course, is one of the primary drivers of these different of the fact that the Yen has lost value relative to the dollar. Now, of course, over time, monetary policy will have to figure out what the best course is, depending upon inflation development in Japan. But as of now, I believe, given the diverging trends, you know, currency movements will look like they do now. With all of your expertise, if Japan capitulates to a more normal monetary policy, and Yen goes strong, 148, 150, just as a pick a number out of thin air, 129, what will that do to the Pacific Rim financial system? We have to look into that and see how what happens in a disruptive manner, it happens in an orderly manner. We always have exchange rate movements all the time. When you have big movements and exchange rates, the problems that come up is when you have firms or banks that have borrowed multiple currencies and have been sufficiently hedge themselves. So those get affected. But if you hedge yourself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2802,2022-10-14 12:41:04
14577," have funds or banks that have borrowed and multiple currencies and have been sufficiently hedge themselves. So those get affected. But if you hedge yourself, I mean, these are movements that you should be using. Because of breaking news in the United Kingdom, we're going to ask one more question. I really want to give John and Lisa in New York enough time with the flow of news there. I did a careful read of this blog. Folks, again, this blog is the Read of the Week. And look on Twitter. I'll have it out with the IMF's website. Nowhere in here, do I see that you were at the Plaza Accord? You don't mention the Plaza Accord. How does it grizzled pro like you respond to the media of silliness, the romance back to 1984? How do you respond to people we need another Plaza Accord? I think we are. That's not where we are. And frankly, when the Plaza Accord worked at all, it was not just because there were announcements on currencies, but there was more signaling of coordination of other kinds of fiscal and monetary policies and so on. So now, I don't think we're going to have a Plaza Accord. Any time. What did you learn at these meetings? I'm fascinated how people's time frame is back 40 and 50 years, not back 50 years. What has been your observation at these meetings and the tension here? I think there is a clear recognition that inflation is stubborn. It's persistently high. And I do think central banks are very careful. A lot to gain stumble on the fact that maybe this is all going to move correct itself automatically. So I think there is very much agreement on the single course. The second piece is about making sure monetary policy and fiscal policy are consistent, and they're both growing in the same direction, as opposed to pulling it up as a direction. And everybody is concerned with financial fragility in the sense of what could be lying in the dark corners and the shadows that we aren't aware of at this point. In different shadows in 2008, Geeta Gopinath. Thank you so much for joining Bloomberg today. Dr. Gopinath, the IMF first deputy managing director in New York. Lisa. Thank you so much, Tom. Great interview, as always, and fascinating to hear. The discussion around the importance of fiscal policy tightening in order to help monetary policy. It's just in response to the turmoil that we're seeing in the leadership at the UK, UK 30-year guilt yields down 4.4% after reaching 5% of the budget's days ago. Coming up, we have more from the IMF with our very own Tom Keane. This is Bloomberg.

In a video shot during the January 6th insurrection, the US House speaker said she wanted to punch President Trump if he showed up at the Capitol. Video released by CNN shows Pelosi in her office says the Capitol is about to come under assault. In the footage, Pelosi says, quote, my hope he comes, I'm going to punch him out, and I'm going to jail, and I'm going to be happy. Lawmakers want to question Trump about the 2021 riot and our demanding documents and testimony about his role. The move comes just weeks ahead of midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. Democratic Senator Rafael Warnoch and Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, are deadlocked in the Georgia race, just four weeks before the election. The candidates will face off in their first and only debate in Savannah tonight. Neither has managed a breakout in the pivotal contest. Georgia is a crucial state in the battle for control of the US Senate. Chinese censors have taken the extreme step of restricting the search term Beijing on social media. The move comes after a rare public announcement of President Xi Jinping. Photos and videos of two banners criticizing Xi and his strict COVID-0 policy are circulating on social media. Now, the protest comes days before Xi outlines his vision for China at the Communist Party Congress, at which he's expected to secure a precedent-defying third term.

So, is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. It's hard because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing, you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court, you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. What's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? You're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year. That would be great. But I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great. I think winning a championship is, it's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It had 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal. You did not get stronger that moment that you're lifting the barbell. You get stronger as your body is making repairs, making recovery. Recovery is a win and how you get fit or faster stronger. Recovery technology includes everything from massage guns and foam rollers to compression boots, hyperbaric chambers, cryo chambers, infrared sonas and even infrared pajamas. And athletes are partnering to become investors to take those products mainstream. When you look at tech and sports right now, it's completely innovating. The way training is going, completely changing the way recovery is going. I think sky's the limit as far as where it can go. But while some of these products can feel amazing, it can be difficult to differentiate between what really helps the body and what just tricks the mind.

14579," The most important task we have to secure our economies is to win the fight against inflation. And that means for central banks to show the resolve that is necessary. Down at the IMF, managing director Kristalina Giorgava speaking yesterday with our own Tom Keem, we're going to head down to Washington DC in just one second. We are getting more news, of course, out of 10 Downing Street, the latest coming from Prime Minister Liz Truss putting out a letter to Quasicuarteng thanking him for his service. Interestingly, she seems to reaffirm her commitment to the energy price guarantee and energy bill relief scheme, which she says will go down as one of the most significant fiscal interventions of modern times. It remains to be seen and we will see more later today about how much of their plan really has been pulled back in response to market volatility. Let's head back down to Washington DC, Tom Keem, with a very special guest, Tom. Lisa, thanks so much and I believe we have an important press conference in the 9 o'clock hour New York time with the Prime Minister, John Farrell, bringing you that on television and radio as well. Right now, in these unusual times, in an usual interview with Roger Ngarajan, he's former governor of the Central Bank of India and far more at the Booth School of Chicago, has provided two magnificent books of the era. He defined the crisis of 08 and 07 with fault lines and is the third pillar, which was my book of the summer one year, the third pillar has been shockingly pressuring about the technological and community changes of America, none of which we can talk about this morning for there is only one topic. The topic is the strong dollar, what it means for all of our Bloomberg surveillance audience and you with the great financial sophistication you have are watching cash in international overnight lines, which are called swap lines and the nations that don't have those instruments available. Tell us your study of liquidity right now. Well, I think this is a phenomenon which is across the board and you see it reflected in the problems in the UK right now. What is happening is the central banks flooded the markets with the most liquid asset on earth, which is central bank reserves, tens of trillions during the pandemic. Now they were drawing that cash from those markets. So what happens when they withdraw that cash? Banks in the meantime have written a lot of claims on that cash, a lot of people depend on that cash for final settlement. That cash is shrinking and as a result things are getting very tight in financial markets. If you look at every measure of liquidity, it is off the charges back to the March 2020 levels in the United States. Think of what happened in the UK. You have these pension funds, right. Suddenly you have to make margin calls. They need cash, but nobody is willing to lend them that cash. And so what they do, they sell assets. As they sell assets, those assets fall in value and you see the interest rates go up. I think the problem there was of course the government action, but you can think about accidents waiting to happen across the world, including for emerging markets. Let's let this. Let's talk first about the others like the UK that have so-called swap lines where there's a confidence to go to the central bank of the United States. Is that system working now or do you have a fear that we could fail with a larger more sophisticated nations? Well, I think for now the Federal Reserve has made commitments to a number of countries. It's the countries that are outside that system which have bigger problems because when they need the cash, what are they going to do? They're going to sell in their stock of fresh trees, their reserves. And that creates a price impact in various markets. Right now, I think they're managing. Right. But if there is a big sort of demand for cash, as for example in the UK, basically you get more selling. You and I started Stanley Fisher 101 in the crises of previous decades and people here at these meetings make clear they're looking back 40 and 50 years. Is EM different this time? Is EM more prepared for these liquidity crises? It is more prepared because it has built reserves during the time of easy money. It's seen that story happen again and again. So the big EMs are better prepared.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2805,2022-10-14 12:54:01
14580," Prepared because it has built reserves during the time of easy money. It's seen that story happen again and again. So the big EMs are better prepared. Of course, the small EMs in the developing countries, not so. And for them, of course, the twin effects of high inflation, high food prices, that's hurting them a lot, high fuel and food. And so many of them are on the brink. This time, not so much liquidity, but default. They simply cannot service their debt. Right. They have people at the same time. Lisa from New York emails in and says, Tom, you've got to ask about yen and the Pacific Rim. Lisa, let's do that. Rago, very simply here, the Bank of Japan has an original experiment, which is not taught by Randall Crossner at booth. It's original. Week yen 1047. I've done the math. You've done the math. X number, more interventions, possible. At some point, that will break it. As I said, to Dr. Gopanath, we will see Yen go. 148 to 129 in a heartbeat. What does that do to Indonesia? What does that do to China? Well, any volatility in asset prices creates a problem somewhere. Now, in this case, when the yen strengthens significantly, it probably helps other countries a little bit. The problem, to some extent, is of people who have borrowed in yen at this point. And I'm thinking this is easy money. We can repair it effectively when the yen strengthens. That becomes a problem. The bigger problem is for people who are holding JGBs. I mean, think of what happens to them because supposing, you know, the bank of Japan has to move off its yield curve control because it's achieved its implementation objective. How does it move off? It's riding a tiger. It has to move off in small steps. But markets basically accelerate that movement. They know that you have to get off it. And therefore, what happens to JGB is a big price fall when the bank of Japan moves off. It's time for one more question. Unfortunately, they are riding a tiger. Is the tiger holds their party congress in China, literally tomorrow and this week as well. How does China fit into your view of Pacific Rim and around your India given their absolutely unique COVID strategy? Well, I think they're hurting themselves. And the question is, how do they move off given that this is so closely associated with President Xi? And it is creating opportunities for countries around the Pacific. Vietnam is benefiting as a China plus one. India is benefiting a little bit. But the real question is, what happens to China after this? How do they find a way to move off this? Or do they actually buy Western vaccines and start vaccinating their population with effective vaccines? That's the big question in front of them because they cannot continue with this strategy forever. Dr. Reagan, thank you so much. Greatly appreciate it. A former Reserve Bank of India Governor, Raghavan Rajan this morning as well. Lisa, it has been an extraordinary three days in Washington. It really has. Great job, Tom. And thank you for that. It has been an extraordinary day in Washington. It has also been an extraordinary day in the United Kingdom. The latest headline that Jeremy Hunt of the Rishi Sunak era has been named as the new UK Chancellor that comes after quasi-quarting, exited after just 38 days that makes him the shortest serving Chancellor to ever leave office alive in almost 200 years, just giving you a sense of the scope. We are seeing a bit of a stability at least, a bit in the pound, but still a bit weaker. Meanwhile, in a broader sense, markets have rebounded a little bit ahead of the open. Who knows? We'll let me be by the end of the day because things tend to swing around, bond yields lower and actually heading even lower on the heels of some of the recent economic data.

Live from New York City this morning, good morning, good morning, stocks are up, they can't down to the open. That's right now. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. training. This is Bloomberg, the open with Jonathan Perra. Live from New York City, we begin with the big issue. What a messy week. The CPI print yesterday was bad. It's really bad. Inflation was supposed to be moderating. The reality is we're seeing inflation very hot. We got a print that is moving in the wrong direction. We're in a situation here where we thought the Fed had made a one-off adjustment to get two policy rates up to 4.75%. This is presenting a real challenge for not only the Fed, but the broader economy. Unfortunately, the data are pointing to a more systemic issue. It is brutal. I think that's a good way to sum it up. Wage pressures are pushing into prices now. Now it looks like we're going into extra earnings. I definitely think we'll see another 75 base.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2807,2022-10-14 13:02:58
14582," It is brutal. I think that's a good way to sum it up. You know, wage pressures are pushing into prices now. Now it looks like we're going into extra earnings. I definitely think we'll see another 75-based point move in November. Of course, what we're seeing is this repricing in markets. The question now that we all have to ask ourselves is, is a 4.75% policy rate is that enough? That and how on earth have we rallied ripped off the lows of yesterday? We'll get to that in just a moment. My Miki Jo and just alongside Keri Lines might Miki the data of the last 24 ads. Very, very weird, very, very mixed. Inflation obviously still a problem. But this morning we get word that retail sales were not all that bad. They were flat out a headline basis because auto sales were down just a little bit and retail or gasoline sales were down just a little bit. But look at the retail control group. Up 4.10% of a percent for the month. That's basically what goes into GDP. And that was an improvement over the 2.10s gain in the month of August. So retail sales a little bit better, maybe boosted by the back to school spending. We don't know what the impact of Hurricane Ian is on these numbers yet, but we'll get a better handle as we get the revisions next month. But the other thing you have to take a look at is that the Fed's job is to clamp down on demand. And yet demand remains strong. Reasonably good retail sales. You look at the at a Fed GDP down numbers. They're expecting about 2.7% for the third quarter. And payrolls remain strong. So it definitely tells a story that the Fed hasn't done enough yet or at least what the Fed has done hasn't started to hit the economy. So the question you raised about whether they have target that's high enough is still a live question. Michael, some ways you've got the easy job. Kelly, lies against the hard job. Kelly, you've got to explain. After everything Mike's just said, why not this market ripped the way it ripped yesterday and followed through in the same way today? I'm not sure anyone can have a definitive answer to that question, John. There's a number of things you could potentially think about in theory, including just market mechanics, option activity, potentially some short covering. There also is, to Mike's point, about a softish landing, maybe more optimism building if some data is holding in there that the Fed might actually be able to pull this off. Another interesting point I read from Greg Valleere over at AGF was the idea that the inflation data yesterday was so bad, it may mean Republicans do better in the midterms and therefore it's better for financial markets. I don't know which ones, right? This market has been incredibly puzzling and it's not just the equity market either. The bond market has been on quite a wild ride. Today it is that yields are moving lower. We're down about six basis points on the 10 year to 387. On the week were essentially unchanged in the belly of the curve and in the 10 year, they'll look at the short end up 10 basis points on the two year and that has everything to do with the repricing of expectations for the terminal that this market has held underway. Remember back in the beginning of September when we thought it was going to be 4%, we're now 100 basis points north of that 5%, ultimately on Fed funds, is what the market is currently pricing in. Then of course the question becomes how long they're going to stay there and if any softness appears in the economy, that will cause them to pivot, which comes back to the health of the consumer and what retail sales data realistically can tell us about it. I just want to issue a warning here that you have to keep in mind the impact of higher prices and you see this at the corporate level Pepsi. Earlier this week, volumes down basically across the board, 1.75% in total. Sales though, up 16%. It is pricing power, John. Going to be very important for this earnings season as well. Kelly, nice. Thank you alongside Mike McKee to the two of you. Thank you very much. Futures right now, up around 1%. Just keep your eyes on some of the headlines coming out of Russia as well. Vladimir Putin in the last couple of minutes, this report, Putin saying that more massive missile strikes against Ukraine, not necessary. More headlines still to come from that. And as they pour in, I'll bring them to you. Futures up again then. We've ripped off the lows of yesterday. Zach Riff is a credit size joint. It's alongside Dan Tazuki of RBI advisors. And Dan, it's first to you. First up, you know where this is going. What on earth was that yesterday morning through this morning? Yeah, I don't have a great answer for you, John, but I think it's a lot of technicals, a lot of algos into an oversold market. So you're bound to get those types of moves, but I wouldn't read too much of those. I think we really won't be talking about that move in a week or two from now. Jordan Roshester, over at Nemura said this morning, he had this quote, if it doesn't smell right, it probably isn't. Zach, is it? It doesn't smell right. It doesn't feel right. And I think when we've gotten moves like this, that didn't make a lot of sense.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2808,2022-10-14 13:07:24
14583," If it doesn't smell right, it probably isn't. Zach, is it? It doesn't smell right. It doesn't feel right. And I think when we've gotten moves like this, that didn't make a lot of sense off the back of either an F1C decision or data like this, it is tenent to reverse. And so I think I agree with Dan that this is certainly a huge issue and hard to explain right now, but we won't be talking about it a week from now. Zach, what if you're wrong? How would you know? Well, I think that as you kind of get into the end of the week, here sifting through all of the data, the hot inflation print is concerning, but does it really change what the Fed is going to do in the near term? And while the market is pricing a much higher terminal rate, we think that's probably gone a little bit too far. 75 basis points in November seems like a done deal. We think 50 basis points is still the most likely outcome in December and could still see the Fed pausing from there. So I think if we get a little bit more balanced message out of the Fed after a long week of very hawkish messaging with the exception of Lil Brainerd, I think you could see that take hold and have it more realistic or balanced market reaction. We're here from Governor Waller a little bit later this morning. Later today, the reaction to CPI from the Fed coming up later. Dan, I want to come to you on a big question. It's the debate you've explored within RB and on this program as well. Are we making this secular transition to a regime of higher rates and higher inflation? Because the conversations I have are often dominated by people who believe this period is just an aberration and we return to the old pre-pandemic playbook. I know you and the team have pushed back against that view, Dan. So what's guiding that debate for you and the team internally? Well, John, I think, you know, I do, we are in the camp that we are in a new paradigm of higher inflation and higher interest rates. You know, the problem for investors, you know, over the next 12 months is that, you know, we're dealing with major, you know, not one, not two, not three, but four major macro fundamental transitions here. And that's just the first of them. I think, you know, so we're dealing with that transition at the same time. We're dealing with the major transition in market leadership. You know, the old guard of US large cap growth, we think that that's going away and we're in the process of transitioning away from that. We're also in the midst of transitioning away from surging profits and abundant liquidity to what's likely going to turn out to be a profit recession with a lot less liquidity. And at the same time, you know, if Zack's right on his view, which we would agree with on the Fed and interest rates, we think that the drivers of interest rates are going to be shifting here from inflation and the Fed to that of growth over the next six to 12 months. So with all those moving parts, you know, there's, it's very likely that it'll feel like over the next 12 months that the story of a higher interest rates and a higher inflation is, was transitory, is temporary because at the end of the day, inflation, cyclical, interest rates fall alongside that. So they tend to be cyclical. So if growth slows as we expect it will, you know, this secular story will feel like it's taking a break. But you saw that in the 70s, but they came roaring back as growth came roaring back. Zack, does any of that resonate with you? It does. And I think that we are having a shift higher in inflation and interest rates that could persist. And when we think about where we were prior to the pandemic, you had one and a half to 2% inflation. Perhaps two and a half percent inflation is the run rate. And when you think about what that means for where the policy rate settles in, if we're able to get to neutral and stay there, perhaps we have more like a three and a half percent Fed funds. Whereas back in 2018, we got to two and a half percent and had to reverse course. So I think there are some shifting dynamics in the market that will persist. But when you look at all in yields from a corporate credit perspective, things are looking pretty interesting. And when you think about getting through these last two months of a very difficult year, looking ahead, things look like there's opportunities out there to get yield in places that had historically been much lower over the past couple of years. So we think things are going to look attractive and you could even start to see spreads narrow at the end of this year and into early 2023. So Zach, just how many understand the glide path for growth through next year? You expect spreads to narrow potentially an into economy that's still rolling over? So we think that you're going to have slow growth below potential, but credit fundamentals are strong and you're coming into a period where cash flow generation has been strong. Maturities over the next couple of years are reasonable. So while we do expect growth to slow, we're not calling for.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2809,2022-10-14 13:11:40
14584," coming into a period where cash flow generation has been strong. Uh, uh, maturities over the next couple of years are reasonable. So while we do expect growth to slow, we're not calling for a recession at this point. And given the relatively sturdy fundamental credit backdrop, we think that results in a spread narrowing now where we could be wrong, I think is if inflation is even hotter than we expect, the Fed has to tighten more and we go into a recession, in which case I think spreads narrow. And what you might still be able to eke out decent total returns, access returns, are going to be challenged in that kind of environment. Zach, you're wondering what's going to happen with market functioning? It's all you worried about that in any way, shape or form, because the conversation we've had over the last couple of weeks has been primarily focused around what's happened in the UK. I've asked the question a few times. What are you more surprised by? The announcement from the UK government, or the fact that $45 billion of tax cuts, $45 billion pounds worth of tax cuts, has done this much damage to the market. Zach, I hear a lot about how resilient balance sheets are, and how decent fundamentals are. And then I look at the fragility of the system over the last couple of weeks, and I'm scratching my head, Zach, just how resilient is this system? That's a great point, John, and that's something that we're certainly seeing in the treasury market as measures of liquidity have gotten much worse, as quantitative tightening has picked up. And so it's caused us to wonder, will the Fed have to reverse course on QT the same way the Bank of England did? And we don't expect to hear any big fiscal changes, even if there is a turnover to the Republican side with the midterm election. So it seems like for now, a big shift, causing the Fed to stop its QT program, or even start buying bonds. We're not expecting that at this point, but it's something that we're looking at as liquidity has worsened. It's even something that Secretary Yellen commented on recently, after just a week or two ago, saying she hadn't seen liquidity issues. So it's definitely something that we're focused on, but from the corporate bond market side, we've still priced nearly a trillion plus this year. And so there is still liquidity out there, deals are getting done. But we're going to keep an eye on that going forward. Dan, is something I've asked this one, that place that brought it up. It's QT still going at the Fed when we kick off 23. Is that something they have to abandon? We've seen what's happened with the Bank of England. We've seen the struggles with the ECB earlier this summer. They had to come up with a mechanism to cap yield on the periphery. Dan, do you think they're still doing QT in 23? I think they probably will be, but you make a really good point, John. I think, you know, listen, there's this kind of saying that's going around that everybody's talking about, the Fed's going to keep raising rates and keep tightening until they break something. We're getting closer to that breaking point more likely. I mean, you've already seen sort of a shot across the bow in the UK. If rates do go much higher, or the economy slows much more, or the markets go down more, it's likely that you're going to see more stress in the system. And those signs of stress are going to potentially give the Fed pause. It's not our base case scenario. But, you know, the more that we go down this road, you know, the risk of those those type of events is certainly increasing. That's the type of thing that will get the Fed to reverse course. Hey, Dan, Zach, stick with us, won't you? We heard from Mr. Hartnet of Bank of America a little bit early this morning. He called it a bear hug. I think a hug from the bears for the balls, perhaps. This is what he said. In addition to the big low, which he expects in 23, not this year. Everyone expects the Fed to cut. Just ain't the case today. The market is so oversold and investors are so cashed up, it adds up to a decent counter-rally, but the ultimate lows ain't seen yet. Michael Hartnet of Bank of America. Future's right now up about 1.4 percentage point. Coming up on this program, what are 24 hours for Quartec? What I'm totally focused on is on delivering on the mini budget, making sure that we get growth back into our economy. I'm not going anywhere. Well, he just got sacked.

14585," China's military power has been growing at an incredible speed over the last 20 years. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. In terms of sphere of influence, we absolutely know that China wants to be dominant in Asia. So there is a target to get to that point, to be a military that is appear to the greatest militaries in the world by 2035. The competition for influence is a global one. And through a multi-decade trajectory fueled by planning, money, and pragmatism, China is building a military that allows it to shape the 21st century just as the US shaped the 20th century. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. The idea of the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg. That is a great question. Bloomberg television. Top experts, great questions. What I am focused on is delivering on the mini budget, making sure we get growth back into our economy. That was yesterday. British politics, absolutely brutal. Chancellor Quarteng accepting a request from Prime Minister Liss Trust to step down. News conference expected in about 15 minutes from now, along with the potential reversal of her economic plan. The team coverage starts right now with Lizzie Burden, on number 10 down the street, alongside Guy Johnson in London. What is the Prime Minister's first to you? Interesting comments from Philip Hammond, the former Chancellor earlier. I hope the Prime Minister does not think the problem can be solved by getting rid of the Chancellor. He also said that he thinks trust can survive because he does not think that the Tories would want a general election. As the polls suggest at the moment, it would be total wipe out for the Conservatives and it would be a new era for Labour. Lizzie, can you guide me through what happens in 14 minutes? Do we get a statement? Is it a news conference? Are there questions to get the reversal of the economic plan? What is next? We are expecting questions after a statement. The fact that Liz Truss has sacked Quarteng and we did actually see him leaving number 10 down the street in a car earlier down into the street where there is an extinction rebellion protest, the climate change protestors. We are expecting, because she has sacked him, it gives political cover to make big reversals on this money budget much further than just the corporation tax cut. And really, she is going to need to do that since she has said she will not cut public spending further if she wants to balance the books and restore market credibility. We may also hear more about the sackings at the Treasury. It has been announced that Chris Philt, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is being replaced with Edward Arger. There could be curtains for Jacob Reesmark, the business secretary as well, a bit of a Treasury bloodbath. Because really, this is the moment where Liz Truss needs to reset her government if she has any hopes to stay in number 10. And Guy, here is me thinking we would be talking about Governor Bailey today. Yep. Well, I don't think his jobs completely over yet. We will see what happens on Monday morning. But certainly, the movement in the guild market does make the Governor's job a little bit easier. Will we need to see further announcements for him next week? We will wait and see. Will we see some sort of temporary halt, maybe John, to the QT program in some way?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2811,2022-10-14 13:19:52
14586, yeah uh... will we need to see further announcements of him next week we will wait and see could we see some sort of temporary halt maybe john to the qt program in some ways that would be logical i think we'll hear will wait for you from Jeremy hunt not entirely sure uh... where Jeremy hunter is right now but we'll wait and see what exactly happens uh... in terms of his appointment of what policies he's going to be pursuing this feels like a coalition this is like a coalition government now john you've got the the trust wing uh... and the the soon at wing it effectively in power together in the form of Jeremy hunt uh... analyst trust it's going to be really interesting to see how ultimately this works uh... and the kind of policies that he's going to bring he's much more centrist will the government uh... that will the government allow him to deliver what he wants to deliver will the market to accept what he wants to deliver i think there's a lot of unknown still here and that's going to make life more a little bit more difficult for the government the bank of england guy and please you went to policy at the bank of england of course the operation this supposed to win today the guilt market operation announced in the last week or so what's happening at the end of the month is qt of hsbc wrote in the ft earlier this week that there might be a ways around this that they can maybe tighten up the maturities that they use to sell perhaps at the front end given the average duration of the guilt market something like thirteen to fourteen years maybe the dm mo the demand is from offices can bring that in this well guy can you go through the options available to both the dm o the treasury in the b.o.y. as they go forward from here that there are certainly more demand at the front end uh... the u.k. has extended out its its maturity profile quite significantly over the over the last few years there is probably more demand at the front end how the bank would manage that i think would remain to be seen but certainly it seems slightly counterintuitive doesn't it to basically support the long end over a limited period of time and effectively within a matter of days be effectively selling back into that that longer duration portion of the market so maybe we do get some sort of a tweak here in terms of the strategy uh... with the leaderation that that is going to be uh... part of the qt program well maybe they just maybe just put a whole thing on hold for now and basically focus mainly mainly on raising rates i don't know yet but but whether or not those two things can be made to be compatible i think remains to be seen and i think that's the challenge for the bank of england at this point a guy let's catch up soon alongside lazy bird and guy johnson no doubt will catch up with them in a few minutes time because we said to hear from the prime minister it about ten minutes time potentially exactly this dance is a key bank with a sack how long does it take to rebuild the credibility that's been lost in the last couple of weeks it's been a while couple weeks and you have to imagine it's going to take some time certainly they're taking steps that needed to be taken it'll be interesting to see what actually happens with the policy they put forth that's certainly going to be key and the bank of england dodge the bullet i was with you john i cannot believe that andrew baili made those statements earlier this week but it seems like he's on the winning end so far again we'll see how things go on monday i think we're going to still see a lot of volatility from here and it's really going to come down to how the fiscal policy plans change going forward down i want to tie this into the equity market is when i got back to an earlier point of yours you're thinking about how the leadership might change in equity market the next regime of this and typically the allocation was very very biased towards the us over the last ten years precisely because that's where the big tech heavyweights were was about the breakdown of the weightings of the s and p five hundred down as i think about international if that's part of this new leadership story perhaps i'm looking at europe which is on a in a mess i'm looking at the uk which is in a mess and i'm looking at china which is deep deep deep into the unknown danis the international story part of the new leadership in the next regime yeah i think it's uh... it's it's it's certainly a part of that story i think uh... there's a lot of reasons to believe uh... you know international could do phenomenal over the next decade you know certainly it feels bad now but that's always how it starts i mean that's why you know there's a scarcity of capital needs markets uh... you know go back to the you know the wake of the tech bubble in the u.s. i mean u.s. was you know blowing everybody away uh... we had just come out of the asian financial crisis yet that's that ushered in the leadership of emerging markets for the next decades right so i think you could very much see you know what crate was crisis now you know normalizing away or the next ten years and that being a big part of the story uh... for international but it's not just that story i mean you have this massive move in currencies which is unlikely to continue kidding,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2812,2022-10-14 13:24:42
14587," being a big part of the story for international, but it's not just that story. I mean, you have this massive move in currencies, which is unlikely to continue over the next 10 years. So, currency can go from a major headwind for those markets to a tailwind at the same time, valuations, which is a terrible timing indicator, but a very powerful predictor of long-term returns is giving you fire-sale prices on most regions outside the U.S. I mean, the rest of the world trades at like 10 or 11 times earnings. You're hard pressed to find a market that trades about 12. People are talking about how cheap the U.S. has gotten when it's only back in line, more or less, with its historical average. So, valuations that look best predictor of long-term returns yet, and you also have this horrible sentiment toward international and there's reasons to be optimistic on growth, to be optimistic on currencies. I think that's a recipe for some outperformance in a lot of these regions. Jens, get some rest. We've got to do this again on Monday. Dan Suzuki, Zach Griffiths, to the both of you. Thank you.

14588," We were thinking big from the beginning. I mean the reason that I was interested in doing this in the first place was a much bigger challenge than making a comfortable shoe or doing something in the fashion industry as a narrow opportunity. We thought that there was a big leadership opportunity. We looked around at an industry where there was 20 billion pairs of sneakers made every single year. And it was 100% made from plastic and the hides from cows. And it was terrible for the environment. And we thought that we could offer something to consumers that was differentiated in the way it feels more comfortable, higher performance. And do that because we use sustainable materials. And in doing so, we could take a really interesting leadership opportunity and grab that and use that to tell a totally different story and compete on a totally different vector than what the rest in the industry were doing.

The big banks with earnings this morning. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, city. Not my job to keep up with this. It's Shanali Basak. She joins us now. Hey, Shanali. A lot to parse through, John. Let's start with some of the biggest topics on Wall Street. Savings rates is one of them. JP Morgan asked right off the bat whether you're going to see higher savings rates for consumers in their port and impact on their deposit betas. Listen, they said it depends on competitive positioning plus that lag and interest rate rises. So let's see how much of those actually go up for consumers. I want to also talk about the areas that Jamie Dimon sees cracks in the market. He says he doesn't necessarily see systemic risks, but he drew some areas of concern. And that includes in the dollar and emerging markets. And he talked about leverage loans as well. He said that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2814,2022-10-14 13:33:14
14589," But he drew some areas of concern, and that includes in the dollar and emerging markets, incredible. And he talked about leverage loans as well, though he said that the market isn't yet clear, but JP Morgan is not heavily exposed to that market. So that can explain to you a little bit why you didn't see a lot of write downs in this quarter. You didn't see it from Morgan Stanley. You didn't see it from City Group. But the question is, roll forward into the fourth quarter. Are they going to take those write downs moving forward? Now on their securities portfolio, that $1 billion worth of mark downs that you saw is JP Morgan in the market here. They bought some securities. They sold some securities, especially when it came to mortgages. Jamie Diamond has told investors that it's good for them. It's good for their capital return. He's getting questions as well, John, about what future profitability looks like. He said he's going to do damn good in a recession. Let me clarify that for a second. I'll have to say that on television. I think you can. You just did. Sorry, Julie. And so if we do, what he means by that is they may adjust their 17% return on tangible common equity goal a little bit, but they should be able to reach that goal in the face of all these headwinds that he has consistently outlined. I understood the sentiment. It was well received. Sean Ali, we're going to do this all over again on Monday, okay? We are. Sean Ali, Basak, thank you. Joining us now, Beds, David George. David, you left the bed with me, sir, because in a moment I have to go and hear from the Prime Minister in the UK and when that starts, we're going to break away from this. But David, first of all, your number one takeaway from this morning, please. Overall, the results were very good. The interest income, really the bright spot and really showing the true leverage of these fed rate hikes on bank earnings and it's having a meaningful impact on revenue trends. And we've seen that flow through this morning. You got a good forward look on the fourth quarter and beyond, David. Well, on the market side, John, it's obviously a bit unknown, although I think this volatility is actually good for FIC and good for trading so far in October. But there is very positive implications for net interest income in the fourth quarter as banks continue to get that full benefit of this fed rate tightening. David George, right on cue is the Prime Minister of the UK. I appreciate my personal experience. I know what it's like to grow up somewhere that isn't feeling the benefits of growth. I saw what that meant and I'm not prepared to accept that for our country. I want a country where people can get good jobs, new businesses can set up and families can afford an even better life. That's why from day one, I've been ambitious for growth. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the potential of this great country has been held back by persistently weak growth. I want to deliver a low tax, high wage, high growth economy. It's what I was elected by my party to do. That mission remains. People across this country rightly want stability. That's why we acted to support businesses and households with their energy costs this winter. It's also the case that global economic conditions are worsening due to the continuation of petins of Pauling War in Ukraine. But it is clear that parts of our mini budget went further and faster than markets were expecting. So the way we are delivering our mission right now has to change. We need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline. I have therefore decided to keep the increase in corporation tax that was planned by the previous government. This will raise £18 billion per year. It will act as a down payment on our full medium term fiscal plan, which will be accompanied by a forecast from the independent OBR. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure debt is falling as a share of the economy in the medium term. We will control the size of the state to ensure that taxpayers' money is always well spent. Our public sector will become more efficient to deliver world-class services for the British people, and spending will grow less rapidly than previously planned. I met the former chancellor earlier today.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2815,2022-10-14 13:37:25

I'm absolutely determined to see through what I have promised, to deliver a higher growth, more prosperous, united kingdom, to see us through the storm we face. We've already delivered the energy price guarantee, making sure people aren't facing huge bills this winter. But it was right in the face of the issues that we had that I acted decisively to ensure that we have economic stability, because that is vitally important to people and businesses right across our country. Harry Cole, thank you for having me, Harry, and your son, you are the one that wanted to cut the 45p rate. You stood on a platform to win the leadership of the Conservative Party on a platform to cut corporation tax. You and the Chancellor, the Ex-Chancellor, designed this budget together in lockstep, we're told. It times in secret the two of you. He has to go because of the fallout for it. How come you get to stay? My priority is making sure we deliver the economic stability that our country needs. That's why I had to take the difficult decisions I've taken today. The mission remains the same. We do need to raise our country's economic growth levels. We do need to deliver for people across the country. We're committed to delivering on the energy price guarantee, which people are already seeing in their bills. But ultimately, we also need to make sure that we have economic stability, and I have to act in the national interest as Prime Minister. Chris Mason, can you see? Excuse the Bundesprimingister, but given everything that has happened, what credibility do you have to continue, Government? What I have done today is made sure that we have economic stability in this country. Jeremy Hunt has Chancellor, is somebody who shares my desire for a high growth low tax economy. But we reckon that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2817,2022-10-14 13:46:52
14591," Over the place in the last week, we've had loads of 103.50 just a couple of weeks ago. We were through 112 early this morning through 113, even guy and police that Lizzie turned to policy. So let's sit there on policy. There was a reversal in there. It was the plan freeze on corporation tax, a reversal on that. They were going to try and hike that may be a couple of months ago. Now we've got the backtrack. Guy, can you tell me if we're going to see a reversal on any other initiatives whatsoever because I just see one. The reversal on a planned freeze on the corporation tax. Where's the rest of it? So if you're looking at balancing the budgets, corporation tax is one element of it. The N.I. cut as well, the national insurance cut, it is obviously a huge other element to it. The top rate of tax was from a fiscal point of view, largely irrelevant. It was a political blunder that they decided to get rid of that. So whether this goes far enough, we will, we'll, we'll wait and watch. But it, but if that is, then this doesn't feel like a sort of wholesale reversal, as you say, of, as what Lizzie was saying, of what was originally announced. Does this go far enough? I think the market, I think you're right. The market is going to take a little while to judge what is happening here. And I think we need to hear from Jeremy Hunts. I don't know where Jeremy is, but we'll hopefully hear from him soon. I think he was sorting out Farnham Lane rather than sorting out the entire country. So I think we're in a position here where we need to hear from Jeremy Hunts. He was against, so what is interesting is that Jeremy Hunts was against raising corporation tax. He was in the camp, when he was campaigning for the job of saying that actually what we need to do is cut corporation tax and raise other taxes. We've ended up with almost the exact reverse of that. So it's going to be interesting to see how he kind of manages that process. So I think at this point we need to wait. We've only, we've got the, the second of the Chancellor, we've got, trust coming out with a pretty unconvincing statements. I think we need to hear on the 31st or maybe earlier from Jeremy Hunts to get a full idea. I don't think they've got a fully thought out plan, John. I think that, I said this earlier on in the day. I agree. This is not a fully formed plan at this point. They are making policy on the who they decided on corporation tax, but that's about it at this point. They have not got a fully thought out plan that they think will work a for the markets and b for the party. So let's go there and I know this is tough to answer, but the incoming Chancellor Jeremy Hunts, we understand he's going to deliver the medium term fiscal plan at the end of the month. This guy said October 31, are we going to hear the budget that he would have delivered for say, soonak or is this just a mix of both? I think guys write to characterize Jeremy Hunts somewhere between trusts and soonak, and that's precisely why we're expecting she's picked him to try and reach out to those other parts of the party. In his bid for leader, he said that cutting business taxes won't stoke inflation, tackling inflation has to be the main challenge. So you can see where he sits there, but we don't know what he's going to be like as Chancellor really yet. If he's serving under trust, he's going to have to, in a way, show that he is still delivering that vision. You heard in the press conference the telegraph was asking almost disappointedly if you're going to make reversals, how do you still get to stay as prime minister? So there's this big wing of the Tory party that does actually want to see, the membership that voted for trust wants to see her carrying out her tax cutting vision. I've got to take a step back here, guys, well, and talk about what's happened with market, something that may not have happened in the QE era. We've seen markets push back. Mohamed El-Eryn was on the show with us earlier this week. He wrote it in a Bloomberg opinion column. The vigilantes are back. Guys, you think we're going to see more of this? Absolutely. I think the whole problem here was that we were in an environment where the market was clearly concerned about inflation. And that was blindingly obvious to put a policy into, and I think that politicians globally are now going to be aware of this, that they need to tread carefully. We are now back in the era where, if you want to be reincarnated as being all powerful, you come back as the bond market. Because clearly, we are now seeing that that is where the power now lies. The UK has been the first example of this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2818,2022-10-14 13:51:50
14592," as being all powerful, you come back as the bond market. Because clearly we are now seeing that that is where the power now lies. The UK has been the first kind of example of this. There will almost certainly be others. I imagine the Maloney government in Italy is treading much more cautiously as a result of what is happening here. Other governments will be paying attention as well. Markets can move... Before we were moving markets... bond markets are moving in very small increments. There was very low volatility. But as we've now seen, you can get huge volatility or events that can erupt very, very quickly. Makes me think, guys, just how much fiscal space we have to deal with issues going forward from here. One question that I've pondered and guy know you've done the same thing over the last few weeks. What more surprised me was surprised me more rather is not the announcement by the British government. Just the way this market responded to £45billion worth of tax cuts. Now, guy, you said it. Your words. These were fee-brow markets. The timing was not great. But, guys, I do wonder. We've got a big initiative coming out of Europe to try and offset some of the energy pain. We've still got a big initiative coming out of the UK as well. And these central banks, guys, you know are still very, very keen on tightening up policy. They are. But... And I think this is going to be the challenge for Bank of England almost the Monday morning. How do you manage this when you have, as we've discussed, fee-brow markets... You've got markets that are super sensitive. Is Qt going to be a policy that ultimately will have to be withdrawn in this kind of environment? Can you manage... We're drawing the balance sheet, reducing the balance sheet in this kind of environment? Can you raise rates as aggressively? I think duration really matters here, John. I think it's over what period of time. And I think that's something that we've all got to try and figure out. How quickly do we want inflation to come back to targets? How quickly can we get inflation back down to target? 2%, circa 2%. And is the time period in which that needs to be managed longer than we originally conceived that it might be? Maybe you can do all of this, but maybe it will just take longer than you originally thought. We're seeing an awful lot of aggressive front loading at the moment. We're back to the kind of 1980s, certainly with the Fed policy that we're seeing. And others as well. Is that time frame simply too aggressive? Yeah. After the years and years, a very, very low interest rate. So, guys, there's two points you're making here. One is what is the appropriate time horizon to return inflation back towards targets. Jean-Pas van de Blancrock has written about that in the last few weeks. But I think the more important point here is what is the nature of the shock guy? Is it a one-off shock, one winter, one war, inflation, absolutely ripping? And then we go back to where we were before, perhaps in 12 months time? Or is this a secular shift to higher rates higher inflation? And are we seeing a structural, a permanent structural adjustment away from, say, sources of Russian energy? Now, guy, if it is the latter, then you have to wonder how sustainable some of these policy efforts are coming from these governments right now. I think there is a... I've heard you talking about this throughout the day. There is a large argument that says that we are going into a new paradigm, that we are not going to simply return to the low volatility environment we had before that effectively was suppressed by central banks. I think that's going to be incredibly difficult to achieve. There are lots of structural forces, I think, on the move at the moment, John. You've got de-globalization, you've got the energy story, you've got an energy story that's going to take longer to sort out, maybe than a lot of people think at this point. Moving to a lower carbon energy sort of plan is going to take maybe decades. It's certainly not going to be achieved overnight, where we're changing our policy with regards to China, and it's interesting to see whether the UK sits in all of this. So all of this is incredibly structurally you were thought inflationary. So it's going to be much more difficult for central banks to operate with that very low environment, low-rate environment. I don't think we're going back there. I think the environment looks to be very different going forward. And I think it's just one source of change that we're seeing here at the moment. There are multiple points of change, and I think that's going to make it very difficult for markets to navigate this, and to fully understand ultimately what that means for policy. I think policy makers are still trying to figure this out as well. I don't think they've got a rulebook or an understanding of ultimately how they are going to respond. So again, we're going to see volatility and policy as a result. I think we're all struggling with this one.

You heard it asked in the news conference, Lizzie, she's got to come up with a better answer for this. Why is getting rid of the chancellor in the national interest but stepping down is not? Yeah, and what I heard from what she just said was that it's exactly the same vision. But it needs to be made palatable to markets to get it through. And that is why she's had to suck the chancellor. And there was more of an appeal to markets there. And it needs to reassure markets. But I wouldn't do whether markets will still want to be on board with the overall vision for Trersonomics because at the heart of it, even though she's saying that she's now going to raise cooperation tax, it's still Trersonomics. And it's stunning that she is going to raise cooperation tax because just reading from something she said at Prime Minister's questions only on Wednesday, I feel it would be wrong in a time when we're trying to attract investment into our country and a time of global economics load-on to be raising taxes. So this is really undermining to herself, have to wonder where the markets will buy it. And even if there was a little rally when we heard that Quartin was going to be replaced when there was going to be this new turn on cooperation tax, fundamentally, the economic credibility has been undermined. The BOE's had to step in. So is it too little too late? Well, I can tell you, Sterling rolling over here at 111.96.

Where this leaves, Governor Bailey, Monday morning, after this Gilmark operation ends today. Well, I think Andrew Bailey's got to be creative here. I was speaking to a former B.O.E. policy maker, Martin Wheel, about what he could possibly do. He suggested targeted support for pension funds that need the help. But Andrew Bailey needs to get out of this situation where he's beholden to fiscal policy and prioritising financial stability over inflation fighting. He knows that. The IMF's told him that, I think, if the market volatility continues on Monday, he'll be looking for something other than the blunt tool of QA. Hey, Lizzie. Fantastic words today. Lizzie Bird and Guy Johnson. Guy, I know you're picking things up in about seven minutes time. Looking forward to that. Guy Johnson there and Lizzie Bird. Johnson, the co-acting is out.

14595," Pepsi's number fever campaign in the Philippines has probably gone down in history as one of the biggest marketing disasters in history, mainly because of a human error that led Pepsi to print more winning caps than they planned. The resulting chaos caused riots, civil unrest, and even deaths. Reporting this story took over a year and it resulted in me flying to Manila in the Philippines to meet unlucky winners and to find out exactly what happened back then in the 1990s. My name is Jeff Mesh, I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country, it's made up of thousands of islands and it's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. American culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines, they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music, for example. They love all things America and that extends to their love for soft drinks, Pepsi Cola, Coca Cola. In the 1990s it was everywhere. Pepsi and Coca Cola were embroiled in what is now known as the Cola Wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion, it had been rolled out in America to great success. And so Pepsi decided to roll it out internationally, particularly in Asia. They thought it was the answer to their problems, they thought it could finally help them beat their biggest competitor. In the name of one, I won! Look for the winning number in size, I first ever gave up on TV, the million newspapers, you could be a millionaire. A million pesos or $6,000,000 doesn't sound like a lot now, but in 1992 that was a phenomenal amount of money. You've got to remember that in the Philippines at the time the average monthly income was about $100. A million pesos was wealth beyond anyone's wildest imaginations. Number fever caught fire in the Philippines. Kids were saving up their pocket money to buy a bottle of Pepsi. Parents were squirreling away all of the bottle caps in bags. You would walk down the street and people were going through trash trying to find discarded bottle caps. It was a national phenomenon. Pepsi boasted that half the population of the Philippines was playing it. Number fever boosted Pepsi's sales every month from $10 million to $14 million. It had a huge impact on Pepsi's bottom line. Number fever quickly became number hysteria. Mades were being jailed for stealing their employer's winning bottle caps. There were even some murders over winning bottle caps. People were fighting in the streets over these caps. There were signs that there were going to be problems with number fever very early. Pepsi had rolled out the competition in Chile and a garbled fax had caused some kind of problem with the winning number. They'd announced the wrong one in Chile causing riots. There were signs that there could be big problems ahead if they didn't keep their eye on the ball. So in 1992 Pepsi decided to extend the campaign in the Philippines and they announced that the competition would go on for a few more weeks. One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. Three, four, nine. The problem was three, four, nine had already been allocated as a non-winning number in earlier campaigns. So there were literally hundreds of thousands of bottle caps with three, four, nine just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands were finding...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2821,2022-10-14 14:05:51
14596," caps with 349 just floating around the Philippines. Hundreds of thousands of people all across the Philippines, thousands of islands, were finding winning bottle caps. 349, 349. Some people had 10 lucky 349 bottle caps. People were dancing in the street, celebrating. They thought their problems were over. They were millionaires. It's still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps. But we know that Pepsi printed over 600,000 of them. Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem. Hundreds of people started arriving at their bottling plants with their lucky bottle caps. They realized something was seriously wrong. Pepsi tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plant. But it wasn't enough. People didn't want just a handful of pesos. People wanted their million pesos prize. Within a year, violent protests and riots outside Pepsi factories would leave dozens injured and five people dead. At one Pepsi factory in the Philippines, a grenade was thrown through the window. It killed three Pepsi employees. Anacita Rosario was a schoolteacher living near Manila in the Philippines. She was one of the tragic victims of this whole thing. She was walking to a nearby store to buy some rice one day when a monitor of cocktails was thrown at a Pepsi truck in a violent protest. It bounced under the truck and exploded. It killed her and an innocent bystander who was just a child and injured many others. When I was in the Philippines, I tracked down Anacita's daughter Cindy and her husband, Role. It was clear to me that they were still very upset by the whole thing. You know, a family had been ripped apart by this competition. Role told me that he'd never remarried. He'd told me that he'd gone to meet Pepsi executives after his wife was killed. He was angry. He said to them, you know, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for number fever. The biggest revelation from my reporting was rumors that Pepsi was somehow involved in bombing their own trucks. I found a newspaper report with a headline that said, Pepsi goons bomb their own trucks. When I visited the MBI, the police department in the Philippines, they presented me with documents and interviews with people who claimed that Pepsi had paid them to cause riots and to cause trouble outside their plants in order to destabilise the situation and to frame the owners of the coalitions that were fighting them to try and curry favour. I just thought that was so shocking and of course Pepsi denied it, but help us out that a company would be accused of bombing their own trucks. The contest had sparked so much anger in the Philippines because it landed at just this really weird time in the Philippines history. It was during a crazy election that was racked with allegations of fraud. The Philippines was in a kind of love-hate relationship with America. They loved obviously the American aid and finances that was pouring into the country, but at the same time they yearned for independence. They wanted to be their own country. Vicente Del Fiero was a local preacher living in Manila and he hated the number fever campaign. Del Fiero thought Pepsi's number fever campaign was just one of the many ways that America was asserting its dominance over a third world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted to-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2822,2022-10-14 14:10:10
14597, world country. He hated seeing his fellow countrymen get ripped off in his eyes by this huge multinational American company. He wanted justice. Delphiero rounded up over 800 winners of 349 bottle caps and he got them all together to sue Pepsi for over 400 million dollars to be divided between those holders of lucky bottle caps. Delphiero took money from some of the people who could afford it. They paid in 500 pesos to help with legal fees but for people who couldn't afford the money he would just represent them pro bono. He flew to America and he hired two consumer lawyers here in America to take on Pepsi. He had a meeting at Pepsi's headquarters to try and resolve the problem but he said he wanted to take it all the way to the highest courts in America. When those cases were heard in America those courts decided that this was a problem that should be heard in the Philippines not in America. Back in the Philippines Delphiero continued his case in the Filipino courts. At one stage there were arrest warrants handed out for nine Pepsi-Cola executives which he saw as a big victory. We don't know if those arrest warrants were ever upheld but it made newspaper headlines across the country. Pepsi did not take kindly to Delphiero's campaign. They tried everything to shut him down. They sued him for libel. My father had to attend three times a month for a branch one for the fight and another heating for the branch one thirteen eight also three times a month. Also there was a time my father's was hospital. Jeweldo heart failure still had to attend the two branch heating of otherwise for not attending the judge will issue water to my father. My father passed away on what it was in 2013 then after staying for almost one year in the hospital he died of complications with the heart failure. After the death of my father I was inspired to do the website. Pepsi could be remembered for what they did to the consumer in the Philippines and to my father. When I reached out to Pepsi for comment for this story they claimed that they didn't have access to anyone who was working at Pepsi that was around in those days. They also said that during COVID-19 they didn't have access to their their documents about this but you know they were very they were very careful to say that they were sorry for everything that happened and we do know that Pepsi did try everything to try and make this right. The Pepsi number fever disaster cost the company millions we know that they paid up to ten million dollars in those goodwill payments but the financial effect could be much greater after the disaster we know that Pepsi sales dipped they were overtaken by Coca-Cola again. Pepsi's number fever disaster changed the legacy of that soft drink in the Philippines forever. Some people of certain age won't touch it. For many people Pepsi is a taboo word. A lot of the people that I spoke to were still quite traumatized by their experience by that experience of winning a million pesos losing it and then returning to their normal life in poverty in Manila.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2823,2022-10-14 14:14:26
14598," When the news of the bombing came out, it was a massive story in Germany. We are following some breaking news coming to us out of Dortmund in Germany. It was covered by all the media outlets. Three roadside explosions triggered at the same time last night as the coach left its hotel in the south of Dortmund. We should not let them affect our life, whatever it was. The media echoed far beyond Dortmund. I think it was front page news and every single big paper around Europe. Everyone thought of like a terrorist attack and people were scared that throughout the city and Dortmund there was more attacks to be happening. Unbeknownst to investigators just after the bomb went off and the players of the team were shell shocked. In the hotel, eating steak and sweet potatoes. My name is Thomas Rogers. I'm the journalist who wrote the article, The Get Rich Quick Scheme, that nearly killed a German soccer team. Dortmund is a mid-sized city in the western part of Germany in a state called North Rhein-Westphalia. It's a former industrial city that's kind of fallen on hard times in the last few decades. It was severely bombed in the war. So the center of the city is quite stark. Some of the few high points include its soccer team. My name is Aikening. I'm a reporter with Bloomberg News and I'm a great fan of Borussia Dortmund. Dortmund fans are super loyal. On all match days, the entire city isn't black and yellow. It's like a religion. I think more than most German cities, soccer does play a very large role in the identity of Dortmund. In October of 2000, the BBB became the first team in the Bundesliga to actually go public. Salaries for soccer players in the Bundesliga have gone up very dramatically. With such high prices, they thought that by going public, they would be able to compete better with big teams like Bayern Munich. Unfortunately, that didn't go too well. Dortmund bought too many expensive players, high wages, and the club almost went bust in 2005. The price of their shares has sometimes gone up, but mostly gone down since they made that decision. So on April 11, 2017, the team was staying in a hotel on the outskirts of Dortmund. Match days are always special in Dortmund. Everyone is looking forward to it. The team always meets in the same hotel ahead of matches. They stayed in this hotel in order to have a kind of neutral space before game so that they could concentrate, be isolated from distractions, things like that. Everyone was pretty optimistic there to chance to go really far, maybe into the finals. I was in the office and getting ready for match day. I was going to meet with a friend, a fellow Dortmund supporter in a pub. Es always, the fans are very excited about matches. That day, they were heading to play in the quarter-final against AS Monaco at Signal Idunas Stadium, which is in the center of Dortmund. Shortly before 7pm, the players of the team boarded their official team bus. When the bus took off, the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street. There were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2824,2022-10-14 14:19:02
14599," When the bus took off the parking lot of the hotel and turned on the street, there were three detonations, three bombs that exploded and hit the bus off Dortmund. Three explosions occurred close to the Borussia Dortmund team bus. The B team bus had just left the hotel. The explosions destroyed two windows in the rear part of the bus. People screamed, people jumped to the ground. The fellow Dortmund fan I was supposed to watch the match with, he called me and said, turn on the TV, there was an attack on the Dortmund bus and I thought he was like, there was impossible. Some of the players screamed at the driver to keep driving as fast as possible because they were worried that people might storm the bus. German investigators say the explosive devices used in the attack on the Borussia Dortmund bus contained metal, pins and the one had pierced a seat headrest. Unbeknownst to the team members, the actual mastermind behind the attack was as they were disembarking the bus, was actually eating steak and sweet potatoes at the hotel, they had just left. Authorities are attempting to verify a letter left at the scene claiming Jihadists were behind the attack. Because there had been a series of attacks by Islamic terrorists in Germany and Europe, there was a widespread suspicion in the media that this was another Islamic terror attack. Three letters were found at the site of the bombing that took credit for the attack on behalf of Islamic State. There were however reasons to doubt this particular narrative. Would actually be a surprise if ISIS were actually part of this attack. Possibly could be employed by other groups like the Far Right wing to try and shift the blame. The letters had some strange qualities. They were written in a strange German that used big sophisticated words but had basic grammar mistakes as if someone was native German speaker but pretending to be a foreign person. Federal investigators have detained one man suspected of links to Islamist terrorism, one of two suspects whose apartments were raided this morning. Shortly after the bombing, a man in Austria named Rudolf, who was a big BBB fan, he noticed that something strange was going on on the stock market related to the team's shares. He emailed the lawyers of BBB who then forwarded that email on to investigators. The email stated that someone had bought 60,000 BBB put options, a wager that the value of the shares of the team would fall below a certain amount at a certain date. Why would someone buy that ahead of a match and then three bombs go off? Something isn't right here. For the person to make money off of that, it required the stock to go down quite a bit in a fairly short period of time and it wouldn't just be the team losing a match, it would require something much bigger than that. There was another big red flag about this purchase, which is the fact that it had actually been made. Number one on the day of the bombing but also from an IP address that had been traced to the actual hotel where the bombing had taken place. When three explosions targeted the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund for ballers on April 11th, written notes left at the scene claimed the attack was the work of ISIL. The truth, as is now alleged, is remarkable. On April 21st, the police arrested a man in a southern German city called Tsubingan. It was on his way to work and his name was Sergei Bina-Gaude. He seemed like an unlikely suspect because he had no known connections to the Islamic terror world. He didn't seem like a far-right extremist, he didn't seem like a left-wing extremist either. He seemed to be a completely unremarkable young man. A 28-year-old German Russian man named only a Sergei W stayed in the same hotel as the players on the night before the bombing. He specifically requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2825,2022-10-14 14:23:20
14600," He requested an upper room overlooking the bushes where the explosive devices were hidden. The media dissected why he would do that, what was his past. He had been inspired by the 2015 terror attack in Paris. And he noticed that in the aftermath of the attack, the stocks of French companies went down. And he believed that if an attack took place that was directed at a specific company, that the decrease in stock price for that company would be even more dramatic. It never occurred to anyone that someone would do that out of greed. We now know that the suspect bought three different derivatives on the Borzi Adortman shares, with all these derivatives he bet on falling shares. The suspect bought the majority of these financial products on the 11th of April, the day of the attack. If the plot had been complete, successful, and the stock had reached a value of zero, intergold would have made up to 570,000 euros, or the equivalent of about $608,000. Ultimately, the plan completely backfired. The attacker, Sega, Ben and Gold didn't make any money, in fact, he lost money. In court, he would be extremely quiet. He usually kept his hands clasped together. One of the lawyers actually commented that he had never seen a defendant act so calmly. Viener Gold had served some time in the German military. From that information and from online research, he was able to figure out how to assemble remote, detonated bombs that would do what he hoped to do. There were a few days of extremely emotional testimony, including the soccer players who described stouting whether or not they could ever play another game again. It brought everything back up, and it didn't quite help them to kind of process what was going on. Throughout it all, he sat there completely silent. The big mystery that was swirling around the trial was the question of why he may have simply done it because he wanted to impress a woman. Rebecca is a young woman who has a very troubled home life. She ultimately sees her relationship with Viener Gold as an opportunity to leave that troubled home. Viener Gold is a Russian immigrant to Germany. He speaks with an accent. He has anxiety in large groups of Germans. She begins to resent the fact that he has these fears and feels a little bit trapped. Rebecca attempts to dump him on multiple occasions and he threatens to commit suicide if she leaves him. Viener Gold apparently told Rebecca that she would soon be seeing a surprise. After being dumped via text message, he apparently began planning for the Sittac in earnest. Viener Gold was charged with 28 counts of attempted murder, which carried a maximum sentence in Germany of life in prison. He claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack, but as time went on, he admitted that he had actually been the person who had built the explosives and had set them off. But he claimed that he didn't want to actually kill anybody. Ultimately, Viener Gold didn't receive the harshest possible sentence. He was given 14 years in prison, but it's still a considerable amount in jail in Germany.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2826,2022-10-14 14:27:41
14601," The threats of an asteroid hitting Earth is very real. If it's big enough, it's also very final. These are very, very infrequent events. The probability is not zero though. A blinding flash of light streaking across the sky. About a hundred tons of space rock falls on Earth every day. Most of it is so small it burns up in our atmosphere, or lands unnoticed away from major populations. No human in the past thousand years is known to have been killed by a meteorite. On according to NASA, no large object is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred years. However, one thing is certain, we haven't found them all. There are thousands out there and we don't know where they are. There are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in billions. Scientists all over the world are working toward detecting and deflecting the most catastrophic of natural disasters. The race is on to find as many of these objects as we can. Yes, a way of calculating whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not. I mean, I think it's something worth investing in. Sorry, existence that's safe, right? Amy, let's get this one out of the way. It's probably the question you get asked the most, but how scared should we be? Asteroids and comets are a natural hazard that's out there like a lot of other natural hazards. These are very, very infrequent events. These collision events where an object actually impacts the Earth. The most important thing that we need to know about asteroids is when the next impact is going to happen and how bad it will be. What we know is that an object that's about, say, a kilometer across is capable of causing very, very wide devastation across the planet, really, truly global devastation. The object that wiped out the dinosaurs was somewhere in the neighborhood of five to ten kilometers across, so even bigger than that. At a kilometer, it's still going to be very bad and will have global effects. For objects that are capable of causing what I would call sort of regional damage, kind of a large major metropolitan area, a city in its surrounding environments, sort of around a hundred-ish meters. It depends on the details of the proposition and so forth. By the 1980s, NASA was cataloging near-earth objects. In 1994, stargazers watched as comet shoemaker levy-9 hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the earth, and the event became a turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998, Congress tasked NASA with finding 90% of asteroids and comets, one kilometer wide, or larger. Soon after, Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and Deep Impact brought attention and fear to the masses. The great news is that the vast majority, more than 90% of all the really large one kilometer near-earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are still quite capable of causing a lot of damage, but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter, they're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter in what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the asteroids in the inner part of our solar system live, and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population, though, that kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near-earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near-earth objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we re-.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2827,2022-10-14 14:32:38
14602," millions of near-athabjects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 20, 25,000, something like that. When we first spot an object, we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across the sky. So all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about its true size. Is it large or is it small? So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled in determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. NASA runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take, which is useful for time consuming. A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not the objects is danger or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroid, it may take days of computing time on very big machines to determine this hazardousness. The current problem is that there's as many asteroids out there to spend a huge amount of computational power on all of them. So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and pose a hazard to Earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data. By training the network in this way, you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planet. And once it's trained, you can apply this network to all the unknown asteroids. And then you can make a selection and say, hey, these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planet. It doesn't mean that they do, but it only means that they look very similar to the ones we know they do. What else did you find? Should we be particularly concerned about anything? One thing that we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the greater than forward in time, they came quite close to Earth. We find a handful which were not detected before or not considered being dangerous before and we think they are potentially dangerous. It's very hard to simulate kind of going forward in time and asteroid that's going to hit Earth because what the Earth is really small and what space is really big. And then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly Earth. And then Cmon had the ingenious idea of not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from Earth's surface and integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. You need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what NASA is doing. NASA is taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all forwards in time, calculating their orbits, and then see what fraction sort of gets close to Earth. Not even hitting Earth but getting close to Earth. That they call it a potential impactor. So you calculate the solar system forwards in time for let's say a thousand years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forward in time would fall on the surface, you calculate them backwards due today and then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known impactors and compare with all the other asteroids in the solar system. Consimulations and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely, since the observations get more complex, the physics gets more complex and if the physics gets more complex the mathematics becomes more complex and at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore and then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this trained neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a second whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous and therefore deserves more attention or more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2828,2022-10-14 14:36:24
14603," training neural network, we have a way of calculating in a fraction of a second whether or not an asteroid is potentially dangerous or not and therefore deserves more attention or more time to spend on for for redefining our capabilities dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids, time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter. We'd really like to find them on their decades away because the more time you have, the more options you have and the less energy it takes to move an object aside. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid until recently pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last reason already in my opinion, yes. We have lots of options available you can just simply bump into the object and just nudge it out of the way. That's one possibility and that's kind of in a way the sort of the simplest thing to think about just nudging it off its path a little bit with a massive object, a spacecraft, so it's kind of like bowling if you have a long time or a long stretch of runway in the lane. Just a very small twist on the bowling ball will make a big change in where it ultimately ends up. Another option would be something where you take a very big big massive spacecraft and you park it next to the object and you use the force of gravity as a towing rig that takes longer though and you need to be able to send a pretty massive spacecraft and obviously depends a lot on how big the asteroid is. Other options start to get more and more complicated and they range from painting one side of the object of white color and painting the other side dark and then letting a pressure of lights or perturbates orbit. In a departure from the lab and computer simulations NASA has real plans to rehearse kinetic impact deflection. In 2021 the agency will launch DART, the double asteroid redirection test mission which will intercept a 160 meter asteroid in 2022. Better to practice now before we have to deal with an actual threat. In the meantime discovering asteroids are best bet. Thousands of scientists and amateur astronomers around the world make up an informal network that surveyed the heavens. But that may not be enough. NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our network of sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our network of international observers so that we can get follow up because we find these objects when they're distributed all over the late sky. Once we get more observations we get better data we can make better predictions. If you look at the big impactors we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years with 50 years most of them we haven't seen coming so the danger the real danger I think comes from the objects we don't know about and notes from the objects we do know about. This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters and climate change is a problem with the global commons so the thing that we risk collectively is that it sort of then becomes nobody's problem and nobody takes ownership of the asteroids are all over the sky they just truly cross boundaries and borders with the seconds notice. Kind of imagine in the future maybe he wants a small satellites around the earth that are always going and looking out for I mean I think it's something worth investing in it's our existence as stake right",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2829,2022-10-14 14:40:37
14604," The pandemic has affected everyone in different ways. Some pass the time by baking. Homemade sourdough bread. Do I need to say more? Some chose to binge watch Netflix. I'm going to put my glasses in. But for millions of others, they wanted to uproot the financial industry. Here's your stock that can change your life. I see a stock going up and I buy it and I just watch it until it stops going up and then I sell it. I haven't gained over $3 million. I want some free money. I don't think you can overstate the online communities of social media influence on financial markets. A large group of inexperienced investors who discuss their plans on social media platform Reddit have shaken up the stock market in a big way. The stock that everybody's talking about right now is GameStop. Video game retailing GameStop has set to continue their head spinning ascent today. The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street's ass. The more these stocks go up, the more the big guys are getting creamed and losing billions of dollars. This is in a wealthy person's game anymore. Anyone can play it. I took up a little bit of a new hobby and I'm interested in day trading. As an investor nowadays, you don't have to look a specific way. You don't have to wear specific clothes. You don't have to be doing it from a trading floor on Wall Street in like a high-rise building in downtown Manhattan. The narrative of what's driving the markets is no longer being held in secret offices in New York and Boston of privileged people talking to other privileged people. It's right out in the open. It's on Twitter. It's on Reddit. From brokerage apps to discord channels and subreddits to TikTok influencers. One of the last holdouts in the world of disruption. Finance is next in line. Investing should be as you pick with us as shopping online. That's Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood, the online brokerage app. Talking about how he wants his app to disrupt the world of stock trading like Amazon disrupted the world of home shopping. And I think that speaks to exactly the mission that a platform like Robinhood has, which is to democratize investing. Robinhood was started in 2013 by Vlad Tenev and by Jubat in where else Silicon Valley. As an alternative to the big brokerages, but with one big difference. As they were building the social network around finances for people, they realized that there was a gap in the market and that free trading could become something that they could bring to the markets. They could disrupt the industry. While no fee trading is industry standard today, it was unheard of when it was first introduced. The online brokerage industry was really innovative when they came on the scene 10, 15 years ago. But they kind of stopped innovating where you haven't seen those commissions come down beyond five or six or seven dollars. Robinhood, think that by offering zero commission that they're going to push people onto this platform. And on top of no fee trading, the customer's Robinhood was courting, had been long overlooked in the world of finance. So the typical customer of a Charles Schwab, for example, is putting a lot more money in that brokerage account than the typical customer at Robinhood. And today, with all of its popularity, the median account size is about $240. There's fiddalities in the Schwab, the e-trades of the world. They look down their nose at those kind of accounts. I don't want a thousand dollar account. They're just a headache. I want a hundred thousand dollar account. This is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood that's different than every other single brokerage platform is how easy it is to use.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2830,2022-10-14 14:45:00
14605," And this is key here, right? Because the thing about Robinhood, that's different than every other single brokerage platform, is how easy it is to use. The design of the Robinhood app really has in mind a user who might be coming at this absolutely cold. The fonts are very well-sized. The shapes, the colors. All of that is something that the founders of Robinhood paid really close attention to. And by creating an interface that catered to a newer investor, they were able to gather a pretty healthy group of customers. And by 2019, they had about 10 million customers. Those 10 million customers were a huge success story for Robinhood. But no one could have predicted its explosion after the arrival of COVID-19. Remain indoors to the greatest extent, and 100% of the non-essential workforce must stay home. What we saw when the pandemic hit was the growth of Robinhood users absolutely turbocharged. And oddly, you saw this surge in interest in stock trading. Then they saw the absolute surge in 2020 in customer growth. And now, by many accounts, they have more than 20 million customers, which is pretty extraordinary. So the next step for them is to figure out how to monetize those users and how even with their small account sizes to get them to grow with the company. And as it releases more products, come along with them. and you Robyn Hood would become one of the COVID economies' breakout successes. Robyn Hood traders, as they're called, became the shorthand explanation for the frenzy of often speculative retail investing after the pandemic lockdowns. Kids wake up in the morning, they go on Robyn Hood. They're, you know, in the shower, they check Robyn Hood. Kids are learning how the stock market works at 18, while they're at school, you know, checking their phones and between classes, because notifications pop up telling them what their stocks are doing that day. With these new tools, millennials and Gen Z are investing in the market and ways their parents could have never even dreamt of. That is sort of key when we talk about the divide between older and younger generations is that the younger generation is exposed to so much more information and tools at their disposal to do what they want in the market. The older generations, you never had the technology or the cost structure that you could play the markets like you can today. So you were stuck with giving your money to a professional investor and paying them a fee to do it. When I speak to young kids, they tell me, I'm making mistakes, I'm losing money, I'm not a perfect investor, but I'm 18 and by the time I'm 30, which will be, you know, 10 years from now, I'm going to have been erected within markets for a decade. And so it's a learning experience more so than anything else. And you can look at it and you can say, wow, that's, you know, that's risk taking that's done. But, you know, if you could possibly shave 10, 20 years off your working life versus adding five years, I don't think you can fault people for that. But, Robinhood is only part of the puzzle. Sure you can trade on it, but without research, information and data, you're just blindly throwing darts at different stocks and hoping to strike it rich. Wall Street forever has always run on what we now call narratives or needs. You know, people telling rumors to each other, they've been around for a hundred years. On Wall Street, information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you did it. And the people who had it had a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2831,2022-10-14 14:49:31
14606," for 100 years. On Wall Street information is its own currency. Historically, either you had it or you didn't, and the people who had it had a huge advantage. In the past, those narratives and means didn't have a network effect. It would be one person telling another person over the phone. In fact, when I broke into this business in the 80s, a lot of people used to complain that they weren't on the call list to get those ideas. Social media changed all of that. It's passed forward to 2021. That's being done on the internet now, and that's being done on Discord and Twitter and Stocktwits and Reddit. And the impact is very similar, but orders and orders is meant to too large. As social media has played a bigger part in our lives, it's also played a bigger and kind of more important role in how people find investing ideas online and on these platforms. How do those ideas spread on TikTok? Yes, that TikTok. People aren't just going to it for C-Shanty videos. The personal finance hashtag on TikTok has garnered 3.5 billion views from its 1 billion monthly active users. By comparison, videos found under the cooking and health tips hashtag have 2.6 and 2.1 billion views respectively. The trajectory of Robinhood and TikTok were literally on par. What happened in the stock market this week? So the word of the week is expectations. Absolutely essential that you understand the risks of shorting. And Kayla Kilbrot and Kyla Scanlon are two of those financial influencer TikTokers, also known as Finn Fluentzers. I think people still care about fashion, they care about culture, but it's also like there's this big behemoth thing called the stock market that we really don't know a whole lot about and it's a gig kept behind the industry. And so people like want to unpack that. And so my audience is a lot of them are younger investors who are looking to hone their skills. Tech in right up. Kyla and Kayla are two of the more let's say professional TikTok influencers. The Tesla Arc Bitcoin Biotech Risk Cluster. I have been trading since high school and it was a really interesting way for me to fill out my decision making frameworks and to think about thinking. And I think that the more that we can have people thinking about finance, the better that we're going to progress as a society, I think it's a huge gap in our educational system. If you're going to buy an option for a stock, you think it's going to go up. It's a call. So think of it like this. I made the options video where I was like options are just like shopping. Rumor has it that this pal is about to go up in price. So if I come in tomorrow, can I still buy it at said price? And a ton of women just like attacked that video and we're like, you explain things so much better than my boyfriend or my professor or like I could sit and listen to you all day. And I was like, this is what I was looking for. But TikTok's algorithm does not reward common measured videos about responsible investing. It rewards this. Watch this video for 30 seconds and you'll be rich for the rest of your life. I try not to say the A word, the ALGO word because TikTok listens to us. The algorithm does impact how you feel. You know, you do notice which videos do better versus which videos do worse. How do you catch some attention in less than 60 seconds? And how do you make it something that they're like, I need this in my life? Nearly impossible to do that in 60 seconds. But the people who perfect it are the people that you're going to watch and get to stick around. And where people are sticking around, read it. And it's nearly countless subreddits about finance. And by far the biggest one of those is Wall Street Bets. There's a lot of social media platforms out there, but Reddit is like the social media platform for finance. Places like Wall Street Bets is where it all goes down. Started in January 2012, it wasn't long before Wall Street Bets adopted a 4chan-like etiquette, leading to their tagline, like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal. We had all these unexplained stock news and we would be grasping for a wide stock XYZ junk 20% in a day. And you would look at Wall Street Bets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of squared the circle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2832,2022-10-14 14:53:49
14607," He jumped 20% in a day and he would look at Wall Street vets and you would see people there talking about buying options in that stock and it sort of, you know, squared the circle so to speak and started making sense and it was at that point that it was like, wow, we have to start paying attention to this. Some people on the platform really spend tons of time and others are just looking for entertainment and to have a little bit of fun effectively gambling or looking for an outlet trying to make a little bit of money. And on top of all of that, there were stimulus checks now clearly this money is going to people who need to use that to eat to live but there's a lot of people who use this money to invest in the stock market. And it's not just stock tips. People quote unquote, yolo their entire life savings or stimulus checks on a single stock. They post what is called gain and loss porn. Screen grabbing staggering hits and misses on stocks for the entire community to see. I am about to lose everything. And while some of the people on Wall Street bets are novice investors, the community contains multitudes. In one respect, what it did show us among these network groups is they are very sophisticated. They're not a bunch of ignorant people talking to other ignorant people. And this is where the pieces of the puzzle all come together to reach havoc on Wall Street for a solid week in early 2021. It's pretty clear that the combination of more people having retail brokerage accounts and trading apps and more people being stuck at home looking for some kind of entertainment and some kind of community online came together in this very singular way. What came together is GameStop. Let's go back to the beginnings of what happened with GameStop a couple of years ago. On the boards like Reddit and Stocktwist, a lot of people were talking about GameStop as being attractive value. Some of them are even, you know, Wall Street alums who left the industry and now still have access to tools that they can use to improve their financial well-being and make very good decisions. And I think Warren Kitty is a perfect example of that. GameStop is one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. Really I don't understand how you can disagree with that. At the same time that this crowd was talking it up, the hedge fund institutional crowd didn't like the stock at all and it had the largest short interest of any stock in the New York Stock Exchange going into late 2020. Short selling is a bet that a stock price will fall and it's a fairly simple concept. An investor borrows a stock and then sells it. The investor is betting on buying the stock back later for a lower price before returning it to the original owner pocketing the price difference. What a short seller would tell you is that they almost act as a policeman in financial markets or they're at least looking for companies that aren't what they say they are. And that can range anywhere from an outright fraud that some short sellers try to expose to just a company that's not worth as much as investors think it is. The problem is if the stock price rises, the short seller has to come up with the money to buy the stock back and the more it rises, the more it costs. And that's what's called a short squeeze and the hedge fund Melvin Capital was on the wrong end of that squeeze. Melvin Capital lost over 50% of its money in the month of January alone just from being caught in the short squeeze of the stock. This is where the disruption comes in. One of the most wild stories you're ever going to see, GameStop shares absolutely going nuts. In less than a year, the company's stock has jumped from less than $3 a share to almost $350. Cheers everybody. Roaring Kitty has turned $50,000 or so investment into some $14 million. Investors all over social media use the free trading app Robinhood to wreak havoc on Wall Street. They're actually piling on into some of these stocks to really hurt the professional short sellers. And they all used Reddit, Twitter, TikTok and Discord to tell one another to keep buying and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs. They're saying keep going. And it was working too. positive that there's positive compensateensive downtimes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2833,2022-10-14 14:58:22
14608," and quote, hold the line and not sell GameStop. People are getting cheerleaded for jumping in, buying at the highs, they're saying keep going. And it was working too, until. Thursday morning, the trading app Robinhood sent out this tweet. In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions, including GameStop. People were really angry. Robinhood was supposed to allow the regular people to play the same game, these big boys are playing. But instead, we were all taken for schmucks, and they screwed us. Shares of GameStop are jumping again now that retail investors are being allowed to buy shares of the stock. But what we learned is that when people organize online, they have the ability to disrupt the market. And it was a big sign that ivory rolls on the institution, aren't as powerful as maybe the institution has let them to be. I don't know, pumping out GameStop was the best use of billions of dollars. But I think that as a signal to society, it was pretty interesting and powerful. The GameStop saga was so impactful that both Vlad Teniv and Roryn Kitty were called into testify before Congress to clarify each of their roles in the saga. One thing that's emerged from the congressional hearings is that they're interested in how retail brokerages make money and whether they're keeping the best interest of their customers in mind. But it's pretty fuzzy as far as what they would actually do as a result. While the frenzy around GameStop eventually subsided, it didn't take long for retail investors to find other areas to invest their money. Take a bit of Bitcoin going bananas over the weekend. Bitcoin forms a brand new all-time high. It was after GameStop started to drop that we saw Bitcoin really go up to over 60,000. How much further does this rally have to run? It's compelling to say that money shifted from one venue to the other. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there's a chart out there showing an inverse correlation on meme stocks going down and cryptocurrencies going up. There's definitely an aspect where people are making money on stocks and then moving. They're agnostic. They're not hedge funds. They can invest wherever the hell they want. It's a classic sort of momentum trade. They're going to wherever the winners are and they're willing to jump on and ride it. So whether it's meme stocks like GameStop, meme coins like Dogecoin are entirely new ways to invest in art like NFTs, the new kind of retail investor is making its presence known. Over the next 10, maybe 15 years, you're going to continue to see whether by choice or by force, that baton go from older generations to younger generations. I don't think any single app is going to be the thing that disrupts. I think people are the disruptors. How people get ideas about what to invest in has become increasingly entwined with social media. And as social media companies govern more and more of our lives, the fact that now they're tied in more intimately to people's wallets is something that we might want to understand better. Usually what disruption I think means is technology comes in whether it's blogs to the newspapers or online, retailing to brick and mortar. They come in and they're in the same business, but they just do it in such a gigantic cost savings that it causes everybody to switch. Well, that's the risk that happens here is that it's so much cheaper to just manage your own money. We're not there yet, but costs and conveniences are moving in that direction. So I'd say Wall Street, you haven't been disrupted yet, but you could be in the coming years and that the final chapter on this story hasn't been written. Put your head out or try and go up your bed. Let's go for it. Go to the library. How are you guys?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2834,2022-10-14 15:02:33
14609," Meet Bloomberg's own David Nicholson. Now his happy place is out in the field, on the open road. But like the rest of the world lately, he's been working from home a lot more than he's used to. COVID-19 has prompted a massive urban exodus as professionals of every ilk yearn for more space to live and work. As a result, rural areas have exploded and their poised to experience a resurgence as more and more families pack up and leave the big city to try out life in the burbs. But there's one problem with that. Not all internet speeds are created equal. Anyone who might need to upload or download large files for a living may not want to pack up and move to that cabin in the woods just yet. Now David's house isn't a cabin, but it is in the woods, and inexplicably, his internet is workable. My internet is okay, I pay a lot for it, it's around $140 a month. The download speed is great, and the upload speed is terrible, which is really bad for my work because I have to upload these massive files. But I'm definitely one of the more lucky ones in this community. Just a few miles down the road, my buddy has awful internet. It's usually under two down and under point two up, so it's often unusable. Some days it's around one, and other times it'll drop down to about point two, point three. I just want to be able to have internet at my house without having to go outside the normal ways of acquiring internet. It's really frustrating. We're literally miles, a few miles away from downtown, and it just cuts off. This is a problem, and the solutions are not there yet, because getting high speed internet and rural areas on mass is something our providers may simply not be ready for. If your internet service doesn't have fast download and upload speeds, then you don't have high speed harmony. You have. Rural loans on average pay about $70 a month for internet at home. In rural areas, it could cost a lot more for a lot less service. The pricing for a fixed wireless provider here can be something between $80 and $150 for about $25 megabits per second. However, Gigabit service, which is a thousand megabits per second and Syventricle is running at about $119 a month through $130 a month. That's John Paul. He co-owns Spiral Fiber, an internet service provider here in Nevada County. California. And for the past 10 years, he's been trying to bring an affordable fiber optic network to town. It all started when he applied to be part of the pilot program for Google's fiber service. Across the country, Civic Boosters have been going to extreme, chanting, singing, and marching, trying to get the search engine giant to look at their town. The internet these days is crucial to be in the world, to be a part of the world, and to be connected to your community. Google ultimately went with Kansas City, Missouri, which left Paul on a mission to get funding to layout fiber optic networks for Gigabit service. Over the next several years, he would attend conferences and pitch venture capitalists and apply for grants to make his vision come to life. One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landstaked out. They would prefer that nobody come in and compete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2835,2022-10-14 15:06:46
14610," Pete against them. In 2013, we applied for a grant. We went down and met with the commissioners at the California Public Utilities Commission. It was an arduous process to get funded. But we finally did against all odds. We got a $60 million grant and then we went out to seek venture capital. Then in March of 2020, the pandemic hit the world. Everybody got locked down and everybody came home and everybody started using the Internet. And I remember seeing on one of the local fixed wireless providers websites, they've said, hey, we know you're all staying home. But please don't use too much video and please don't use too much bandwidth. And I thought that doesn't work. The US connectivity gap is far greater compared to countries that are considered its peers economically. Some developing nations actually have better Internet than rural America. Like in Kenya, which has a state-of-the-art fiber optic network fed in from their coastline. The American connectivity gap does largely affect rural areas that are either outside of service coverage or simply prohibitively expensive. This is Rebecca. She and her family moved to Nevada County just a couple miles down the road from David. They took for granted that high-speed Internet would just exist in the area and it's not something they even bothered to check on before buying their house. Turns out all they got was dial-up. We wanted to move where we had a little more space, room for the kids to run around, you know, just be out in the mountains a little bit more. Having come from a bigger city area where Wi-Fi is pretty readily available, we hadn't really considered that in our purchasing of the house, whether that would be an option or not. When school started and now that we are remote learning with our children and we're doing everything from home, we didn't have the option to do that at our house. So every day when school would start we'd have to pack the kids up and we'd go to my in-law home. They have a little cabin up in this area that does have Wi-Fi already. Rebecca's situation is the norm in rural America. According to data from the Federal Communications Commission, just 4% of urban Americans lack access to broadband Internet. That's compared to almost 40% of people who live in rural areas. While that was the case, there were also racial and socio-economic divides in terms of who had that access. In addition to that geographic difference, low-income African-American students, Latino students, and first generation of college students were more likely than others to have only one device at home that shared among multiple siblings and or lack access to that actual connection. For most American towns, there's also a lack of competition, forcing Internet prices up. And large providers like AT&T and Concast aren't incentivized to expand service to these rural communities. This is how Xfinity makes life simple and easy. So in our area, we have a small imprint of Concast, but they're not going to go out to the more rural areas. It's just not cost-effective for them to do it as a large company. In order to lay fiber cable, you're actually physically digging trenches into the ground. And for Internet service providers, they're primarily focused on maximizing their profits. And so the fewer customers you have in any square mile and the more fiber you have to lay, that's just kind of harder to pencil out from a purely economic standpoint. AT&T released a statement on the matter, expressing the need and desire for government assistance to fund fiber optic expansion to areas deemed unprofitable. Concast released a similar statement encouraging more public-private collaboration on this effort. Federal agencies do offer grants to help communities build broadband networks, but many have argued that there's not enough flexibility on how to use these funds. The COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress in March and signed by President Donald Trump awarded $43.3 million to 51 projects on the East Coast alone. But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30th. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance, it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline. So what we've been asking the federal government to consider is at least as long as the projects are getting started, knowing the projects are being put into place to expand both remote learning, working from home and opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time.

14611," opportunities like that that are truly driven from COVID. We're moving as fast as we can regardless, but hopefully they'll give us some more time. Talking to John Paul, it's clear that he believes broadband is something that can transform a community and should be considered a public good. One of the first communities to come on in the United States with full on gigabit service was Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now they're a bigger city, but there is city that was economically in a downturn. On the last 15 years, the city of Chattanooga has turned around in an amazing way. It's a nexus for young people to move to. It's a place where technology happens. It's not just about logging on to Zoom, to connect with your colleagues who might be in New York City. It's also your ability as a small business, operating in the town of Nevada City, or wherever it may be to quickly upload your payroll documents, or something onto the cloud, or to quickly swipe a customer's credit card. There's just some really basic business functions and mechanics that I think people in big cities really take for granted, and that are just gonna be a much bigger challenge for small business owners and rural areas. One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, five, six, eight, seven, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, ten. Historically, the marginalized people, you call them as untouchables or dhaliths, they have been kept away from the center of the knowledge. Once you're born into a caste, it is very difficult for you to grow beyond that. You are stuck in that identity. Education is the best way of liberating them, so that's how I chose to work in education sector. The kind of education that we are giving to the marginalized people is going to change, not just the fate of these communities, but it is going to be the source of inspiration, a source of hope for all the marginalized in this country. Greatest flight in India is the system of caste. For generations of Indians, the social code known as the caste system has defined how people earn a living and whom they marry. Although outlawed seven decades ago, caste remain a significant factor in deciding everything, from family ties and cultural traditions to educational and economic opportunities. Dalits, people who are on the lowest rung of the caste system, constitute almost one-fifth of India's population of 1.3 billion. Not able to afford the high tuition of private schools, many are forced to attend government-funded institutions, which in the past have suffered from poor infrastructure, lower education standards, and high student-to-teacher ratios. But Dr. Praveen Kumar is trying to change that. I am currently working as head of the Lungana Social Welfare Residential Schools. So totally, above 400 schools I manage, these are all residential schools for the students who are historically marked.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2837,2022-10-14 15:15:37
14612," for residential schools. So totally about 400 schools I managed. These are all residential schools for the students who are historically marginalized but talented and then poor. My friends also are... Of them 60% are girls and then 40% are boys because girls are more marginalized among the marginalized. Their voices are always suppressed. My approach to improve the conditions in the schools has been put your eyes and ears on the ground always. Stock to the parents, stock to the teachers, stock to the students, you know, stay in the schools and then understand their problems, their challenges, both in classrooms and then the corridors and the dorms. Then go to the dining halls and see what kind of food they are eating and then go to their homes and then what kind of food they are getting and what kind of challenges the parents have. One of the important changes that I brought in after I took over was to complete the transformation of mother tongue to English medium because English medium, as I said, English is the language of emancipation and language that connects you to the whole body of knowledge in the world. So we had to train a lot of teachers. Hey Ritri, how are you? I seem to find thank you and have a good view. I find it a lot. Identity is extremely important. There is a scientific evidence to prove that, you know, your sense of identity is extremely crucial to your growth as a successful human being in your life. If you accept an identity which is very humiliating, which reminds you of very painful past, I think that identity will not help you to grow. Not that I am not saying that you should forget your past, I am not saying that but that should not be the bubble in which you must live always. Sweros is an alternative identity. S stands for state, W stands for welfare, Aero, SW and then Aero is Swero. So the idea is your dreams have to be skybound. So that is what we are trying to achieve by changing the identities. Like you know, you say I am a Swero and I aim to be a doctor. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top-notch engineer. I am a Swero. I aim to be a top bureaucrat of this country. I am a Swero. I want to be a very good actor or you know musician in this world. So these are the positive images that are associated with identity. Just to give an example to you. See in 2012, in our institution we used to produce about 6 doctors per year but because of our you know, this self-eliberating ideology of Sweroism, we have this year we have produced about 189 doctors. This is phenomenal for any poorest of the poor people. You know how difficult it is to get into a medical college in this country. So but today because of this ideology, the students have been able to achieve this you know, you know. Pujita has been a form labourer and a parent's, the angels are agricultural labourers and then this girl used to sell vegetables but thanks to the residential education institutions, she came to the Gowlido D campus and then she toiled very hard for one year despite many problems and today I am so happy to share with you that you know, she has joined one of the prestigious medical colleges in the state of Telangana, Usman in medical college and then in future she hopes to be a gynecologist. So this is the journey our children are hoping for us. Similarly the month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2838,2022-10-14 15:19:37
14613," in our children and hoping for us. Similarly, the Mount Everest Expression. Mount Everest Expression, we are very fortunate enough to place the youngest ever female in the history of this world on the peak of Mount Everest. How did this happen? It's all because of an ideology that helps you to liberate yourself. We have a lot of extra-curricular activities and most of them got institutionalized now. So, for example, music. Similarly, the games, we have so many coaching academy, boxing academy, Brazilian academy, we have handball academy. So, we have Kabadi, the traditional Indian sport. We have gold. We have introduced gold falls, like gold fees generally played by so-called rich people. But today, even poorest of the poor people also are being trained in gold in our schools. So, our intention has been to give all 360 degrees type of opportunities to the students. So, the top, you know, whoever is interested in whatever activity they can go and then do it. Break the barriers. Break the fence at least mentally. Because poor people have been programmed to be victims, programmed to be subjugated, programmed to be on the margins, always. Programmed to feel inferior, we wanted to change all that. There are certain games which are exclusive to rich people. There are certain languages which are exclusive to middle class and upper middle class in this country. To put it in one world. The soul aim of introducing all these co-curricular activities is to break the stereotypes which are recklessly imposed on these people. Their stereotypes, Dr. Kumar knows all too well. Born a Dalit, his grandparents were laborers and access to the village well was restricted. Dr. Kumar credits his parents' belief in the power of education with helping him realize his aspirations. He went on to join the Indian Police Service, attended Harvard University and then began pursuing educational reforms back home. I attribute whatever I am today to my mother primarily. They educated me in the village, although there were no good schools. So then I stayed in social welfare hostels, the hostels which are managed by government for the poorest of the poor kids. I passed with, you know, reasonably good grades. Then I went to university and then I faced a worst form of discrimination. The university is like, there were, you know, in those days I am talking about. So the bathrooms and the toilets were exclusively meant for social care, so I tried. I used to fight discrimination on one hand and then again, you know, try to excel in academics day in and day out. So that's how I came to education because I deeply believe that education is the only important weapon that can really, you know, place the poorest of the poor people from a very victimhood orbit to prosperous orbit. I think in future this is going to get game changer for the marginalized in this country.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2839,2022-10-14 15:24:02
14614," If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation, you'll find that where there's greenery, the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt, concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities, often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing urban populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event, more than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods. That's why urban heat island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learnt to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world, starting with Singapore. In Singapore, close to the equator, temperatures regularly rise above 32 degrees Celsius or 90 degrees Fahrenheit and the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the case for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle, more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7 degrees Celsius between the more urbanized and the more rural areas. The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down. This is Gardens by the Bay, an award-winning park and inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24 degrees. That's because the dome, along with two dozen nearby towers full of thousands of people, is chilled by what's probably the world's largest underground district cooling system. It uses a large central plant that cools water and then pipes it into banks, residential towers and exhibition centre, shopping malls and the city's iconic Marina Bay sounds hotel and casino complex. So one of the biggest perks of using this system for the buildings is that they can save 40% in terms of electricity usage compared to your traditional air conditioners. And with Singapore relying on natural gas for most of its power, this new system means emission savings equivalent to removing 10,000 cars from the city's roads. That has big implications for the rest of the world. If things stay as they are, more than a third of the world's electricity could end up being used to call buildings and vehicles by 2050. As the world gets hotter, gets warmer, there is a greater need for air conditioning and as well as refrigerators for instance. The more people are buying these household appliances, the more energy usage they use and they release heat more and that then exacerbates climate change. It's a vicious circle and so since 2017, researchers at cooling Singapore have been identifying design solutions that reduce our need for so much cool air in the first place. One thing many cities have in common and that's the importance of vegetation. That's a very important measure to mitigate the urban heat because of the shading effect of course and the psychological effects of the vegetation and also because of the possible evaporative cooling effect of the vegetation. Vegetation can be of course on the ground floor in form of trees and shrubs and you can walk under them, this is the so called canopy layer that the vegetation forms above us but vegetation can also go up the facades of buildings and it can go to the roof of the buildings. Luckily Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2840,2022-10-14 15:28:19
14615," The buildings. Luckily, Singapore has been striving for the garden city feel for quite some time. It was a vision initially introduced by them Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in 1967 to make life more pleasant for people. And today, Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities in terms of urban vegetation. Campong Abmalty, a community centre that contains health facilities and social spaces, now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on. It's topped by a roof scape of staggered terraces covered in local plants, which functions as a community park. And a village green in the centre that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park Royal on Pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15,000 metres of sky gardens, reflecting pools, waterfalls, plantar terraces and green walls. And the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban hit island effect. But on the other hand, it's also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough. The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the wild average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures. When you try to mitigate your heat island effect in a city or in any building, in a village as well, the first place to start is by shading off the windows. You have to keep areas clear so that the wind can move through it. Water of a certain depth can act as a very good thermal buffer. If you have to construct heavy buildings such as high rises, at least you can make the surface the facade less heavy and you can protect it from direct sun penetration. You have to make sure that no combustion engines will be in the city in the middle and the medium to long term range. So ideally the electricity production is outside of the city and you bring just the clean electricity into the city. You can at least minimize the use of energy in the city and you can start to slowly convert the roofs, the facades of the city into production areas for renewable energy. In Singapore unfortunately this is a limited option but in the long run it could produce up to 20, 25% of the energy of the electricity needed in Singapore if all the roofs and the areas in the buildings on the buildings on the facades would be used to do that. With so many different ideas, cooling Singapore is also designing a virtual model of the city to test them out. It's called a digital urban climate twin or duct that will calculate how each element of the city's design will impact the urban heat island effect. That means we model not only the geometry of the buildings digitally but also we model the transportation, the insulation, the temperature, the radiation coming from the sun, the weather, the local weather, the local climate, the even very very microclimate of the city. The water, the movement of people in the city, we can invent scenarios, we can design scenarios, test them before we actually build them and if they test very well and we are sure that they will function then we can start to build them and put them into reality. Singapore will be using this new tool to figure out which actions it should take next and the model can be applied to any city whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2841,2022-10-14 15:32:40
14616," Whether it needs to keep heat out or keep heat in, which will ultimately save energy, slow climate change and improve our quality of life. So this is something that Singapore will be able to export, maybe even together with its city development systems that it already has. Singapore is one of the very few cities in the world that really combined this scientific approach with a very well-established urban redesign and design approach towards agencies and the combination of its agencies. It has achieved a lot in the past. If it keeps following the scientific path and the combination with the other knowledge in the city already, we think that it will be a very comfortable and very livable city in the future even more than today. Time's a tough. Jobs are scarce. It's risky to be outside and around others. It seems like there's very few ways to make extra money during a pandemic. So I guess I'll just hunker down and binge social media until this all blows over. Wait, don't these people make money? How do these people make money? Streamers, YouTubers, Twitch stars, how do they make money? Is it a lot? Is it a lot of work? I know. I gotta ask somebody in the biz and I got just the guy, Austin John plays. This is your full-time job now, right? As of November of last year, yes. This was always just kind of like a side thing. Any money that I made from doing my videos and whatever else, I never touched that because I didn't really think of that as being real money. And then it started coming in more and more. And then I hit my first day that I broke a grand and I was like, this is actually gonna be money. How did the YouTube channel come to be? When the game Pokemon Sun and Moon came out for the 3DS, there was things that I learned about the game and then I wanted to just share that information with people. And at the time, I didn't have any way to capture screen or anything. So I found like generic footage and I kind of put it all together with so much editing. And that video got six views. And then two days later, I made another one. And that one got 12 views. And then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself. And then it was like, my channel really focuses on tips and tricks. So I play a straight 18 hours. And I'll finish the game or get to about the 40 hour mark. And then I'll make my first video. While I'm going through, I have a giant no pad and just scribbles everywhere. And I make these notes of like the things that stumped me. So I know the things that may stump other people. What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel? One, you need to do something that you're passionate about. Not that you like. Not that you think you're going to make money on something you're passionate about. This other thing is something that other people are passionate about. It holds a special place to them. And third is, it needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better. You're going to need to be better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2842,2022-10-14 15:36:59
14617," It needs to be something that people are going to seek out information on. In order to enter into the marketplace, you either need to be better than everyone else. You either need to be faster than everyone else, or you need to be more accessible than everyone else. And you can't be more accessible because it's already on the platform granted. If you understand how the algorithm works, which is very similar to Google Analytics, then yeah, you can have a little bit of a head start. But if you're not doing it faster, and if you're not doing it better than everyone else, then why should anyone watch your channel? So my income as a YouTuber kind of breaks down to three different ways. One, which is the bulk of it, which is ad revenue. Whenever you go and you watch a video, and then there's an ad, and then you wait five seconds, and you hit the bottom right corner, and then you go on to the next video, or a non-skippable ad, or the video starts immediately, you get the little banner ads at the bottom, or if you scroll down from the video, the first thing that shows there is an ad. Those are the four different types of ads that can appear on every single YouTube video. And all of them pay a certain amount. It varies on lots of things, like the country of the person who posted, the country of the person who watches it, the time of year, where you are in the quarter, if there's anything going on with a reduction in ad revenue. Like, great example. COVID-19 companies weren't as spending as much on advertising. So because of that, CPM went down. CPM stands for a click per thousand, and using the Roman numeral for a thousand. And that means that for every one thousand views, you get a certain amount of money. Now, on low ads, when I first started off, my CPM was 30 cents. So every thousand views, I made 30 cents. But then once I signed with an MCN, and I started making more quality content and more engaging content, some of my better videos, and certain times of the year, I can see CPMs as high as 12 to 14 dollars. And there's a big fluctuation between, you know, if I post a video, when there's no ads being spent like January and February, that's a reason a lot of your favorite YouTubers. And also TV shows don't post new videos in that time of year, because ad rates are down. Why are they going to make content then? Instead, you're recording and you're bulking up for when ad revenue is higher. The second way that a YouTuber makes income is support, crowdfunding, things like that. When I first started off, Patreon was really the only option. But then they started rolling out supporters and members for YouTube channels. So whenever I have a live stream, you can click a button, and then you could become a member, and then you get a special icon's next to your name, I believe they're called badges, or on any video, you can hit the join button, and that helps support the channel. And then the third aspect of that would be merch. And for me, my merch has been somewhat basic. In fact, I'm wearing one of my t-shirts from last year right now. You have to endure the times that your first video gets six views, that you post it on Reddit, and they say, shut up, and then an auto mod bands you. You have to go through that, because until you go through that, and you discover why you're doing it, you're not doing it for other people, you're doing it for yourself. If you're not loving what you do, then it's not worth it. Huh. So make a channel about something that I'm passionate about. Oh, sweet. I guess I can make the channel about that. Now, how do I grow an audience? How do I get popular? It's all about diversification. You have to have a massive Twitter following. You have to have a massive Instagram following. You have to have a massive YouTube following. Of course, you have to be on Twitch, which is the key platform. But basically, anyway, you can get in front of your audience. You can engage with your audience. And it is going to drive those clicks, which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you can.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2843,2022-10-14 15:41:30
14618," You can get in front of your audience, you can engage with your audience, it is going to drive those clicks which ultimately drives the advertiser revenue that you get back from all of these platforms. It's me and Dan playing video games and talking in a funny manner over them. They're not just people who are good at games, they're actually people who are good at online engagement, online entertainment, first and foremost. You have the right to remain stylish, anything you wear can and will be used to use the GC in the quarter fashion. The streamer is either very, very talented at the game. The best player in the game is generally going to draw a crowd because people like watching people who are very good. On the other hand, they're either very, very good or funny, charismatic, whatever it is on that side. Oh no! You know, it becomes more of a show where they talk about other things outside of the gaming world and gaming becomes really just a backdrop and an excuse to engage with our audience. There were those weird Ronald McDonald, like straight to VHS movies, remember those? I'm personable, I'm chatty, I would kind of, you know, when boring things were happening in the game, I would ramble on about, you know, movies I'd watched or books I'd read or conversations I'd had and stuff like that. And so I think being personable was a big part of that. It's not just getting on and playing games, it's getting on and being an entertainer. You are putting on a show. All right, now let me go ahead and grab the samurai sword that every gym has. Okay, he's dead. To have a larger audience and to have that audience, I think, stay with you. You have to bring something extra, you know, you have to find your niche, you have to find what works and what connects with the audience and what makes them laugh and what makes them keep coming back. Then you gotta make it a little more exciting, all right? Throwing a hanging bishop, have everybody in suspense for a moment. I think the real most important thing is to just get used to being on camera. Like in any sort of performance thing is get used to talking on camera. You know, my first few videos were terrible. But because I sat down and did it for six to eight hours a day, I just got used to talking and I got over that uncomfortable hump. If you go into Twitch purely with the expectation that you're going to make money, make a job out of it, have all this growth and it's going to be great. You're probably going to burn out prior to getting to that point because there's very little payoff for a long time, right? Like multiple years generally before you really start to see a payoff. And so, you know, those first few times you're streaming, nobody is there. One person shows up every 30 minutes says hi, maybe, and leaves, right? Like it's very discouraging, I think, for a lot of people. And so you have to be there just loving it. You have to love talking to yourself when nobody is around. You have to love just the game that you're playing, all of that stuff because it takes a while and I think a majority of people burn out prior to getting to the like profitable point of it. There you have it. My very own YouTube, Twitch, Discord, and streaming channels all ready to go live. It's a veritable social media ecosystem just on the verge of thriving. So don't forget to smash like and subscribe and visit my Patreon for perks. Also, go to my merch page. And one last thing, stay cool, my friends.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2844,2022-10-14 15:45:50
14619," This is live stream shopping, one of the hottest trends in China. It's not about only shopping, it's about the experience, it's about having fun. You got to see 3D, you got to see in some kind of action. It's almost like a theatre act. The internet craze has taken over China. By the end of 2020, the country had almost 400 million live stream shopping users. China's live stream e-commerce market has also grown dramatically, with an estimated value of $161 billion in 2020. It's becoming popular outside China as well. So it's live streaming the future of shopping. Live streaming is not a new thing, and China is started in 2015 with the rollout of 4G, and it was first used for entertainment and socializing. Many live streamers perform for their followers or chat it to them, making money by receiving virtual currency and gifts. In the last live streaming is mainly the doing of avid gamers, and China is broken into e-commerce. China actually has a very big e-commerce empire, so it uses these super apps, what we call that. You have payment, you have search of information, you have recommendation system, and you have huge amount of goods available on the platform, and as well as a lot of consumers. So with this advantage, they merge these features of live streaming to make the influencers actually sell goods. Here is a perfect choice, nice neutrals, beautiful prints, nothing overwhelming, and the warmth and comfort of flannel. Traditional TV shopping involves one way direction whereby a host introduces a product, demonstrates things, and say call this number or something, but live stream shopping is live. That in itself is a very big difference, they call this different psychology, and live stream shopping is a very entertaining way of engaging someone else. When you shop, actually this live streaming video will continue, it will minimize into a corner, and you can buy the items and pay all on the same app. After that, the live streaming screen will just enlarge by itself, and the promoter will come back to screen. So it's very convenient. How about one of China's biggest e-commerce platforms owned by TechGyne Alibaba, added a live streaming function in early 2016? In the following years, other e-commerce and social platforms like JD and Do-In also integrated this feature. Some stores are consumed by the Beyond 보면 There are a lot of programs which would let players know, production, editing and 딸,வர, etc, but there are lots of buttons, such as it creates a variety of messages, such as Facebook button, YouTube Box, normal stuff, attracting groove and onlinez- sighing, etc. Time for time? in the year through March 2021. Latest surveys show that over 60% of live stream users in China were watching shopping shows, and over 65% of them shopped at least once via live stream. In 2020, live stream shopping got a huge boost during the pandemic. With millions of people were in lockdown and many retailers were pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2845,2022-10-14 15:50:15
14620," and many retailers who are pushed online. People during the lockdown felt like there's a need for more social interactions. This live platform creates an interesting environment that these people the sense that I'm actually interacting with. And the live stream shopping brings in a lot more variety of things that people could buy and satisfy, in a sense of like musical control especially during the pandemic. At the heart of this craze are the top influencers who have tens of millions of followers and sub-products worth millions of dollars every night. They often use their stop power to get bargains from retailers which in turn boosts their own sales and influence. So if you think about China's live streaming you have to know the king and queen of the influencers. The queen of live streaming VIA she is actually having the biggest viewership and the biggest sales volume for a long time on top of the platform. She can sell everything from like Gucci sunglasses, lipstick, homes and cars. One time she offered her followers to go on a Tesla ride with her and she even for once. So they rocky launch in her live streaming room for 40 million yuan. The king VIA was widely known as lipstick spreader. He used to be a cosmetic sales before he turned into live streaming commerce. And he knows a lot about the cosmetics. So he's the one that will actually put the lipsticks on himself when he's on the show. Top live streamers like VIA and Li Jiaqi have become celebrities in China and earn millions of dollars a year. Although not everyone can be as popular, mid-ranking live streamers like Tiffany still and a good income through sales commissions. I think fans want to have a grand experience of them. It's why we made those three topbaes channel which helps create big spectacle THROUGH to effectively make such a big car than nothing new. If you don't have a job, you can buy it. A lot of successful live streamers are generally very good at communication. They are very good at articulating very simply what the product does, what the product doesn't do. In order for them to sell, they need to be trustworthy and appear trustworthy. And they need to show in some ways that they are authentic. So, for VIA and Li Chasi, they are able to articulate that quite a bit through their body language, through what they say. For example, Li Chasi will always say bad things about certain products. Because to him, there is an honest opinion and sometimes people want to hear that. And so, they seem very credible, they seem very trustworthy. And don't forget, they are also very entertaining and very interesting. If you are familiar with Li Chasi, you want a Guinness record for the most lipstick applications to models in a 30 seconds. So, if you are able to create a lot of bass, you can just think things that you do. People who may not want to buy lipsticks, but also streaming just to watch what he does. And then from there, you might get hope to just shouldn't be buying you some tools and tools for the company. Live streamers also use sales techniques such as limited time or supply. These sense of scarcity can often encourage viewers to buy. The platform in itself creates and enhances some of these things. But you see it live. It's something because social proof has taken over, meaning that, hey, other people are interested, other people are joining in. Other people want the same product. And they add it in the chat and they ask questions and they say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers. Local.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2846,2022-10-14 15:55:01
14621," Same product, and they add in a chat and ask questions and say, oh, I want this too. What happens then? It makes the whole product even more scarce. But it's not just influencers, local farmers, luxury brands, even mutual funds, have also started their own livestream shows. Working with very top tier livestreamers can be risky. It's not necessary that the benefits will end up with a brand. So we see company executives opening their own shows. And we see like PNG have their own sales room which runs shows every day as well. We also have like local governors in like small towns to sell their agricultural products. So the livestreaming is definitely transformed the way product owners can think about how to reach their consumers and enables a lot of players to actually sell. The livestream shopping is going global. Merchants in Southeast Asia have embraced this trend. And in the West, Amazon has upgraded its livestreaming function and interactive features like chat rooms. Companies, including Google and Facebook are also developing and investing in technologies to integrate video and e-commerce. If you look at the numbers alone, their numbers alone, the chassis is number so be it. You know that they can sell and you know that they can generate revenue. Are they able to sustain it over a long period of time? It depends on how you know very they are at changing some of the things that they do. But you can't expect consumers one day turn into virtual shopping for good. There will be the nature of us that crave to go into the store to touch the goods and actually wear it and see how it looks like and walk around that with our friends. And those things wouldn't be replaceable with livestreaming. Imagine that the oceans are actually the largest battery. We store a huge amount of energy in the oceans. The wave of motion can be very deep. It can extend down several hundred meters. It gets to the near shore from about 50 meters. The whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory, waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year enough to power more than half of the country. Waves intensify and subside not just quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smooth power generation curve. One of the potential advantages of wave energy is that it could act as a complementary source of power compared to other renewables on the grid if it were to be scaled up to a commercial scale. For decades, engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity but a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated developments. In the years from around 2006 to 2015, there were a state of bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely the cause.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2847,2022-10-14 15:58:38
14622," Complicated by office in the years from around 2006 to 2015 there were a space of bankruptcies in the sector and this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous proven projects out at sea with reliable electrosis generation. Since then companies have been trying to develop the technologies that are steady apace and with a smaller cash burn. For the same questions remain, can companies develop devices and technologies that actually work? Is wave energy just a novelty or something that can become a major renewable energy source? The sea is a very challenging environment within which to operate a power project. So sea water is corrosive and conditions are very rough so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that many early wave energy projects hit rough waters such as the Pellarmus Wave Energy Converter in Portugal and the ILA Limpet Project in Scotland. But that hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out at sea, proving their durability, trying to raise capital and bring down cost. The sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of undersided about which design works best. Finland-based AW Energy is a veteran in the sector. The first proof of concept of the company's device was made in the 90s after Diver, Rano, Coivissari observed the strong back and forth movement of a hatch cover in a shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. The waves are generated far from the coastline so the wind blows on the surface of the water causing the water particles to rotate. And that rotation extends deep down below the surface and the waves can be very long, they can be several hundred meters long. And as they come into the near shore this rotational energy turns into an elliptical energy and eventually back to the force that you probably noticed if you've been swimming on the sea shore in large waves, you're pulled in and out. That's the energy that we're extracting. There's a sweet spot where we deploy, so around 10 to 15 meters of water depth, that's where there's still strong wave energy coming in. After years of research, prototyping and testing, the company has deployed Wave Roller, a 350 kilowatt device in the waters of Portugal. Wave Roller has an 80 meter wide and 10 meter high steel panel fixed to the seabed via a flotable foundation. The panel moves back and forth with the waves capturing the energy. It's submerged in the depth of 15 meters, so it's protected from the extreme waves. We generate electricity by capturing the movement with hydraulic circuitry in a machine room underneath the surface. That hydraulic energy we turn to electricity with hydraulic accumulators and hydraulic motors and also our generator. The Wave Roller has survived large waves at sea for over a year and delivered electricity via an underwater cable to the grid in Portugal. Meanwhile, the company has won a 2.5 million euro grant to work on an upgraded version of the Wave Roller, aiming to increase the electricity generation capacity to 1 megawatt. The upscale device would have a bigger panel, two power takeoff units and improved software to control the energy production. We have taken into use a very prediction algorithm that tells us what kind of waves are coming into our device. That gives us a few seconds to prepare for capturing more energy and the difference in that is significant. Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. I'm hoping we can be working on the Wave Roller.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2848,2022-10-14 16:03:00
14623," Our future plans are to deliver technology around the world. So I'm hoping we can be working on delivering technology to projects in Asia and also in American contents as well. Meanwhile, Israeli company EcoWavePower is taking a different approach to capturing the power of the ocean. For the company's founder, Inne Breveman, developing new sources of renewable energy is a personal mission. I was born in Ukraine in 1996 and two weeks after I was born, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, causing the largest in history, nuclear disaster. I was one of the babies that got hurt from the negative effects of such explosion. I had the respiratory arrest and a clinical death. Luckily my mother and nurse approached my crib on time and gave me a mouth-to-mouth resuscitation with saved my life. I got a second chance in life and decided to do something good with it. Growing up, Inne wanted to be a politician to positively change the world. After working as a translator at a renewable energy company, she decided to change parts. Solar and wind energy were fully commercialized. There were a lot of amazing technologies implemented everywhere. I saw that wave energy, although it's an immense source of electricity, the biggest companies in the world are trying to develop wave energy with no success. And there was kind of a race going on in the world of who is the company that is going to develop a viable wave energy solution first. In 2011, the then 24-year-old Inne co-founded EcoWavePower. Instead of installing devices offshore, the company's devices are attached to existing breakwaters, jetties and peers. Our technology is very cost-efficient, especially in comparison to the offshore technologies, because we don't need any ships, divers, underwater mooring or cables when Stalin-existent man-made structures and all our expensive equipment, the generator, the hydraulic conversion unit, the automation, is located online just like a regular power station. This is the EcoWave Power Conversion Unit that has been operating in Jaffa Port since 2014 until 2020. Here you can see how the technology works. Basically, the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro-tilinders which transmit by the great of a fluid into land-located accumulators. A pressure is being built, the higher the waves, the higher the pressure, which is used to turn the hydro-motor, which is turning the generators. The whole system is controlled by a smart automation system, which you can see right here. And in case of a coming storm, the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the upward position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid-connected device in Gibraltar since 2016, which is enough to power 100 households. Currently, Innu and her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Ported Jaffa in Tel Aviv. The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid. And our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable breakwaters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply a significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today, engineers and entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally, only a few hundred kilowatts of wave energy are deployed, compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the field has come a long way in recent years, and with the right engineering solutions, this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success of wave energy companies today, as opposed to like 20 years ago. But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like Ireland.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2849,2022-10-14 16:07:21
14624," But in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades, it will be more likely to be used in remote locations, like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power, or out at sea on gas decommissioning rigs or for powering underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely, wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources, but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world, we need all renewable energy sources to work together. So can you please tell me? I'm not going to throw my phone. Please wait. You know, I've covered a lot of companies, I've covered a lot of Machiavellian companies, where people play rough. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the scale, or any sort of business. One of the most dramatic elements was the most-revendor Passe's home being raided by court officials in Yokohama. You scared my children. I love these at the 60's. So Rob Passe's journey into the darkest recesses of the Japanese corporate world started when he was the general council, the highest corporate lawyer position in the company. In the past few minutes, Nissan has revealed that its chairman has been arrested after allegations of serious misconduct. He was tasked with investigating Carlos Gaulle, and he was told conduct an internal investigation and get to the heart of the matter. And then along the way, he started to notice serious conflicts of interest. He is one of the few people who knows an extreme amount of detail regarding the alleged crimes by Carlos Gaulle, and he's now ready to tell his own story on the record about some of the events that happened. My name is Ravinda Passe. I'm the former Global General Counsel of Nissan Motor Co. Limited. And you could say, yes, I had a front row seat in terms of the name of a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2850,2022-10-14 16:11:42
14625," Passy, I'm the former Global General Counsel of Nissan Motor Co. Limited. And you could say, yes, I had a front row seat in terms of what was going on. When Carlos Gone saved Nissan years ago, he was depicted in Japanese comic books as this hero. And now maybe we'll see comic books where he's the villain. In corporate Japan, Nissan was quite an unusual company. It was led for two decades by a non-Japanese executive. Well, Carlos Gone was a hero in the Japanese business world. If you had a global business celebrity in Japan and worldwide, it was definitely Carlos Gone. In a country with few foreigners at the top, he stood out. But over the years, he saved Nissan from bankruptcy, allied with Renault and Mitsubishi, and turned the alliance into one of the most competitive in the world. Yet as the years went on, I think his ambitions changed a little bit. He started thinking about legacy plays. And one of them was to really tighten the alliance between Renault and Japan. And unbeknownst to him, there was a contingent of senior Nissan executives that were really felt threatened by that move. They really thought that they would lose complete control of the car company. And even in the government, there was probably a little bit of anxiety about a national champion in the auto industry following under full-blown foreign control. Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. Now he's in jail. The rest of Carlos Gone came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018. He was coming to Japan on Nissan's corporate jet for a regular executive meeting. And he was met on the tarmac by Japanese authorities who whistled him away to jail and charged him with financial misconduct crimes. So what happened was a power struggle ensued inside the company. And somewhere along the way, it was criminalized. And by that, I mean that there were allegations leveled at Carlos Gone about the way he reported his pay to Japanese authorities, the way he handled money inside the company, that in other contexts, it might have been a board action, it might have been handled internally. A number of executives at Nissan decided to take this difference and take it over to the Tokyo Prosecutors Office. And that unleashed a chain of events that would shake the entire auto industry. So after Carlos Gone was arrested, Nissan launched an internal investigation into the events that led up to his arrest. So Rob Pasey was tasked with investigating Carlos Gone. And he was told, get to the heart of the matter. Find out what Carlos Gone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders. It's really complicated because you had various things coming out of the weeds. 2018 investigation has started and we become aware of matters in terms of conflicts, actions by certain individuals that cause some concern because things might not quite be what they seem. So in our story, we really took a close look at Harinata and his role in Carlos Gone's downfall. Harinata is one of the most fascinating figures inside Nissan. He's also a lawyer. He's originally Malaysian. How do Mr. Huddy? And he had a meteoric rise through the company and became very, very close to Carlos Gone and other top figures. He had a front row seat at all the major strategic deliberations at the company. And when he discovered that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renault and Nissan, he made...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2851,2022-10-14 16:16:02
14626," that Carlos Gone as his final legacy play was going to tighten the relationship between Renaud and Nissan. He made a decision to go against Carlos Gone and he became one of the key figures that decided that Carlos Gone had to go. Harry Nadal was somebody who actually recruited me into the company. So I have a long standing relationship with him or did have a long standing relationship with him. For many many years he was a mentor. I had doubts about the credibility of the process right at the start. Harry Nadal had a plea deal with the Tokyo secuters. Now that suggests he was intrinsically involved in some of the wrongdoing or the allegations of wrongdoing. It just didn't smell right, it just doesn't sit right. So there was a basic conflict of interest. In other words, Harry Nadal had to deliver results to Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gone. Some of the people who had been involved in the original alleged crimes were also looking into the affairs themselves. Revender Pasi began pointing out some of these conflict of interest issues. And the reason for that is essentially his concern was for the company. If the company's own investigation into itself was compromised, that could lead to a very weak position in various lawsuits that it was dealing with across the world. I had discussions with Harry, discussions about with the statutory auditors about these conflicts, discussions with HR about some of these conflicts. At that point, we reported into him. At the time everything was quite, as you can imagine, we've got to do this, we've got to do that, we've got to move fast. But when you step back and look at some of these things, you just think, my God, what was going on here? Because me, members of my team, were being placed in immediate danger. Your chairman has been arrested. A representative director has been arrested. They both happen to be foreigners. And then now what we need to do, we're being instructed to do, is certain compliance professionals need to go into properties in Brazil, for example, and retrieve evidence. They've got to do it very carefully, because if they don't do it carefully, they're going to get convicted of criminal activities. And likewise, when a team of lawyers were commissioned to go to Lebanon, I mean one of my immediate concerns was why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers, they're corporate lawyers from Nissan. You had revelations that a number of executives had benefited from share appreciation rights when they shouldn't have. I mean, you know, substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think, yes, how is this going to look later on? It's going to look quite concerning. So that triggered, for me, the sort of assessment that, well, I'm going to have to do something, because up until this point, I haven't put down on paper these conflicts and these issues.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2852,2022-10-14 16:20:26
14627," So, Rob Passey makes a fateful move. He writes his letter to the board, listing every suspicion he has in great detail, backed up by evidence, backed up by memos of why this internal investigation had serious problems. He sends a letter to the board and it's crickets. He doesn't hear much of anything. Nothing happened that often. Nothing at all. Just like it just gone into a black box. And he began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug. Unfortunately for me, I think, again with hindsight, people must have thought that this is the nail that's sticking out and we can't have this. Within three days of me submitting that to the board of directors, that letter to the independent board of directors, I was removed from the going executive conduct matters. I was then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore. And up until that point, I had attended every single board meeting. I was then also told that after eight years of being in Japan, I'd be going back to the UK. Eventually transpired that I'd be the VP of projects and transformation, managing a team of three. So you can imagine what this feels like at this stage. Almost an arbitrary removal from Japan where I've lived for eight years, had three children there. My family has grown up and we've been saddled there. Having a few months earlier been promoted to vice president at a global level to being almost demoted. So Pasi was essentially being reassigned to get him as far away from the internal investigation as possible and also to a certain extent in retaliation to some of the issues that he brought up regarding the internal investigation and Harinata. What happened to Rav Pasi can be seen as a series of corporate humiliations. I mean, first of all, his immediate responsibilities were taken away from him. Eventually he'd lost the coveted general council title. But it didn't stop there. Toward the end of his stay in Japan, Rav and his wife were convinced that they were being followed. During that period, I'd noticed that once driving my car, I'd have other cars following me. First I noticed this was around mid-March and I was driving. I can't remember where I was going, but this grave van, small van just literally started following me. And I noticed that there was somebody in the car taking pictures. And lo and behold, we were absolutely being followed by either by people on foot or other individuals, two or three normally two burly men in a car, different cars at different times following us around. They were following the family as well. And given we'd seen, right seen, the Nissan Security Department behaving a very, very egregious manor with others in terms of following and surveilling, I was very concerned as to what they were doing and who they were giving this information to. Because if they're giving this information to the authorities, you do think, why? What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in rather dramatic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2853,2022-10-14 16:24:36
14628," What's going on there? I mean, this is just not normal behavior. And this all culminated in a rather dramatic event in the middle of 2020. Who are you people where Nissan had hired a legal team and had obtained an unusual court order from the District Court in Oklahoma to basically do a search and of his home and seizure of his corporate laptop and phone and other documents. If you don't let us in now, we have to break this key. So it's a pretty extreme way to treat someone who had spent 16 years at the company. These people have all come in. We don't really know who they are apart from the fact that I've been shown a badge that says the Yokohama Court and they're here to recover a laptop and a mobile phone. It was even more weird because I'd highlighted to the directors that certain Nissan executives were trying to recover this laptop and this phone whilst I was still in Japan. And I was very concerned because it had evidence on there that related to misconduct matters and other forms of inappropriate conduct. It was just another form of intimidation, another form of harassment, forcing me almost to leave the company and the country. Because once they'd retained and obtained these items, we were still followed, which again I just couldn't understand what is the point of doing that. You know, this is not a car company, this is not the KGB. I think it's fair to say that Rob Posse didn't have full battlefield awareness of all the intrigue going on at Nissan. I mean, Harry Nata is interesting because he's both charismatic and charming and one of the most brutal corporate infighters one could ever run across. If that confidential company email, right, you should not have this. If he had fallen into line, he would probably still have his job at Nissan, be paid very well and continued his work. A career that he spent, you know, 16 years building at Nissan is irretrievably broken. It's been smashed to smithereens. He and his family paid a huge price certainly, but in terms of being able to sleep at night, I think, you know, he's come out ahead. I highlighted issues to the highest levels of the company so that they could be dealt with appropriately by those in charge. There was no response to those and there was retaliation against me. What's really profound, like absolutely profound, is that none of your colleagues, I mean people who you have known for years, forget it. You're on your own and you've got to be ready for that. If you take it on anyway.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2854,2022-10-14 16:28:57
14629," You you This is the awful truth There's always someone in the family that's pushing it This lady does not deserve to be taken advantage of It's like a very sad thing It's a family feud A family feud Here's a family that on paper you would think has the wealth that has been given to you So many people seek yet at the end of the day it's seen to rip everybody apart My name is Tom Schoenberg I'm a senior reporter here at Bloomberg News Cover financial enforcement I was approached by someone close to the Chantinstein family and asked whether or not I would be interested in writing about Beverly Chantinstein in this case that she had against JP Morgan It was immediately clear that there was a great story here to be told So I started just assembling all sorts of documents that the family made available to me I included a diary that Beverly had begun writing when she started having suspicions about what was actually going on with her money Beverly obtained her wealth from the Chantinstein kind of retail empire that has at times included big lots, value city, American Eagle outfitters, DSW shoes Beverly's husband died and at which point they sold off their portion of the company bringing them an enormous amount of wealth at around 1990 Estimates of her wealth were around $90 million She for many years had that pool of money being managed by outside advisers Her grandsons in the late 2000s had both graduated and were becoming financial advisers She gave them a little bit to work with and over time her grandson Evan became the trustee of her entire estate Managing sort of family money is not a conflict in fact some ways in wealth management It's kind of how you get your start it's kind of the seed that you need to sort of get going in the business But Beverly started having suspicions that something was wrong probably in around 2016 Well there were suspicious things but taken separately without everyone talking about their own experiences It was hard to really put it together She had written a check to her caretaker Dawn that bounced So she went down to her local chase branch to sort of find out what was going on She wasn't getting paper statements in the mail so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account So we went to the bank and asked her to print out a number of her statements",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2855,2022-10-14 16:33:05
14630," in the mail so she asked them to print out a number of her statements having to do with her checking account and her credit card account. So we went to the bank and asked for the statements and she got a whole year and going through all of them page by page by page. And it was there she saw all sorts of charges that she said she did not the riser didn't know about. I was becoming very very suspicious. I would start to look in the money part and that's what bothered me more when I saw that money was going and I was not a big spender. Around the same time Dawn she starts noticing Beverly's son who lived in the condominium below her came up with Evan with a shredder and started grabbing papers in her office area including some with JP Morgan Letterhead and just said started sitting at the kitchen table just shredding documents over and over. Yeah they came in one morning. I used to do it the back through the back door and they brought this shredder inside and then they went in the drawers in the office and took out all the papers and they started to do it. I was very suspicious because I know you don't go around and get in destroying papers. Beverly said that they had done this many times before. That's when she said to me you know Dawn I'm gonna write my feelings in this black book. Diary. And she started writing each day she would write a little at a time. Around the holidays of 2018 the package had arrived a FedEx package and in it were materials about a venture capital fund based out of the Cayman Islands. Dawn and some other family members take a look at this and they see that Beverly is signed up for this fund to the tune of about five million dollars over the course of several years. And that was really the beginning of it. That was sort of the tip of the iceberg when it became obvious that something was going on that my grandmother really wasn't aware of this fund. You know Beverly started to panic. She was got really upset and called you know JP Morgan's headquarters in New York and asked for Jamie Diamond. She said she was told someone would call her back but she says that that never happened. She wrote a letter to Evan and Avi and in there she laid out a number of things that were concerning her on authorized trading, the checking account she had about a million dollars worth of jewelry in a safe deposit box and that her son Bobby had the key to that box and that that jewelry had gone missing. All this was kind of packaged in this you know five page handwritten of Memantor Will and Trust. They're such an evolving narrative about why the jewelry was taken. The only truth we really know is that the jewelry is gone but why it happened there have been a lot of different stories. You just don't take your mother's wonderful things and hand it out and they email that note to JP Morgan to seize all activity on her account. And it ended up setting off a fire storm after that. As soon as they got this email that there was a season to assist and that she wanted to send her money and change brokerage firms they were actually vacationing one floor below downstairs they're there right now. The next day Beverly's in her place a granddaughter still in her place visiting. Dawn is there and up comes Bobby kind of barging through the door and he's screaming about what was sent to the JP Morgan. They're now investigating now and he's furious, takes his mother and sort of puts her into a chair, gets pen and paper and she says physically forced her to write a retraction letter. They were pushing me around. It was a scary time I was really afraid too. I had to take her to the doctor and she did an x-ray because she was in so much pain. The locks had to be changed, the phone number had to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh it was terrible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2856,2022-10-14 16:37:44
14631," How to be changed. I really thought we were going to have to hire guards to be outside just for protection. Oh, it was terrible. Horrible scene. I've probably brought a case before the financial industry regulatory authorities, usually known as FINRA. It took several months' hearings. She sees all sorts of transactions that's going on. Hundreds of them that she claims that she never knew about, never authorized, but yet were logged to JP Morgan's files as having been direct requests from her. That included the sale of a large amount of Apple stock worth several million dollars as well as all her stock in big lots. Over the course of their time with JP Morgan, Evan and Avi were making all sorts of trading on her account that was generating millions of dollars in commissions for themselves in the bank. Yet she was not sort of getting any of the type of gains that you would expect sort of an 80 million dollar account in a bullish market to be able to get. They issued a ruling entirely in her favor finding that her grandsons as well as JP Morgan, they were liable for violating their fiduciary duty, misrepresenting themselves. And they also found that the bank and her grandson, Evan, reliable for elder abuse. Evan and Avi, they were fired from JP Morgan. They issued an award of about 19 million dollars. I reached out for a comment in JP Morgan emphasized that Evan and Avi were no longer with the firm and that their actions do not represent the sort of values of the bank. I reached out to Evan and Avi, heard back from their lawyer saying that they disagree with the law and the facts that FINRA kind of used to decide the case against them and are seeing if they can have it withdrawn. Her son, Bobby, wrote her a letter. Said his sons weren't criminals and he also admits to taking her jewelry and he says he needed it to pay off some bad business debts he had. They never once came up to say I'm sorry. If there had been an apology and some acceptance and asking for forgiveness from my grandmother, I don't think we'd be in the position that we are now. Since the piece came out, we received dozens of messages from people, many of whom are telling their own sort of personal tales of financial advisors gone bad or family members who got control of an estate and abused those within. It seems that it's really resonating with a lot of people who I keep hearing a lot of feedback about Beverly and how a lot of people feel she did the right thing. You're never too old to stand up for yourself and try to write an injustice. She was adamant that she wanted to stand up for herself. At the end of the day, they did wrong. It's a painful life lesson. You know, Beverly taught them that you don't mess with grandma. On April 20th, oil markets did something they never had before and they crashed. They went into negative territory and closed the day at minus $40. Meanwhile, in a place called Thaden Boyce in Essex, a group of nine traders led by a guy called Cuddles made $660 million over the course of a couple of hours. The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning, down more than 35% people.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2857,2022-10-14 16:41:59
14632," The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. People maybe wouldn't have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to zero. But the oil price went to minus 38. It went far lower than anyone had expected. And so lots of people in the market were saying, well hang on, something else is going on here. A couple of months later, I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day. And potentially had some parts to play and what happened. The information we got was that nine traders at Vega Capital London had made in the region of $660 million in one day. As a group, I think they made as much money in one day as Apple makes from its international sales in one day. I mean, it's an insane sum of money. Did they pull off a fantastic trade? Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right? Or was there something else going on and had they actually done something that breached market rules in a bid to push the market? And that investigation is ongoing. So Paul Cummins is a trader who cut his teeth in the pits in the 80s and 90s. When everyone had a nickname, he was Cuddles. If you can imagine that was a very sort of cut throat type of world where people are doing hundreds of thousands and millions of dollar trades by shouting at each other, giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper. The culture of the trading pits in London was very influenced by the working class guys who became traders there. They weren't like the city bankers that had gone before them. They weren't usually Oxford or Cambridge. They didn't wear saddle-roes suits. They were ordinary working guys who happened to have a talent for trading. And a lot of them came from Essex. I think it was 400 traders in the pits and Cuddles in his oil and gas pit was described to us as amongst the top three in amongst that. It was very successful and made very large amounts of money as a young man. But inevitably mechanisation and the arrival of electronic markets was the kind of death knell for the pits. And in 2005 the IPE closed down. And when the pits shut down, a lot of the traders who worked their jobs or quits or went to work for financial institutions, Paul Collins decided to start his own trading collective out in Essex. Some of them are ex-pick guys, cut from the same cloth as him. Lots of them are actually sort of in their twenties and they're, you know, drinking buddies' son or their own kids' friends from football. You know, their young lads, hungry and ambitious and he brings them into the fold. And fairly shortly he's got, you know, maybe a dozen or so traders that are independent. Let's be clear, but they're all part of his collective. Yeah, I'll let Liam do with Essex. I am from Essex, so I feel like I'm free to, you know, to get into this. Sweet as they say. If you were to ask someone in Britain how they would imagine a kind of Essex person, they would see someone who's maybe slightly flamboyant with a sort of cockney accent, a guy which you start accent. You know, not afraid to splash the cash, but it's probably pretty bright and it's done well for themselves. Don't even make sense, does it? But, you know, these guys, they drove around very nice rolls, roises and bent leaves. They went to places like Marbaea on holiday. Thaden Boyce is a very wealthy place. You have to have considerable income to be able to afford to live in that village. It's a really nice place to live and it's 20 minutes to Cheob ride away from the city. Earlier in the summer, we have this lead, which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2858,2022-10-14 16:46:33
14633," Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. Anyone that covers markets is going to be surprised about that. You're thinking your BP's of the world or your Glen Cores but there's this tiny firm. And one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious. We had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together, they played golf together, they would go and holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members of the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging. And it really was this kind of shock that this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts. And it's basically a contract that says I'm going to buy a thousand barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a thousand barrels of oil to you at this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict where the oil is going to go up or down. On the 20th of April in Essex there have been signals for a while that this was going to be an exceptional day in oil markets and we know that some of them arose early and started their trading and the early hours of the morning while it was still dark outside. Essentially what they were doing is buying contracts that gave them an obligation to buy oil at whatever the price ended up at 230 p.m. So they're basically placing a bet that oil was going to fall throughout the day. But they're simultaneously selling lots of oil as well and whether they make a profit and how much profit they make is the difference between what they buy the oil for and what they sell the oil for. Of course we now know throughout April 20th the price dropped and dropped. So this is going very well for them. You know they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices are continuing to fall which means they're going to be able to offset it and buy oil at cheaper at the end of the day. Now once it gets to kind of 130 p.m. that's when things start to get really interesting. Suddenly there's a kind of influx of buyers and sellers you know as desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up. Now at 2.08 p.m. exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened which is the oil passes into negative territory. And it fell to a record level of minus 38 dollars. We've never seen anything like a period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. That huge gulf between what they were buying the oil for and what they were selling it for enabled them to make more money than they ever thought possible. So their profit was the difference between minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus 37 dollars a barrel. For one group of traders operating from a small office it was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this had never happened before in the history of oil trading. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where you enter a trade and you get paid on both sides. You get paid both to sell and to buy. You know it's unthinkable. One thing we know about the cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk. Yeah we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is incredibly risky. And that's actually what stops a lot of oil traders doing trading like this. They simply aren't willing to stomach the risk but cuddles in his friends work. So when the kind of final calculations came down the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2859,2022-10-14 16:50:57
14634," and what? So when the kind of final calculations came down, the group of the nine most profitable traders made $660 million or thereabouts between them. I mean, if you can imagine, I think three or four of them made in excess of 100 million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than $100 million in a single day were in their 20s. One of them was 22 years old. You know, a few years earlier, he'd been posted on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music. And here he is a few years later making $100 million in a single day's trading. When we and Liam discovered that, we just couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. MUSIC All trading is a zero sum game. Anytime you're making money, it's an all trade or someone else is losing it. Amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund, crude oil treasure fund. There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties, they lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q8 or Canada, they sell oil as an average of the WTI closing price over the preceding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in that average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabian Q8 potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of oil they sold that month. MUSIC Vega Capital traders made such an extraordinary sum of money that it was inevitable there would be some scrutiny of what they did. But it wasn't just the sums of money they made in the vital half an hour before the settlement price was set. They were by far the biggest sellers of oil futures in the market, which is an incredible thing to think about. When you consider that the other participants in that oil market are going to be the world's biggest banks, you know, oil majors, BP and Shell. And here you have a group of nine guys in Essex who are having this significant influence over a global market for oil. I mean, I think you have to assume that if these guys have made $7 million or $10 million, they probably would be celebrating in Essex right now. But the fact that they made closer to $700 million has meant that they are facing understandable scrutiny. We wrote individually to all the Vega traders who did exceptionally well that day. And we got a letter in response from a law firm who representing the group. The law firm was at pains to point out, number one, that they haven't been accused of any wrongdoing, that they all traded independently and separately. And they'd basically all made up their own minds that this was what was going to happen in oil markets based on publicly available knowledge and decided to execute this trade. What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day. They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's shocking. But lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge technology driven, funds and firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world. And when you get a bunch of Essex geasers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money, they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. The dream. The dream. The dream. The dream. Since this happened, a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past. Several of them have set up new companies. They've essentially gone very quiet. You know, any kind of social media presence they had has kind of closed down. By all accounts there, you know, waiting this out. It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are going to pan out. You know, we just don't know. There's a number of potential outcomes for these guys. You know, potential punishments if there are any findings of manipulation against Vega or anyone affiliated with it might be, you could be fined, you could be banned from trading, and you know, in most extreme cases, there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlements.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2860,2022-10-14 16:55:20
14635," And in most extreme cases there have even been criminal prosecutions in the past of people who have been found to have been manipulating the settlement and misconduct related to trade settlement. There are other outcomes too. One obvious one is going to be they're able to walk away from this life-changing trade with all the money that they made and celebrated as heroes in the trading community and they'll go down as legends. It's very important given the nature of the climate crisis right now for the general public to have an understanding of what progress is or is not actually happening. And I think many readers right now they'll see these hundreds and hundreds of companies making these big bold climate claims. And they would be forgiven to think that we're well on our way to meeting the emission reduction trajectory. We need to be on. And the reality of the matter is we're just not on that trajectory. And a key reason for this sort of disconnect is the use of offsets that aren't doing what they claim to be doing. We have a massive potential for sort of willful blindness. We can convince ourselves of things regardless of what the facts are. And so that's what tends to happen in these cases. It's not that anybody is setting out to commit climate fraud. They sort of walk themselves into a situation and they convince themselves of one thing and that allows them to convince themselves of another thing. But at the end of the day they're doing something that makes no sense at all. My name is Ben Elgin. I wrote the story about how the billion dollar market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it. One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler. And I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Trexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset, that one of the beauties, so to speak, of greenhouse gases, sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases, you can, when you put up a molecule of CO2 into the atmosphere, it can be anywhere in the planet in seven days. And therefore, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory, for example, then why not pay that person, that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions, then you are in a sense offsetting your emissions. And the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore. So carbon offsets have been around for quite some time. And they were actually key with these international climate agreements. Such as the Kyoto Protocol, which mandated the wealthiest countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The trade was signed on the 11th of December 1997. Decided. The business community, in general, saw carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate trade.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2861,2022-10-14 16:59:20
14636," In general, SAW carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost-effective. We've seen a huge surge in companies making big proclamations about how they're going carbon neutral or zeroing out all of their carbon emissions. We're going to reduce our carbon footprint to net zero. Unilever is committing to net zero emissions. We can achieve a net zero emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of dramatically reduced emissions and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to achieve these aims and as we began to look at the carbon offset projects themselves what we found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they what they seem to be. And as we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits we saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us the nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group they have about a billion dollars a year in revenues and they've been around for seven decades they've preserved about 125 million acres of land and they've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy has taken a different approach a very pragmatic and pro business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter but they're very happy to work with them. Some might say that well that's selling out but others would say and those at the nature conservancy would say these companies have deep pockets they can help fund important preservation work and we have absolutely no problem working with them on this stuff. So companies are very warm and and they've partnered with the nature conservancy for many years and yeah it definitely lends a sheen of credibility to these projects. Here is 20 NERI's in the Disney world this year! If you look at for instance Disney that's a sprawling company with theme parks and cruise lines that burn up diesel fuel they have office buildings and television studios that consume electricity so these companies are trying to make major major reductions in their carbon footprints but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy. One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Riges and that's a plot of land most of the land is actually about a three-hour drive outside of Philadelphia. Interestingly this land 3,000 of these acres was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990s. This land was eminently threatened there was a pending logging contract on this land so they do what they they've done so well for all of these years which is they go out they raise money from local philanthropists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time according to an archive version of the Nature Conservancy's website they when they were proudly announcing this deal they said these threats have been abated because of this acquisition by the nature conservancy. So it's really interesting now fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project and if you look through it this land is a key part of that carbon project and what they're now saying is this land is now once again eminently threatened. 72% of the trees are going to be cut within five years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the nature conservancy they do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2862,2022-10-14 17:03:40
14637," and servency. They do not clear-cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So, this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible. And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits, when it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits, well, that won't be a credible or truthful claim by Disney. So, this is an organization that truly understands the threat of the issue of climate change and is wanting to do its part to address this. However, in this situation, it just appears they're their drive which they've had for decades to increase the amount of revenues that it can use for land preservation work. Nature Conservancy and many others see that carbon credits as a part of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims. But, unfortunately, what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So the Nature Conservancy defends vigorously these deals and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registries set up. So, somewhat also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapid projects to get up and sold. So, we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in this story, including Disney. They didn't want to be interviewed for this story, but they all told us that, look, we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts, they say, are these carbon registries that have been set up. Most of these nature Conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchange, it's called the American Carbon Registry. Now, it's the oldest of these registries that allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold. They've been around since 1996. What these offset registries do is they set up rules and any carbon offset project has to follow those rules. But there's this tension that's always there. If the rules are too strict, then it's going to be very hard for carbon offset projects to get up and running. So, there's this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects, but they don't want it to be so strict where it will disincentivize projects from getting listed. One of the challenges with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers. To some extent, you have policy makers, but the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise, with the incentive to really participate hard, make a lot of things happen. The challenge there is that both of them sort of want the same thing, or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost offsets and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up, though, with nobody really representing the atmosphere, so to speak, nobody's really representing the climate in those discussions. And so the policies end up biasing the whole system and you end up in sort of a race to the bottom. And that's what we've seen happen. When it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets, I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help mitigate climate change. They absolutely can. But if we're not going to do it correctly in a way that actually does help mitigate climate change, then it's nothing but a distraction. And after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate, but that's where we are. Ultimately, what needs to be, what needs to happen is systemic change. We're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. We need systemic.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2863,2022-10-14 17:07:59
14638," We produce energy. We need to change how we transport ourselves. We need to change what and how we eat. You know, we need systemic change associated with transitioning to a low carbon economy. A lot of what we're doing today is not promoting systemic change. It's sort of trying to stick your thumb in the dike to preserve the current system and at the end of the day that can't really work. The Hyperloop. There's a good chance you've heard the name by now. This is the Hyperloop system. It can take people hundreds of miles in minutes. The Hyperloop has a series of tubes that would transport people in pods at ultra high speeds over long distances. It's a remarkable new form of transportation that can whisk people from city to city in a flash. 29 minutes from New York to DC, 30 minutes from LA to San Francisco. For years, we've been seeing these futuristic utopian renderings of some cross between a spaceship and a monorail. But lately, the Hyperloop is becoming much more real. It was surreal to be sitting inside a Hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be riding down a track in something that was nothing more than a crazy idea six years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers at speeds of over 1000 kilometers per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the Hyperloop world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic opportunity. We've got planes, trains, on wheels and boats. We're getting around Earth. But what if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it, which is called the Hyperloop. The Hyperloop? Yeah. In 2013, while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX, entrepreneur Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called Hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A Hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube, usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward. Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pod, the Hyperloop is able to move at incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind Hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2864,2022-10-14 17:12:15
14639," behind Hyperlupis, actually pretty old. In fact, New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870s was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived, however, only stretching one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 miles per hour. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept, and bestow a very 21st century name, he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself, instead electing to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper, literally digging the requisite tunnels by a his boring company. It would take another billionaire industrialist who dabbles in spaceflight. No way, not that one. Yeah, that's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company Hyperlup 1, it would be renamed to Virgin Hyperloop. What we've always been trying to do as a company is show that this technology could work that it could be made safe, and that ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years, not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop. In a familiar tech startup story, he's seen the project go from a garage to a large-scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas. So we started building the first kind of Hyperloop system in 2016. We've done a lot of work, about 500 tests that we've done on that over the last five years. And what we realize that we need to do is take that technology, show that it can be commercial, so drive the cost down, improve the efficiency, improve the performance. But the key thing is, you know, is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that, Josh, along with Virgin's head of passenger experience, Saurolucian, bravely volunteer to take the inaugural ride. What her and I were realizing is like, we're the first two people sitting in a Hyperloop. The only type of people that have gone through this environment are in space. It's in there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system, the safety of what we designed. And then once we started going, you felt a bit of acceleration. We accelerated a little bit harder than we would in commercial. Be like a sports car. We got it to about 108 miles an hour on that test. And it's a short run. It's about 500 yards or so. And came to a stop. The test lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 miles per hour. Is a long way away from a true functioning Hyperloop? But as for optics, it's a crucial step for the future of funding. The number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like, is a Hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology is no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works, but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because it's faster than driving. And most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that Hyperloop could be safe with two normal people, not astronauts, not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that. Two normal people getting on a Hyperloop. And then most of probably those two people getting off. But beyond safety concerns, constructing Hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 million U.S. dollars per kilometer of track. So a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, is likely to come with a price tag over $10 billion. And before large governments are willing to come in in front of those costs, investors who are funding Hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about Hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So this idea that because this smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right? So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century? And that's the part where you're going to get a lot more nose than yeses, but those people that have the ability that afforded to stick it out to see that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2865,2022-10-14 17:16:51
14640," of this century. And that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses, but those people that have the ability that the fortitude to stick it out to see the game-changing platform here, those are the people that we're looking for. And since we've done that passenger test, there has been a lot of interest that's really, oh, this is a lot sooner than I thought. Hasta A Maharaja scar, maiscych aghanracha. Invisioning the ripple effects of what Hyperloop could achieve, those fairly challenging at this stage of development. It's fast, yes, but for point-to-point travel traditional maglev trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai Line in China, for example, loses around $100 million every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name is Alan James, and as far as I know, I'm the only guy on the planet who's written the government-level business case for 300 kmh conventional high-speed rail, 500 kmh maglev and 1000 kmh Hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are, to where they want to go, when they want to make those journeys, and doing it in much smaller numbers. So pod designs for Hyperloop range from 12 to 28 seats typically. Why are they small? It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly. And a great example of that is the East-West strategic route across the north of England, from Liverpool to Manchester to Leeds. So to get from Liverpool via Manchester to Leeds by train is just short of two hours today. It'll probably take you two hours driving as well in average traffic conditions. Let result is those three city regions remain three separate entities. Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop absolutely changes that from the ground up. Liverpool to Manchester is five or six minute journey. Manchester to Leeds is also a five or six minute journey. What that effectively does is create a single super city economy. In this vision, the Hyperloop acts a little more like a highway, where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a Hyperloop network from, say, Liverpool to Leeds, while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that Metro Hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location, you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam, all without making a single stop. For passengers, for business, for leisure, that is utterly transformational. For high-value freight and logistics, it's equally transformational. But critically, if you do a Hyperloop network at scale, you begin to deliver massively significant carbon savings to it. A multi-regional Hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation, both of which are significant carbon producers. One Hyperloop-connected distribution hub, perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight, replacing maybe 10, 12, 15 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck haul.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2866,2022-10-14 17:21:05
14641," 1215 distributed road hubs. It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck orage off the roads. That itself means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperlupes will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Proponents of the technology believe that this can be done by using renewable sources, including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the Hyperloop itself. But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that a Hyperloop network may provide, the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically daunting. Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one. Committing means how do we phase it? One company in the Netherlands is working to develop that technology, and perhaps more importantly, the international coalition needed to make the Hyperloop network a reality. So we are here in Europe's first full-scale hybrid test facility where we can already prove every conceptual technology of the Hyperloop. This is Tim Houter, a co-founder and CEO of Hard Hyperloop, headquartered in the city of Delft. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others, inside is a key technology to create the on and off-ramp type infrastructure of a Hyperloop network, that is a lane switch. That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Then the track is diverged from one track into two. It makes it possible to eventually split up the Hyperloop track in two sections, and in that sense, you can create a complete Hyperloop network that in the end will make it possible to travel for example over a whole continent. I think Europe, for example, with the same ease as you can out travel with a metro in the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we have developed is that there's absolutely zero moving components in the track. So for example, if you have to do a lane switch, all you do is that the tube basically splits up, and statically, the tracks also split up. And whenever the vehicle enters a switch, it either pulls itself to the right with its magnets, or pulls itself to the left with its magnets. Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even modern magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another. And this is a very crucial element, because this is the thing that limits the capacity and in the end, the usefulness of the real network. Because the moment that a track is switching, that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it. So you need a lot of space between trains. Then a Hyperloop, because you have no moving components in the track, all the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency, and basically have vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though, Hart's physical testing has been limited by the size of their tube. Because the test track is only 30 meters long, they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 kilometers per hour. However, the company is working to build a new test site, where it plans to increase that testing speed to 300 kilometers per hour. We're now in a phase where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities that we already have. And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network. If you look at all the top systems that it consists of, most of those are proven systems. We already demonstrated in lab conditions. So we don't really believe that the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all Hyperloop companies out there, actually building a Hyperloop system requires more than just a good product. We're talking about the safety aspects. We're talking about integration into the environment. We're talking about the social aspects to people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2867,2022-10-14 17:25:30
14642," Integration into the environment, we're talking about social aspects, do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system. So it's about all these different aspects and the complexity is really getting all the different stakeholders that are relevant and that they need to contribute to bring this to market to get them all following the same roadmap. In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in Hyperlip development, heart in 2018 partner with other Hyperlip companies from Europe and Canada, the goal was to define, establish and standardize the framework to regulate Hyperlip systems. Right now we are working with all the Hyperlip developers together in setting up the first, let's say, a structure for starting the standards drafting. One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability, which is essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interoperability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up, for example, going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology to get, for example, to answer them. The idea being that as companies around Europe create the first commercial Hyperlip tracks between individual cities, one day those can all be connected to a larger network. Everyone that believes that Hyperlip is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where Hyperlip thrives. Hyperlip is such a huge project, it's definitely not something that you can do in your own or as a single company. So you need to do it with a lot of other companies, you need to have the governments. I think in that sense, the biggest challenge is to really get all the required parties together to take the steps in development and in commercial implementation. Heart's next plan is to build the European Hyperlip Center, an open testing facility which will include a 2.6 kilometer test track. And the company hopes to test travel speeds there at up to 700 kilometers per hour. Virgin Hyperlip is also racing to construct the first commercial Hyperlip route, with projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a Hyperlip certification center in West Virginia, which will include a 6 mile long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if Hyperlip networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea that there's multiple Hyperlip companies, I think is a redeeming aspect in the business. People really want to see something happen, so having multiple people move forward is good for that. I was struck when Josh and Sarah rode the pod. Two or three of the major outlets used the phrase, we now have a new mode of transport. And although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings rode it, it was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube that in popular imagination Hyperlip became a mode of transport. The metaphor I use with my team is that the Wright Brothers refers but none of us fly on Wright Brothers Airlines anymore. If you don't continue to innovate, you're not going to be around and so we'll continue to be at the forefront of building our balloon. Back in 2013, Elon had an idea.

This week, how hydrogen can transform our energy usage. We look at why the universe's most abundant element could be a game changer in the climate revolution. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets. And we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. From iron ore to green hydrogen, one of Australia's richest men tells us about his pivot to sustainable energy. Let's take action. It's practical. It's implementable. Let's do it now. Plus, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian Utilities firm, Snam, about his new book and how green hydrogen could be competitive within five years. Cossera coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors. From Bloomberg's Global Headquarters in New York, I'm Kayleigh Lynez and this is Bloomberg Green. It's a new year, so here at Bloomberg Green we're highlighting new solutions in the fight against climate change. And one of those is as old as the universe itself. Hydrogen. It's the simplest element around, but could well be a game changer when it comes to turning around our dependence on fossil fuels. Today, hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production, and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize. But it has far more uses as well, from powering cars to heating our homes. And Bloomberg New Energy Finance sees a seismic shift in the sector in the next ten years as green hydrogen squeezes out dirtier alternatives. So-called grey hydrogen dominates today. But as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2869,2022-10-14 17:34:08
14644," This so-called gray hydrogen dominates today, but as renewable electricity gets cheaper and more accessible, so we'll green hydrogen. In this week's edition of Bloomberg Green, we'll explore what this push into hydrogen means for tackling climate change. We'll hear from Australian billionaire Twiggy Forest about his pivot from Iron War 2 hydrogen, and we'll also speak with the CEO of Italian utility companies Snam about his book, The Hydrogen Revolution. But first, what are we using hydrogen for? And why does it actually matter? Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen, the most plentiful element in the universe. On Earth, we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water, or in other gases known as hydrocarbons. Hydrogen gas, H2, burns hot and clean, making it an attractive tool in the race to net zero, but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. Today, the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is to use electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct, a lot of electricity is needed. And if this power comes from burning coal or gas, it negates to zero emissions goals of using hydrogen to begin with. Hydrogen produced in this way, powered by fossil fuels, is called grey hydrogen. If carbon capture and storage is used together with fossil fuels, then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power is used, it's called pink. And finally, green hydrogen is what is produced via electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions-free. It's predicted that by the early 2030s, H2 made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. But that hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining, which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing. To be clear, vast amounts of H2 are already used today. Global production in 2018 totaled 117 million metric tons. This hydrogen is mostly used for its chemical properties, not as a source of energy, and very little of it is clean. Some sectors like steel could start using hydrogen for these chemical properties, replacing coal. Industries like cement and glass may also use hydrogen as a source of heat. Another advantage is its energy storage potential. It can be stored over long periods of time, and used when more power needs to be added to the grid. It also could hold an advantage over batteries and heavy transport and shipment. The promise of hydrogen for energy has been around since at least 1874, when Jules Verne wrote about it in his book, The Mysterious Island. But the future of hydrogen will depend on policy. Countries with net zero targets, carbon pricing, and hydrogen strategies with investment mechanisms are likely to see the highest H2 demand. That was Bloomberg's Christine Lee Edwards explaining what hydrogen means for the energy transition. But how are businesses approaching the sector? Well one of Australia's richest men is making a big play into hydrogen. Andrew Forrest, better known as Twiggy, made his fortune from iron ore, being the chairman, former CEO and major shareholder in Fortescue Metals, one of the world's biggest miners. But after having made over $10 billion in profit from the metal in the last fiscal year, Twiggy wants to transform Fortescue into a clean energy company. He's been scouring the planet in search of investment opportunities in hydrogen and renewables. The firm plans to allocate up to 10% of its annual profits for green energy investments and is exploring projects across the globe from Indonesia to Argentina. Prancing Laquah caught up with Twiggy Forest. There's only one type of plant hydrogen, all the rest is dirty. That is green. If you just say green hydrogen is clean, the rest is dirty, then you've actually nailed it. If anyone else who produces any other option, any other act, just look in there and say, why is global warming accelerating, if anything you're saying is true? And then you have no actually, it's green washing. Yeah, but there's a lot of green washing because I keep on being told it's a transition. I can't just make the transition.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2870,2022-10-14 17:38:28
14645," And then you know, actually it's greenwashing. Yeah, but there's a lot of greenwashing because I keep on being told it's a transition. We can't just, you know, make the transition at a click of a finger. So what are we doing wrong? What can we do better? I don't remember the personal computer having to transition the typewriter. I really don't remember that. I don't remember the smartphone having to transition the pocket calculator and the old landline. You know, it's transition line is complete rubbish. The light got put to it. Two days ago when JCB, a really loved British company, every right for the country to be proud of JCB. And Portsky, holding a bit of a similar reputation, fantastic track record. It worked in Superwell from Portsky, huge balance sheet, super strong. When those two companies got together and agreed at 79 billion USD on Greenwood per atom. Right, then that's a real wake up call to say hang on Greenhagen is obviously commercial now. You know, every other form of possible fuel, possible fuel, hydrogen. You know, it can compete with it on price. It can probably lose on price. But what we know, it is cooking the planet. And only Greenhagen zero methane, zero carbon in the supply chain. Don't worry about the molecules in the supply chain. But at the moment, we're not even facing out call if you look at the G20 company case. So we have a long way to go to talk about only using Greenhagen. Yeah, so look, I have a call, which I'd like to make now, that the world should not fund any more carbon-powered power stations, carbon-powered projects. Ever we should wind them down as quickly as possible because they are cooking the planet just like grey and blue hydrogen. It's cooking the planet. You know, hydrogen should not matter when you're going to electricity is releasing 10 to 16 times more carbon. Let mine the methane, which is worse than it is hydrogen. So we've just got to stop doing things which are so farming under the guise of Greenhagen. So why are leaders so slow, even if you look at the appetite for eSG investments, they're growing exponentially. So are emissions. So where are we allocating capital? Okay, so take the recent G20. There's probably a reason why there wasn't strong action coming out of the G20 because people were not aware that major transactions between large companies were taking place now on Greenhagen. Actually, this pollution-free, all the way through the supply chain fuel, has now been transacted at multi-billion dollar scale. If that none that I don't believe any carbon leader or any energy minister or climate change minister could not take ultra-seriously, that Greenhagen is never here to stay. It's broken through. The history has been made. It will never go back. Okay, what is the one thing that you would tell leaders today and business leaders? How do we transition faster than what we are now? Because we're at real risk of missing our targets. So that's really simple. You stop funding, you stop subsidizing, you stop using money into possibly. It could be carbon sequestration, it could be fuel rebates, it could be anything. Hundreds of billions of dollars getting ashed while we ash the planet on fossil fuel subsidies. Because we haven't had that renewable energy, we haven't had that Greenhagen. We've kind of been pushed down, pushed down. It's also some excuses, our never-be commercial, never-be-supplied into quantities we needed. Now we know, let's take action. It's practical, it's implementable. Let's do it now. Okay, if we do it now, is there going to be a shock to the energy system? Is there going to be a shock actually to economically? And is it worth not talking about transition? Just going from A to B? Yeah, it's a fantastic question. A to B is the solution. Let fossil fuels do what fossil fuels do. Just burn their coal, burn their oil, burn the gas. At least they're pumping up carbon and methane into the atmosphere, honestly. Well, not that honest because they don't measure methane, which is 90 times worse than carbon. But at least the carbon has been done honestly. Encourage the Greenhagen sector to come in really fast. It's there. There's renewable power all over the world. We now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2871,2022-10-14 17:42:54
14646," It's a section that's coming really fast. It's there. When you look at power all over the world, we now know how to make electrolyzes much cheaper like 25% of the original cost. We know how to do that now. We don't have an excuse to get into it. Does it need to be cheaper than oil and fossil fuel for it to be viable worldwide? Well, right now it is. So let's just swallow that bit of financial data. Right now it is cheaper and it's getting more check. It's the only fuel you know. Mr. Frosche. Just declining in value. You don't have enough of it. Right. To power the world. Yes, that's only because we haven't had policies to support. We had policies to support it five, ten years ago. It would be everywhere. You'd see the global warming budget start to come down. Now we've got five or ten years to make a huge difference. I need policy leaders all over the world to appreciate. Okay, big business is transacting with green hydrogen in multi-billion dollar agreements. We now know it's here and it's here to stay. It's spread everywhere. Coming up on the program, the hydrogen revolution. We'll speak with the CEO of Italian utility firm Snam about his new book and why he thinks green hydrogen will be competitive in just five years. Plus, how are airlines working to become more sustainable? We'll look at how Airbus plans to step up in the climate fight. This is Blueburg Green. Blueburg Green is a great and important company in the world. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. It's a great company. From Bloomberg's World headquarters in New York, I'm Kayley Lines and this is Blueburg Green. What will the world look like in 2050? Will global temperatures have stabilized? Electric vehicles be abundant? According to Marco Alvera, the CEO of Italian Energy Company Snam, that vision of the future could be a reality. And he says that hydrogen will pay its way. As he tells it in his new book, The Hydrogen Revolution, Alvera's moment of reckoning came in November 2018 when he tasked the Snam scenarios team with studying how Europe could reduce its CO2 emissions to zero by 2050. Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mixed by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the Snam model also predicted that it would...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2872,2022-10-14 17:47:03
14647," Looking through the results of the study, Alvera said he was struck by how much hydrogen was in Europe's energy mix by that year. Beyond the abundance of hydrogen, the STAM model also predicted that it would be the cheapest form of decarbonized energy for many sectors, and that it could be cheaper than today's prices for oil, coal, and nuclear power. Our Maria today is spoke with Alvera at COP26. It's happening all very fast. We see the cost of hydrogen coming down a lot. Hydrogen will play a big role in the energy mix. I don't know if it's going to be 15 or 25 percent of a fully decarbonized energy system, but it's going to be big. Costs are coming down and people are waking up to the fact that it's the only way to decarbonize certain sectors, so-called hard-to-abate sectors. You say it's the only way in the cost are coming down. Where do you see prices moving? Because a lot of the reticence of times has to do with the pricing. That some margueral is still not the cheapest option out of the market. So when I was first working in hydrogen in 2004, it was costing $1,000 per megawatt hour. $2,010,600. Today, 100. And we see it going down to 50 and five years' time and to going down to $25 per megawatt hour in the next 10 years or so. Which is a quarter of word as today. That's really because renewable energy and we're talking green hydrogen here. Renewable energy costs are falling. But the cost of making the electrolyzer, which is the kit that you use to convert solar or wind energy and water into hydrogen, the cost of this kit is falling a lot because it doesn't really exist on an industrial scale. So as we build up capacity, we industrialize it, we standardize it and we squeeze costs out. That's really the cost trajectory. And for that, of course, you need demand, however, for governments and also institutions to kind of buy into this idea that it is a future and we want to invest in creating infrastructure. What are they telling you? When you speak to governments, when you speak to officials, are they keen on this? They're very keen. So the Department of Energy shares our view in the states of getting to below $1.00 kilo, which is $25 a megabit hour. The European Union has a hydrogen strategy, which is very clear and several member states have the same. Chile wants to export a lot of hydrogen. China's big on hydrogen. Australia's very big on hydrogen. Japan is blending already hydrogen. So I would say the world is now really focused on this because it's the only way to store energy for a long period of time economically, to convert it into either a liquid or a gas. And of course, you talk about the price, but the other big component is the volume. How big can you go? Where do you see that on a time scale? So wherever it's sunny or windy, you can produce very cheap hydrogen eventually. And so compared to oil and gas, which are concentrated in a few parts of the world, it's going to be very democratic from that point of view. So every sunny place, every desert, every ocean wind can be turned into hydrogen that we can put on ships and pipes and really start trading it around the world. So it's going to happen a lot faster than a lot of people think. And will you say a lot faster? What is that in time? As they said, $50, which is essentially oil parity within five years. And then depending on how quickly we ramp it up after that, we could get to $25, which is coal parity before the end of the day. And in big scale. In big scale. Because once you get to coal parity, that's the only way we're going to get China and India to stop burning new coal. We have businesses in China and in India. And I see a lot of hydrogen development, a lot of renewable development in both countries. The Indian announcement was incredibly strong on 2030. Some people were upset about the 2017 at zero deadline. But when it comes to 30, he announced a big, big commitment to get the 50 percent of renewables. I was surprised that they would make it so explicit. And even the net zero is a big thing for them. And so I think it will happen faster than 2017 because of the falling costs of renewable and hydrogen. India's burning 80 gigawatt of oil, diesel to keep the lights on. So there's an immediate opportunity there. And we're very interested in working that country. And with regards to China, perhaps the fact that we haven't really seen them active, I guess the diplomats are working on this, but we haven't really seen the leadership. It's going to be technology. It's going to be industry, I think. China has committed to a net zero, which is very important. At the G20, China was clearly behind the one and a half degrees. So I think a lot has been achieved between the G20 and COP. And I think what's really important is to see in the coming years, how quick it's in our hands to make part of this happen in five years or could otherwise happen in 15, 20 years. It's about building the project. The capital is there. We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. This missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2873,2022-10-14 17:52:04
14648," We saw how many trillions of dollars are already committed. What's missing is really the projects and that's where companies like us step in. Marco Alvera, CEO of Snam there speaking with our Maria Tadeo. Let's turn now to the aviation industry. It's a big contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and it's under pressure to change that. In October, the International Air Transport Association, a tree body representing airlines, approved a target of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To achieve that, many airlines in the US and Europe are looking to buy sustainable aviation fuel made from renewable sources like used vegetable oil. Initiatives like these are pushing plane makers to come up with some radical new aircraft that will eventually cater to our growing appetite for travel without hurting the environment. We took a look at how Airbus, the world's number two aircraft manufacturer is stepping up to the challenge. How long until we can fly emission free? Airbus says it's more confident by the day, it can be done by its 2035 target. Airbus a CEO spoke about its ambitions for hydrogen-powered planes at the company's summit in France. The physics works. Hydrogen technologies are not new. They are used in other sectors. We use them in space on our rockets and we don't need the laws of physics to change to be able to use hydrogen on our planes. So every day we become more confident, but we think we need to have a plane. We need to have the right fuels, the hydrogen available in the right quantity at the right place at the right time and we need the regulations to be ready. So we really need the work and the collaboration of many people on the globe to make it happen on time. But it could be a long wait until green passenger jets go mainstream. Larger aircraft with more than 150 seats are not expected to feature globally until about 2050. That means manufacturers and airlines today are under growing pressure to ramp up short-term innovations to cut their carbon. In a long term, meeting the ambitious plans for so-called green hydrogen means building a giant industry almost from scratch. To make that happen, British airline EasyJet is among those saying governments need to get involved and fast. Aviation submissions over the last three decades leading up to the pandemic grew by about 80% to over 1 gigaton, and that's projected to double by 2050. According to Bloomberg, any F, about half of the airlines with the largest global market share have set net zero targets by that same date nearly three decades away. Coming up from Blue Sky Projects to the bottom line, we'll speak with our Bloomberg NEF expert Meredith Annex and dig into their models about how hydrogen fits into the future energy mix. This is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2874,2022-10-14 17:55:45
14649," ja From Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, I'm Kaby Lines, and this is Bloomberg Green. Now let's bring in Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg N.E.F. Hydrogen Specialist to talk more about how hydrogen could change the energy landscape. Meredith, what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen is this incredible solution for us as we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution in areas that are hard to electrify. So we're really like to think about hydrogen playing a role. It's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feedstock, as well as energy source, and in things like dispatchable power, long-called transport, maybe even shipping and aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day, though, how much is this going to cost? Well, that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because depending on how you make it, it can actually see significant cost of clients in the future. So when we're talking about clean hydrogen, we usually mean green hydrogen produced for renewable electricity. And in that case, your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it. So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources, you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen. But even in places with less good resources, we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram, which is the price of unabated hydrogen today, and around $8 per million BTUs for those who prefer to think in energy units. And that can be achieved anywhere in the world by 2050, we believe. All right. So let's talk about kind of the pros and cons list. I don't know where cost fits into that, but what are the advantages to hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah. Main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve roles that electron struggle with. And that's things like seasonal storage, for instance, or just anything where you need to store ability, where your electrons are harder to store, hydrogen is going to be easier. That also leads to a downside, though, because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy. Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So for green hydrogen again, from renewable electricity, really places with the best renewable resources, things like Latin America or the Middle East, even southern Europe have really really good potential for producing hydrogen. And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon-caption storage, we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future, especially as renewable electricity costs come down. But that can be a viable option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia, where you've got good geological storage for the carbon, as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. All right. Great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex, our Bloomberg NEF Hydrogen Specialist. And of course, you can get more from the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online. And they've recently done a podcast called Hydrogen 101 as part of its switched on series. So from iron ore titans pivoting to cleaner energy to talk of a hydrogen revolution, that's it from this week's edition of Bloomberg Green. We'll be back next week with a deep dive into the state of electric vehicles. And you can keep the conversation going by following us on YouTube, Instagram and Twitter at climate. I'm Kiley Lines from Bloomberg's World Headquarters in New York, and this is Bloomberg Green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2875,2022-10-14 18:00:07
14650," York and this is Libre Green. The price in the 60s. I simply said there is several bench meant to say is that there are several bench marks that are relevant in deciding what a price should be. One question is what is the marginal cost for Russia of producing oil? And so there will certainly to charge a price less than that would certainly cause Russia to want to shut in oil. They don't want to sell oil at a loss. So that's one bench mark for discussion. Another bench mark is let's look at history and see what prices has Russia earned in the past and found acceptable and profitable to produce and sell oil. One thing we want to be clear about is that Russia should not profit from having started this atrocious war in Ukraine and shouldn't be benefiting from profits that result from those atrocities. So we're looking historically at what have oil prices been that Russia has earned and it was in that context that I mentioned a specific number or range. But no decision has been made and I did not say that that's what the prices that's under contemplation. No decision has been made. Thank you, Secretary Allen. You mentioned meeting with the African finance ministers. It's our understanding that a lot of them have been asking about an additional allocation of special drawing rights. Do they bring that up to you and what's your response if they did? That's our understanding that Treasury is not really seriously entertaining that. You have addressed the fiscal space considerations here and sort of why not if that's what potential means to address that. Thank you. So I mean an SDR allocation is intended to address shortages of global liquidity. We had a substantial SDR allocation and we do not see another SDR allocation as appropriate at this time. It was decided by the G20 that it would be appropriate for countries that received SDR allocations and didn't really need the liquidity to consider lending some of those SDRs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2876,2022-10-14 18:04:36
14651," We are allocations and didn't really need the liquidity to consider lending some of those SDRs or other resources back to the IMF for use in lending in structured ways to countries with need. One fund is the poverty reduction in growth fund that can provide assistance to low-income countries. The IMF has also created a resilience and sustainability trust that can lend for things like investments in health to address, prepare for future pandemics or strengthen health systems as well as energy security and to address climate change. We think that's an appropriate way to address some of the issues that low-income countries face. We have asked Congress to allow us to lend 21 billion dollars to the IMF for these two funds. We haven't yet received approval but are hoping that that's something that will be allowed to do and other countries will as well. But we've certainly worked with the World Bank and with dedicated food organizations like IFAD and Gafsby to add to their resources to be able to address food insecurity. The IMF has resources to lend to countries with difficulties. We've talked about debt restructuring where that's necessary and all those things are tools we have to address needs of low-income countries we want to mobilize but in SDR allocation isn't what we're contemplating. Good afternoon, Secretary Yellen. Very recently based on analysis of productivity growth in the U.S. and labor force participation gains both of which are quite disappointing. The staff at the Federal Reserve significantly downgraded their estimates for the level of potential output in the U.S. economy. In fact, projected that over the next few years all the way through 2025 actual output would exceed potential output which boasts rather poorly for the fight against inflation. Wondering first, does this perhaps help explain the surprising persistency of high inflation in the U.S. and number two would it make the fight against inflation to bring inflation back down to around 2 percent much more difficult than many currently assume it will be. Thank you. So I must say I haven't was this in the minutes or so I mean I haven't seen the details of that I didn't review the minutes carefully but a manifestation of that is that labor markets are very tight and to say that labor markets are extremely tight is another way of saying that the economy that output is at or above its potential. We've been looking and hoping that labor force participation would fully rebound from the pandemic and it's rebounded to some extent but it hasn't fully rebounded and that's a factor that does tend to depress potential output. So I think we've seen some meaningful reduction in the amount of pressure in the labor market. The most recent Jolts report shows that job openings are coming down and that can take some of the heat out of the labor market that may be contributing to high rates of core inflation.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2877,2022-10-14 18:08:29
14652," And that can take some of the heat out of the labor market that may be contributing to high rates of core inflation. But yes, the labor market is very tight, and it's a manifestation in part of what you're talking about. But look, the Federal Reserve is obviously very committed to doing what it takes to bring inflation down. And as I said, the administration is trying to complement that through targeted measures like lower prescription, drug costs, lower premiums for affordable care. We're interventions to hold down, whether it's the strategic petroleum reserve or the price cap on Russian oil to hold down energy prices in the United States. But the Fed will leave it up to the Fed to take the primary role here. Thanks, guys. Thank you. I want to put things. No, we got to go to the title. All right, everybody. You've been listening to Janet Yellen, the US Treasury Secretary, former Fed chief, as you know, there in Washington at an IMF meeting. And there's been a lot of leaders, if you will. Couple of meetings going on in Washington. So we've been hearing from world leaders really talking about some of the global macro issues. Among some of the headlines from Janet Yellen noting about the US Federal Reserve very committed to bringing down inflation. She touched on labor force participation, saying it has not fully rebounded. And she also did talk about Russia getting into oil and other issues should not profit from its war on Ukraine. So some of the big issues out there. She also said Russia should not profit, as you mentioned. And no decision has been made yet on Russian oil price cap level, though she's attended to spillovers from policy tightening. She also reiterated support for market determined exchange rates. And Carol, she said the Fed is very committed to bringing down inflation. Absolutely. I don't know if you've heard that for anyone else. It's worth the two of us saying it, because it's important. No, it's like it's been the drumbeat, if you will, this week. But also talking about spillover. And we have to think about all of these actions have a global impact. Having said that, we are seeing our US markets lower today. Welcome, everybody. Live from the Bloomberg Interactive Brokers Studio. We are streaming on YouTube. Carol Master along with Tim Stenevich a lot ahead. But first up, let's get you update on the markets. Let's get a Bloomberg business news flash from Charlie. Thank you very much. Carol Master all about inflation again on this Friday with the Dow, the S&P and Nasdaq bouncing along the bottom. Stocks fell after a report showed year ahead inflation expectations rose for the first time in seven months. The S&P now down 66 drop right now of 1.8%. The Dow is down 290 down 1%. Nasdaq is slumping 247, a drop there of 2.3%. The 10-year yield 4.01%. The two-year yield 4.50%. Spot gold down $22, the ounce to 1644. A drop of 1.3% West Texas, Inavidia Crude down 3.7%. 85 78 a barrel. So a down day on Wall Street, the Dow, the S&P, all in the red. Briefly, we've got lots of bank earnings today. JP Morgan Chase of 2.2%. City Group up 1.2%. Wells Fargo up 2.9%. And that's a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. Carol Master Tim's Denivic a lot coming up. We're going to talk about the big bank earnings today. That is certainly a focal point today, Tim. Yeah, we got some great guests on National Ibasic. He's going to be joining us in just a second. The broader equity trend, we're going to continue to talk about that. We got Jess Metin with us in Vince Signorella. He's going to join us on that. And also, why we need to pay attention to the political turmoil in the UK. We like guys on the morning call, come on. We got to do something on the UK. Yeah, this was my call. I was like, we got to do something here. You win. You win. I won this one. All right, plus Bloomberg breaking the news yesterday. Now it's official, Kroger buying Albertsons. We'll get into that. And we're going to talk about Exxon's text toxic culture. But right now, let's talk about the markets. We got Jess Metin, an equities reporter for Bloomberg News with us. Vince Signorella is global macro strategist for Bloomberg News. He joins us on the phone from White Plains. Jess, I want to start with you. Take us into the details of today's trade. Well, today, I mean, things started off at the open a little bit higher. But then quickly reverse once we did get that University of Michigan data that showed one year out those inflation expectations from consumers were inching higher. And so that obviously goes on the back of one week.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2878,2022-10-14 18:13:29
14653," But then quickly reverse once we did get that University of Michigan data that showed one year out those inflation expectations from consumers were inching higher. And so that obviously goes on the back of when we got the CPI data yesterday, that was clearly hotter than expected. And a lot of people at some points was a head scratcher for some yesterday when they were wondering what was going on there. When I was talking to traders, a lot of what they were pointing to was short covering positioning. I was looking at a Goldman Sachs basket of the 50 most shorted stocks leading up to Thursday as well as what was happening yesterday and today and that had at various points continued to outperform the S&P 500. So you could see that there was a lot of short covering happening. So when I knew rally, everybody was going to be right a lot of what happened either leading up to Thursday. So many investors got burned whenever we got the August inflation data on September 13th. They were on the wrong side of that trade. And some of them were positioning for whether what kind of turbulence could come. And a lot of that was attributed to the balance that we saw yesterday. Vince Norella is also with us. Of course, Global MacroStrad just at Bloomberg News on the phone from White Plains, New York. I mean, crazy day yesterday. There's lots of writings about it. Vince, you were sending us messages. And then of course, we've got a down day today. So what are your thoughts on the trade that we're seeing? The trade that we're seeing now is basically on the consumer sentiment survey that the inflation expectations for one year, quite everyone by surprise. I think more people do not work expecting that to either match estimates. Not be below estimates. And that was similar expectations for yesterday's CPI actually. Lloyd Blindfine had a great tweet. He said, if you got the data ahead of time yesterday, you would have lost the fortune. Which is totally true because you would have been positioned the wrong way if you didn't take your profits very quickly. We're seeing the tough level at 3600 right now playing out in the S&P 500. It's a two-standard deviation move from the 12-month average closing price. It does trade through those levels. But if it continues to trade through and keep coming back above, it could give a nice floor for bulls to hold on to going into next week. So you're saying if we hold above 3600 on the S&P 500, that would be significant? Yeah, I mean, I don't mind very much if it trades below it. It just needs to come back above it and just keep creating this up and down movement and show that it's able to over time hold the level. But we don't have a lot of exciting data next week to really move markets. Some home sale data is the primary one. We already know home sales think, so I don't know how much that's going to accept the market. 7% mortgage rates yesterday. So, yeah, I mean, the real data is soft. Despite what the Antimons says. Yeah, go ahead. Well, I was just going to say Vince, we're at 3598 on the S&P right now. We're just at 3599. So right there. Hey, hey, Jess, and by the way, Vince, I think we had enough exciting data this week because you know, there was there was enough, you know, I'm ready for a little bit of a breather. Hey, Jess, on a technical level, what are you watching and what are the technical analysts that you've been talking to watching? Well, technicals were a key yesterday as well. So at one point, the index for the S&P 500 had given back about 50% of its post pandemic rallies. So when we're talking about the March 2020 lows to the January highs of this year. And that also triggered some program buying. And that was a key threshold. 50% of its post pandemic rally. That's cream cheese. Some context there. And where the S&P 500 was sitting in February of 2020 before we saw the crash that ended up happening in that March, it was right below 3400, just to give some context as far as basically the move we've seen this year undoing the rally from the pandemic. Wow, I didn't know we were that close to, I mean, I've seen so many companies being that close to being back to what they were before the pandemic. But I mean, and the NASDAQ to, you know, back to levels last summer of 2020. And so in some ways, this could be a bullish scenario for a short term bounce. We are in a seasonally strong time period of the year. And sentiment has been so extremely bearish that that has come into factor there. Right. But close to being, if you look at something like RSI, like Christa being oversold, we were recently back in September. We were. And then coming into that. So when I talked to Gina Martin Adams and her team at Bloomberg Intelligence, they were pointing to that extreme measures. But they still think that when they're looking at their forward 12 months outlook for the S&P 500, they still don't see us back even in the most bullish scenario at the January highs a year from now. Vince, you still think the Fed is overdoing it at this point and needs to stop. Oh, yeah.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2879,2022-10-14 18:17:49
14654," bullish scenario at the January high a year from now. Vince, you still think the Fed is overdoing it at this point and needs to stop. Oh, yeah. No doubt that I was looking at something that won't have a chance to write up this week. But when you look at year over year change of M2, disposable personal savings as a percentage is disposable income, I close the charts, I have to try to remember this. And such, you basically think that really tapped out consumer. And overrevolving credit the other on a year over year basis is true. So, you know, consumers, the savings isn't there, the wages aren't there. They're spending on credit cards, they're maintaining balances on credit cards, which is the most horrible thing you could do. And I just wonder how much longer that's going to last and why the Fed just won't let what they've done so far play out. They're so afraid of losing credibility that I can be going to end up losing credibility by making the same mistake they did during the pandemic by continuing to say transitory. And, you know, monetary policy takes six to 18 months to work its way through the system. They're so impatient to try to get this back down to 2% in a heartbeat. It's just not going to happen. And they're going to send us right into a recession, which could potentially be stagnationary if they're not careful, which is exactly what they're trying to avoid. You know, I'm already in a dark mood. Could anybody give me something good to think about? So actually Bank of America put out a note this morning as Savita Super AMian. And she was saying that for longer term investors over the next 10 years, their outlook as far as the average returns for the S&P 500, they'd be around 6%. It's a little bit below the north for 10 years. They have fans and we have including dividends of be around 8%. But they still were noting that in the short term, still going to be a bumpy ride for investors. And they have this batch of how they're trying to get for the next decade. And so as far as just the short term, they still think there's going to be a lot of volunteers. That sounds pretty good if we're not at 8% inflation. You buy into any kind of forecast for 10 years just real quickly. I think actually next year's going to be a very good year. I think the feds are going to push us over the edge. I think I'm going to take a deep dive from into a recession, not necessarily a risk so off of its ordinary measures. And I think the fed pauses to reverse is dramatically risk on since it's good enough. All right, we're going to leave it on that now. Okay. I need some optimism. All right, guys, thank you so much.

Check them out at SQUA Go on your launch pad on the Bloomberg and just met and thank you, equities reporter here at Bloomberg News. Let's get on over to Charlie Pellet for an update on what's going on with the markets because we're seeing a leg lower chart. Indeed, not going to make Carol happy. We've got the down the S&P Nez Stack all in the red lows of the day right now on the S&P. Bring on the weekend. We've got the S&P down 77 down 2.1% the Dow down 383. It declined right now of 1.3%. Nez Stack composite index down 285. A drop there of 2.7%. Familiar theme stocks fell after a report showed US year ahead inflation expectations rose for the first time in seven months.

We did get earnings from banks this morning. Briefly, JPM, JPMorgan Chase up 2.2%. City group up 1% Wells Fargo up 2.8% and Morgan Stanley down 5.5%. That is a Bloomberg business flash.

She's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. Working the long shift is she does kind of more than quarterly, I'd say, when it is time for bank earnings. She'll just. She'll just.

14655," men is looking at headcount. And the reason being is Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, they've bought companies in recent years, which means their headcount has increased profitability is under pressure as investment banking is severely under pressure. Trading is also under pressure in many ways. And so, a banker just called me and he just kind of made a joke and he was like, listen, they could hire more people, but they're getting fruit cake for bonuses. Wow. So that, what a difference a year or a year and a half makes. That's not a last one. Wow. So even if the headcount goes up, you do know there will still be cuts across the banks and he didn't go that far to say so, but he said there can be efficiencies, which tends to be a proxy for, will make some. And you know, is it 5% the typical calling that a lot of the banks do? This is pre-COVID behavior. It gets way more concerning when they start to go much, much further than that if they do. How does all this watch? A couple things inside baseball, right? You want to watch Goldman Sachs's equity trading figure. Morgan Stanley maintained their lead can Goldman punch above their weight here because people expect Goldman and JP Morgan to take more share in that business. And then also, a fixed income trading can it hold up, can it help save the day when some other businesses are under pressure. Goldman last quarter bought in a billion dollars of advisory revenue, even with this tough market. So, can Goldman Sachs do what Goldman Sachs does and still make money? They've been very surprising and they've been able to rake in real dollars. But the market has not loved them for it. Net, 10, 15 seconds. Net net, we just managed by the banks. So, that's why we're excited. Or was it actually a pretty good quarter? It was a decent quarter. It's too early to get excited when we're getting into this kind of a macro backdrop. All right, interesting. But we do know that they've been under pressure in a low rate environment. So, yeah. Okay, Shinoli, thank you so much. Long day, but great analysis as always.

Geethe Kobanath is first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund. I think there is a clear recognition that inflation is stubborn, it's persistently high. And I do think central banks are very careful not to get stumbled on the fact that maybe this is all going to move correct itself automatically. So I think there is very much agreement on staying the course. And those IMF meetings in Washington will run through Sunday. Two supermarket chains heading down the merger aisle. 8% right now, Albertans lower by 7.4%. All right Charlie, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The real point from a global perspective is the reason the market revolts against unfunded tax cuts became as extreme as it was. That was because there were effectively hidden exposures to people who had bet on rates to stay low in the UK pension market. There are some very serious questions about British regulation of pensions, but the fact remains that if interest rates are kept at zero for over a decade and you are trying to account some kind of returns to pay pensions to your members, you are effectively being encouraged to take a bit more risk. And contemporary derivative contracts make it easy for you to do that in a way that's effectively leveraged without saying so much. Britain because of the year, really I have zero.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2883,2022-10-14 18:38:09
14658," leverage without saying so much. Now, Britain, because of the, you know, really, I have zero sympathy for quite, I mean, that was a, I cannot think of any worse unforced error any finance ministers made in my career than that. I don't have any great sympathy for him, because Britain did make that mistake that there was that the, we did light the blue touch paper and get people to really question, uh, guilt and start the selling. Britain has gone, come first that we, we're seeing that that being tested in Britain first, but, um, I think it's an open secret that probably are accidents like that waiting to happen in every other developed financialized economy. And that's why the headline on the big take that the case for a pivot, the case for not continuing to raise rates and fight inflation, I think, rests on the fear that you could create a real financial implosion. If you, if we pivot, it won't be for reasons of the macroeconomy, inflation is still not looking critical, it would be about the risk of a much broader accident along the lines of what's happened in Britain. I mean, if you think about right, um, the kind of the scary cycle and almost predicament that global central banks find themselves and they had to do what they had to do coming off the pandemic, right, to help the economy. But yes, it did make a lot of money sloshing out or a lot of liquidity sloshing around, did encourage people to take risk to kind of get things moving again. And now that they're taking that off, it puts those positions at risk like how the heck do you get out of this in a clean way and forgive me because we could talk to you for hours on this situation. It's such the big story of a time, but we have about a minute. What's the key takeaway here? What's the key takeaway? Um, if the key takeaway for Britain is that the overwhelming likelihood is that within a few months, there will be another new prime minister and that's probably going to have another labor government within the next two years. Um, for the, for the markets, there are reasons why people are worried. Um, and there are reasons for central banks to proceed with caution. Uh, but I think it was, um, I think it was Jamie Dimon said if you need earlier this week, if you need to raise funding, go do it. Yeah. This is a good time to get your house really seriously in order because it's probably going to come under more pressure. Yeah, I would say a lot of CFOs that companies are talking a lot with their CEOs about kind of what the, the era to come in the next couple of quarters or so. John authors, thank you so much.

Hey, Tim, President Biden meeting virtually with the prime minister of India today. He'll again make it clear the US does not want to see a surge on energy imports from Russia. India has bought at least 13 million barrels of Russian crude oil since troops invaded Ukraine seven weeks ago. Ahead of midterms, Republican leaders are describing out of control border security. Democrats are highlighting progress working with Mexico on big issues like drugs, crime and irregular migration. After new security talks in Washington alongside Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Mexican diplomats, US Attorney General Merrick Garland described improved relations. Our agents and prosecutors are working to dismantle the dangerous cartels that bring deadly fentanyl into our communities in both countries. US Attorney General Merrick Garland and Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane who played the half-giant Hegrid in the Harry Potter movies has died. He was 72 years old.

Global news, 24 hours a day, on air and on Bloomberg Quick Take powered by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Ann Mosque, this is Bloomberg. All right, Ann, thank you so much. You are listening to Bloomberg Business. We Carol Master along with Tim Stenevek. And we did want to mention a story that is on the Bloomberg terminal. It has to do with Russian President Vladimir Putin and saying that he has no regrets about his struggling invasion of Ukraine and left open the possibility of renewed massive abordment of cities there. We did see an escalation this week. Yeah, we certainly did, Carol. And a lot of questions as to what a potential off ramp would look like for Vladimir Putin. It's something that we talked about earlier this week. When we had many guests joining us to think about how this looks like it could end. Yeah, I mean, it's safe to say that when it all kicked off earlier this year, we thought it would be rather quick, but we thought it would be rather quick because Russia would win. Correct. That's what everybody was saying at the time. And that obviously has not been how it played out. Although they have been able to take control of some territories, but nonetheless, I guess what's going on, at least according to our reporting, is that the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, sought to reassure Russians, alarmed by his order last month to call up 300,000 reservists for the fight saying that the process will wrap up in a couple of weeks and won't be extended, which is interesting because you did hear stories about Russian men like getting out of the country because they didn't want to be called back. Or even breaking their own bones so they wouldn't have to get called up. After unleashing the biggest barrage of missile strikes on Ukrainian cities this week since the early days of the war, the Russian leader said no further such massive strikes are needed, quote, for now. He made no mention of the string of battlefield setbacks that his army has faced at the hands of Ukrainian troops in recent weeks. He was asked to about a possible meeting with US President Joe Biden at next month's group of 20 summit, Putin saying, here's a quote, we should ask him if he's ready to hold such talks with me or not. I don't see the need to be honest. He added that his participation in the summit in Indonesia is not yet decided. Putin also said he's not ready to take up mediation offers by Turkey and the United Emirates, claiming Kiev isn't ready for peace talks. All right. So, you know, when we talk about macro issues, folks, you know them all, certainly the global inflationary fight moves by global central bankers, geopolitical tensions, whether it's US and China, China and Taiwan, Russia and Ukraine, Russia and rest of the world. I mean, the energy changes. It's a lot, but we can't forget that this is going on. It's interesting to me, Carol, that we're at a point where we've seen tensions with the nuclear power probably bigger than we've seen since the Cuban missile crisis, and that's not more of a conversation. Not just when it comes to global markets, but the world order. Yeah, no, right, to see that some of the conversations or fears or concerns that are going on because of that specifically. All of this happening on a day when we're seeing, once again, US stocks selling off their hovering near their lows down more than 2% on the S&P 500, almost 2.7% lower on the NAS deck.

In the new issue of Bloomberg Business Week magazine just out, it's a Bloomberg exclusive about Exxon's toxic culture and how it's driving away workers who once coveted a career at the oil giant. The story by Kevin Crowley, US oil reporter for Bloomberg News. He joins us this afternoon on the phone from Houston. It's a 140 year old oil company and it's making more money than ever yet the pandemic exposed deep cultural problems and talent is fleeing. We've also got your web.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2886,2022-10-14 18:52:15
14661," Houston. It's a 140 year old oil company and it's making more money than ever yet the pandemic exposed deep cultural problems and Talent is fleeing. We've also got Joe Weber with us the editor of Bloomberg Business week. He's with us right now in the Bloomberg Interactive broker studio Joel when we think about a 140 year old company How could not that many of those there aren't that many of those that's true especially ones that were born after you know standard oils You know being dissolved What is the who is the type of person who goes and works at axon? Well as Kevin writes, you know, it's not maybe the you know kind of white-colored talent that you might kind of think of it at like a company that's been around for a really really long time but you know Exxon is built on engineers really and and that and science and and this is like a place where One of the few remaining companies really in America where a job is really for years, right if not life But what Kevin was able to report is that Not only has there been The success but within Exxon there has been sort of a hollowing and to be fair a lot of companies have had this during the pandemic right? We've seen Attrition be something that is we talk about it all the time But there's a difference with Exxon which as Kevin writes It's almost like the culture has been trapped in this amber So so Kevin you spoke to more than 40 people for this article. It was a major feat of reporting Not an easy story to get and I'm curious. What did you learn along the way? Yes, really as you said it means started out really like as just another Just not a great resignation story But really once once so once I really started to speak to people and dig in there was there was really one common reason why people were quitting and that was this toxic culture people People that were scared to speak against their bosses. They didn't feel comfortable speaking freely about climate change or Promoting Rating diversity. There was there. There was a real lack of of exchange of free ideas lack of innovation And and there was also a fear of being dropped in the companies zero some Performance ranking system a system that was actually amped up to make even more competitive In the midst of the in the midst of the pandemic. So what really changed was that You know Exxon was was was as you said very much one of America's last job for life corporations They used to promise you used to take care of you as a graduate all the way through to retirement So long as you were loyal so long as you work hard That will change during the pandemic because They decided they were going to cut people and they cut they cut people through layoffs They cut the base grease the performance evaluation system and everything just became a lot more kind of Abt up and over the last two years really 21 22 we've seen huge amounts of employees leaving this time of their own Inflation okay, so there's the metaphor in the story that we got to talk about here at Kevin which is Rex's tree Rex being Rex Tillerson who is the the the prior CEO At that time the the company was was doing great it had made 45 billion dollars in a single year the biggest profit of any company in US history at the time And this was in in O6 the company built a whole new compound And put a tree moved a hundred foot Oak tree that was meant to be sort of like the the you know, peace day resistance of what could be on this campus and What happened from there? So they move the Move the tree it's a huge feat of engineering to dig up the root system 100 foot oak tree to move it into into the middle of campus And it was it was really a remarkable feat to even had its own custom built irrigation system um to keep it to keep it alive after the move and Basically over the years The the canopy fin it lost leaves it lost branches it got hit by lightning at least once Um, and it really it really started it really started to look um For for where the employees started to joke it was a bit like the the giving tree And it shall seal it so the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2887,2022-10-14 18:55:47
14662," It really started to look worse for a wet. Employees started to joke. It was a bit like the giving tree. The shelf was being booked. And eventually over Memorial Day 2021, the campus operas removed the entire tree. And a memo went out in the morning saying that despite its out with appearance, it was dying inside. So take this to the company, right? Because that tree was supposed to be a symbol, if you will, or I think as you write, the company's reverence for the surrounding landscape and the environment. We see big oil companies thinking about life after fossil fuels. And this was, I guess, supposed to kind of indicate, too, Exxon thinking about what's next. And yet, it's not been the case inside, has it? So this is the biggest issue facing Exxon at the moment, is the energy transition. Look, oil prices are surging up at $90 a barrel. Exxon made more money than it ever did before last quarter. This year on track to make more money than Amazon, Tesla, Proctor and Gamble combined. However, long-term, there is an energy transition underway. We just passed the biggest climate bill here in the US. Europe is moving much faster towards clean energy features, results of what's going on with Russia. And this is a huge challenge for Exxon. And it's going to require, and so an employees really feel this. Employees want Exxon to push harder. Employees want them to be on the cutting edge of new technologies, which they really haven't been. And employees expect them as an industry leader to be able to build that clean energy future. And this is coming from the bottom. And the big challenge really is that Exxon is to dominate the next century as it is the last century. It's going to have to work out how does it attract and retain the best and the brightest engineers and technologists of the new generations, and the Gen Z even millennials. They work very differently than they did in the past. And they care about things like diversity. They care about things like climate change. And the company really needs to respond to that. So I think there's some important conversations to be hit to be had. You know, Exxon is going to succeed in this time of change ahead of it. Kevin, we only have 20 seconds left. But what is one thing that they're doing right now to try to adapt to that, to try to attract that talent? They are having important conversations within the company. I know this because there was an issue with there with banning the rainbow flag earlier this year. And I have learned that they have had important conversations to see your leadership and employees. So I think they're moving. Well, grab a cup of coffee, glass of wine, read the story. It's in a firety. Go with the wine. It's in the new issue of Bloomberg Business. We Kevin Crowley, thanks. Jill Weber, our thanks to you as well. This is Bloomberg Radio.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2888,2022-10-14 19:00:08
14663, Ann хватientin to come down across platform coverage ahead of the US market closed starts right now. This is countdown to the close. We have about 60 minutes left in your trading session Caroline Hyde remain Bostic Taylor Riggs. We join our biocollies Carol Maser and Tim Stenevich as always we go across our audiences TV radio YouTube some breaking news though now remain. Interesting heads crossing the wire this one at Lanna Fed president Rafael Bostic revealing that apparently he had trades financial trades during the blackout period that fed members are beholden to he says that those trades were inadvertent now this is coming from disclosure forms that were recently updated just to reiterate here. Rafael Bostic the head of the Atlanta Fed is said that he was made aware of specific trades and timings of transactions that should not have been done at the time that they were done he is saying that he himself did not make those transactions it was a third party that did it on his behalf but the real issue here is why that was not disclosed before it is now being disclosed and of course guys this goes back into the broader issue that we talked about just a few months ago when it came to Richard Clarita when it came to Eric Rosengren and of course to Kaplan as well this idea of what these Fed members are doing with their own financial balance sheets at a time when they should have their eye on the nation's balance sheet. And of course you're getting in reaction to all of that Fed Chair Jay Paul has testified about this he's talked about the Fed issuing up its own rules to really look at and examine the way that these trading is done you've even had Senator Elizabeth Warren be full out in front of this as well I'm asking for much more disclosure about this and yet it looks like of course more still needs to be done really please to say that we can bring in our very own Mike McKee joining us now and Mike again what do you make of the significance of these headlines? Well Taylor the Atlanta Fed president says he discovered the itter call it illegitimate trading at this point we don't know if it was illegal and amended seven years of his financial disclosure forms told the Atlanta Fed board about it told the board of the federal reserve about it and says it's third-party problem when he came to the Fed he decided to let a third-party handle his investments so that he would be at arms length but as you see there in his letter he said he was unaware of the trades during the blackout periods but unaware and unaware of his holdings of treasury funds exceeding Fed limits and so he's as I said he has redone his financial disclosure forms basically what it comes down to is Boston omitted securities,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2889,2022-10-14 19:05:00
14664," limits. And so he's as I said, he has redone his financial disclosure forms. Basically, when it comes down to his bostech omitted securities transactions that were made on his behalf from his disclosure forms, he held more than $50,000 worth of treasury funds violating Fed policy. That was a new policy that was adopted last year. He extended, he had extensive trading, which he says was done by the third parties during the blackout periods. And that included the blackout period of March and April 2020 that got the former Dallas Fed bank president, Rob Kaplan, into trouble. Mike, Mike, I just want to stop you there. Can we just get a one clarification there? When you say that these trades were omitted from those forms, is that more of an oversight or intentional? Do we know? Well we don't know which trades were omitted of the many trades that were made, but we do know that he says it was inadvertent that the information didn't get to him or he overlooked information. He did say that what he had done instead of relying on state consolidated statements, he used balanced statements that he got from the firm that managed his money and that led him to inadvertently put some wrong figures down, which have been corrected. You mentioned that Jay Powell is looking into this, the Fed put out a statement that said it has asked its inspector general to take a look at this and they say they will accept and take appropriate actions based on the inspector general's finding. So it does seem that Rafael Bostic is trying to correct this, whether he can get by having this information disclosed, will be an interesting question because Richard Clarity had to resign early because of some trading irregularities, even though he was later cleared by the inspector general. And Rosengren, Eric Rosengren of Boston had to resign because of some inadvertent trading that he did. The Atlanta Fed board of directors, the chair, has put out a statement saying that they accept President Bostic's explanation and they have confidence in his explanation that he did not expect a profit from any FOMC related knowledge. So he's passed one test, but we'll see what the public test is like. Mike, what we do know too is that this is someone who is very well steeped in the Fed and its workings and its needs for transparency and being above and beyond when it comes to everything, especially when it comes to the financial markets. He's been at the Fed working there since 1995. He's been President of the Atlanta Fed since 2017. So what does this do coming on top of Rosengren and Kaplan and Clarity in terms of the integrity of the U.S. Central Bank? It is a very bad look, Carol. The Fed has been trying to get this trading scandal behind it. A lot of it has to do with the fact that the ethics rules are very strict at the Fed and it is easy to inadvertently break them, but to inadvertently break them for seven years is not a good look. And so it's going to be interesting to see what the reaction is on Capitol Hill. A lot of critics of the Fed after the last Fed bank presidents released their issues. And so we're probably going to hear a lot more of that in coming weeks. All right. A businessman down in Washington, DC, our economics correspondent, Michael McKee and guys, come back into this conversation and let's actually kind of start where I think Michael left off, which is there are sort of the rules and there's the law, but there's also public opinion and public perception. And we know that that in a lot of ways was a much more powerful sort of force to sort of push out the other board members who were found also have these sort of inadvertent trades. Just have to go on to Twitter. Oh boy, not again, as what the key takeaway is at the moment. We do not need this sort of distraction, these sorts of headlines. It's sort of believe pulpit that it will once again create to really hit the Federal Reserve without a time where everyone's looking at the Federal Reserve to steer this economy, to be able to tame inflation without having its own name put in the mother at the moment. Yeah, that's exactly right, Caroline. I mean, that's exactly where my head goes, which is this could not come at a worst time for the Federal Reserve, given that a lot of ethics rules were tightened up under Fed share. Jay Powell just recently, and he in fact had to sell some of his municipal bonds as a result of that for this to happen just after those three other Fed officials had to step away from the Fed as",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2890,2022-10-14 19:08:58
14665," your Fed share, J. Powell just recently. And he in fact had to sell some of his municipal bonds as a result of that. For this to happen just after those three other Fed officials had to step away from the Fed as a result. And at a time when the U.S. is battling, you know, the worst inflation it's seen in more than 40 years, credibility needs to be there. And at a time when just a month ago, Elizabeth Warren Senator, of course, requesting again from J. Powell details from all of the Fed officials about some of the individual trade-ins and Fed officials rebuffing that and saying that we fully complied with our internal regulations. And again, remain to your point. The public's perception of credibility and further maybe more regulation now that this puts on the elected officials to now really move on this. And we should just clarify here. I mean, there is still a lot we don't know about these trades, including the timing of some of them. And that Jerome Powell has asked for that Inspector General's office to look deeper into it. So we just basically reporting what we know now. We'll see a lot that needs to be looked through. Yeah. And the Fed has been aping up its rules when it comes to trading by Fed officials recently to include cryptocurrencies. So this will obviously continue probably some of their investigation into trading rules more broadly. All right, guys, as Romaine said, though, more details to be known. We'll continue and we'll get back to the markets in less than an hour's time. We're going to wrap up the trading day and the trading week are cross-platform coverage radio TV YouTube beyond the bell. We're going to count you down the close on this Friday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevek on Bloomberg Radio. Are you all listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week, Carol Maser and Tim Stenevek, live in Upper Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio, just talking with our TV colleagues? And of course, our Michael McKee breaking news at this hour. Fed Chair Jay Powell has asked the Central Banks Office of Inspector General to conduct an independent review of Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostick's financial disclosures after Bostick revealed violations, including trades during blackout periods. Bostick said in a statement Friday that he was not aware of the specific trades or timing of the transactions, which were made by a third party manager in accounts where he did not have the ability to direct trades. He detailed the transactions and corrected disclosure forms posted to the Atlanta Fed's website. He says, and this is a quote, Bostick saying this in a statement, I take very seriously my responsibility to be transparent about my financial transactions and to avoid any actual perceived conflicts of interest. Perceived conflicts of interest is the important takeaway from this, Carol. It doesn't matter whether or not something was a conflict of interest. And we deal with this as journalists all the time. It's about the perception of it. Yeah, absolutely. And listen, I think the difficulty in this is this is coming on top of Eric Rosengrin, a Boston Robert Kaplan of the Dallas Fed. And then you had Rich Clareta who left a few weeks earlier before his term ended. Again, all of this had to do with trading controversies or concerns about transactions. All right. It's a story that will continue to follow and we do learn more in the meantime. Let's get a check on the latest world in national news, but then must you in our Bloomberg newsroom. Hey, Tim, the war in Ukraine is about to take a brutal new turn. The president says they're ready for Russia's next big attack in the east when troops try to capture the Donbass region. The area already saw a train station bombed homes and a school hit and an airport destroyed. I had of midterms, Republican leaders described out of control border security, Democrats highlight progress working with Mexico on big issues like drugs, crime and irregular migration. Following up on his visit to Mexico City last month, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken is leading new security talks in Washington alongside US Attorney General Merrick Garland and Mexican diplomats. Secretary Blinken described improved cooperation. He made significant progress reflected in unprecedented investments, legislation, law enforcement action. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, the death toll in Florida from Hurricane Ian is now at least 108. The State's Medical Examiner's Commission confirmed three more fatalities related to the storm including two in Lee County. And it's up to everyone to assess their own risk for COVID, that word from Dr. Anthony Fauci. The White House Chief Medical Adviser says factors include age and vaccination status he warns coronavirus won't end, saying the current rising cases is not alarming yet.

14666," Atlanta plays Philadelphia at 430. Global news 24 hours a day on air and on Bloomberg Quicktake. Power by more than 2700 journalists and analysts in more than 120 countries. I'm Ann Mastue. This is Bloomberg. The New York City mayor released his tax returns after reluctance in here in $245,000, $324 in 2021. That does include $180,000 salary. Let me go back. Six months after he pledged to provide the public with information about his income, real estate earnings and charitable contributions. What is it with everybody? Do it transparency. Where's President Trump's? That's a whole other league. It is. I think, but the truth is, I think something changed after that because that challenged the norm of something that every presidential candidate had done for years. If you say you're going to do it, why wait? Carol, I agree with you. I'm in a little bit of a breaking mood. Because they can. The tax returns became an issue during his campaign for mayor after reports in the city that's a publication here found tax irregularities connected with his Brooklyn rental property. Adams initially refused to commit to releasing his returns before reversing course. What did he pay? He paid a little bit more than 56,000 in federal taxes. He had a 24% federal effective rate. He also paid about 19,000 in state and local taxes for the year and had a 10.1% state and local effective tax rate based on his New York state filing. Adams claimed zero charitable gifts in his 2021 taxes. A city hall spokesperson, though, said that the mayor gave about $5,000 to charity last year but did not claim the donations because of a lack of receipts. The mayor also gave to individuals who were victims of crime according to the spokesperson. He also checked a box on his tax filing signifying that he did by virtual currency in 2021. Didn't claim capital gains or losses suggesting he hadn't sold any of the cryptocurrency during 2021. That makes sense. Remember, he bowed to take his first three city paychecks in Bitcoin and Ether. So he's kind of walking the walk in the walk there. I will say a spokesperson said he's releasing the tax filings now because he filed an extension. Okay. Which is fair. Been there. Done that. Yeah. I know an extension well. He did test positive for COVID shortly before the federal tax deadline. All right. So anyway, just interesting. Just, you know, we thought, especially for our New York audience, that you might be interested. All right. We've got more to come watching the markets on this Friday.

14668," Have you with us? How are you? Michael is Tim. Dude, great. How are you? Dude, well, thanks. I just want to get something out of the way. And I don't mean this in any sort of pejorative sense, but just so our listeners know who we're talking to and what you stand for. Would you describe yourself as a Bitcoin maximalist? Ha. I'm definitely a Bitcoiner. I think that world with a successful Bitcoin is a better world. I don't know if I'd call myself a maximalist, but I would say I'm a Bitcoiner. But you lean more toward Bitcoin than any other digital currency. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fair to say that I've made a bet personally with my assets as well as with my career to focus on Bitcoin. And I'm not spending my time on any other digital assets. So Carolyn, I did took part in a big Bloomberg live event earlier this week called Bloomberg Invest. The focus of my panel was on cryptocurrencies. And it was on established asset managers like City, T-Row Price, and Susquehanna. We had representatives from those three companies, people who had up their digital assets teams, talking about what they are doing when it comes to cryptocurrencies. And a big question that came up after that was, how does somebody go and convince somebody with a retirement account or with an investment account that in addition to stocks and bonds, they should have something in there that has a short track record and a very volatile track record like cryptocurrency. How would you do that? Yeah. So the first thing I would say Tim is zoom out, right? So Bitcoin is almost 14 years old. And I think it's fair to say that that's a short track record compared to stocks or treasury bonds or gold. On the other hand, there are companies and assets today that are worth trillions of dollars that, at some point, were 14 years old and were smaller than they are today. And people were starting to figure out at that 10 to 20-year age range that these things were here to stay, that they had potential, and that they made sense for the long term. Speaking of the long term, there's no doubt that Bitcoin and all digital assets are volatile in terms of their price in the short term. But if you zoom out and you take that long term 14-year view, especially if you put it on a log scale, rather than a linear scale, what you see is you see spikes and you see plunges and you see bull markets and bear markets. And yet, on average, you see that upward trend in price over the longer arc of time. So I would say that zooming out is very helpful. And then the last thing I'd say is ask yourself the question if you think a bearer asset that has a strictly fixed supply and that functions outside the existing financial system, outside of the legacy finance and traditional finance. Oh, and by the way, clears billions of dollars in transaction volume every day. Ask yourself if that's something you'd like to have in your portfolio. As a bonus, by the way, you can secure it such that it's very hard to confiscate. And of course, it's unsensorable. So anytime you choose to pay someone, whether it's cross-border or in your neighborhood, essentially, Noah could stop you. There's a lot of value propositions, benefits, I'd say, that Bitcoin offers. And that's how I'd frame it in terms of the bigger picture. Andy, help me out, though. How am I supposed to think about this? I mean, this is something that back in November was trading at, you know, almost $68,000 today, it's 19,000. Is this Amazon for the long term? Is this pets.com for the long term? Let me out here because fixed supply to me says it's some kind of commodity that doesn't go on and on forever. And I don't know how I think about that. Yeah, so a couple of things to say there. I like how you framed it as Amazon. I actually published an article a couple of years ago liking Bitcoin to Amazon. And it was at a point at that point when Amazon was saying 2006. So there had been a bubble and a bust. And yet the thing had established itself. I'm talking about Amazon at that time. It was a market.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2894,2022-10-14 19:26:14
14669," Right, so there had been a bubble and a bust. And yet, the thing had established itself, I'm talking about Amazon at that time. It was a market leader in its niche in the market. And of course, it already had a network effect and it was building on that. Oh, and by the way, at that time, Amazon generated no cash flow. You couldn't value it like you could a standard stock. Right. It was regularly used to evade tax. Sorry. I guess what I'm trying to get at is this is, and it is early days, but it's 14 years old. So we're in kind of that sweet spot between people are, it's getting itself established that's already happened, but it still has potential upside. And that's where we are today. Hey, really quickly, just got 15 seconds. How much is your business amped up in terms of people using your platform just quickly? Because proof is in the pudding. Oh, yeah. So we've already onboarded our first handful of advisors. And so that's where we are since our launch about a month ago. All right. So we'll love to talk to you maybe in about six months and get a better idea of how many people are using it.

Bloomberg 1130 to Washington DC Bloomberg 991 to Boston Bloomberg 1061 to San Francisco Bloomberg 960 to the country Syria 6M Channel 119 and around the globe the Bloomberg Business app and Bloomberg Radio dot com. This is Bloomberg Business Week. Are you are listening and watching Bloomberg Business Week on this Friday? Hey, who said M&A activity was dead? Are you hungry? No, never go to the grocery store when you're hungry. Oh my god, I buy such garbage when I do that. To call the police. The crogr was hungry. They went for a shopping spree, right? Or potentially they will. Special in aisle feed. Are regulators going to give a nod to it? I don't know. That's the question. All right, we're going to get to that in just a moment with a row of Michelle Davis. First up, they'll back to Charlie Pellet who's watching it all. Indeed, as they head down the aisle, we've got crogr shares down now by 7.4% and Albert Sun's lower by 7.6% add that as we will hear, coming up lots of questions about the regulatory environment. That's part of the reason why both companies stocks are trading lower. We've got the Dow, the S&P and Neznek both into red right now. Slight bounce off the bottom emphasis on slight. We've got 28 minutes to go. Stocks are lower after a report showed US year ahead inflation expectations rose for the first time in seven months. We've got the S&P down now by 75 drop now at 2.1%. The Dow trading lower by 313, that is down by just about 1%. And Neznek down 290, a decline now of 2.7%. 10 real 3%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2896,2022-10-14 19:35:07

West Texas, intermediate crew down 3.9%. 8568 a barrel on WTI. Well, as for the overall market backdrop and some advice for investors, Marky Patel is Senior Portfolio Manager at All Spring Global Investments. I think that basically, equity still look very attractive because maybe one day the feds will say, well, let's, we've done enough here. Let's stand back, compromise with inflation in the interests of growing the economy. And also the very strong dollar. That says to me more than anything, that tells you the strongest economy in the world is manifested in the strengths of the dollar. So I think the US is still a good place to be. If you're invested, you'll be there in the bottom, which will come one day. Big banks, including JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, higher after reporting results, Morgan Stanley is slipping his equity trading revenue disappoints in the first wave of results. JP Morgan up 2.6% city group up 8, 10 to 1%. Wells Fargo up 2.9% Morgan Stanley down 4.8%. I'm Charlie Patel, that is a Bloomberg business splash. All right, Charlie. It was Bloomberg's group yesterday by our own, Michelle Davis, about Kroger and Albert Sins, talking about linking up in an M&A deal and today became official. We've got Michelle Davis with us. She's M&A reporter for Bloomberg News. She's with us in the Bloomberg Interactive broker studio. The official that we're talking about, Kroger, to buy Albert Sins in a $24.6 billion grocery giant deal. Michelle, congratulations because you broke the news yesterday. You were on the team that helped break this news. A huge story that reverberated, not just across this industry, which is dominated by Walmart in a handful of other players as well. But also just when it comes to M&A and this environment, the thing that I find so fascinating about this is it's partly this environment of higher costs that is leading a company like Albert Sins to get bought by Kroger. Yeah, definitely. So one thing that people forget is that the grocery stores actually were big winners during COVID because everyone started going to the grocery store a lot more. They weren't able to go to restaurants. But what we have seen is that consumers are obviously dealing with higher cost. And Kroger and Albert Sins say that together, they'll be able to cut prices and lead to a billion dollars of annual savings for consumers because they'll have increased purchasing power, all of this stuff. Obviously, it's TBD on whether the regulators will let them do that, but that's their pitch. Talk about the regulators. I mean, how massive is this company? And they have talked about right selling off some properties in order to maybe get this through. Yeah, so something that's interesting that we heard about today in the course of reporting on how this all came together is it sounds like the Kroger before they even started running the M&A math and valuation analyses spent several months looking at the antitrust analysis. They had people just running all these calculations with a big map and circling and trying to figure out how far does someone drive to go to the grocery store when they drive three miles or five miles. And they came up with this solution that you see in the announcement today where basically they know that there's around 375 stores that have overlap. A lot of them are in California, some in Texas. And so what they're proposing to do is basically they say, hey, if regulators make us divest these stores, we will put them into this spin co. That the shareholders and Albert Sins will have an equity stake in the goal. I mean, ideally they want to divest. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, they're going to spin off them into a spin co. What is that spin co? Well, so it's, yeah, so this spin co is kind of a backup plan. What they'd ideally are normally in a scenario like this, you would see them announce with the deal also third party agreements where they would say, okay, we're also going to divest these stores to these people. They didn't want to, like that's a lot of work. And so they didn't go through that whole process. This is kind of a backstaff that says, if we're not able to find buyers for these stores and we'll put them into the spin co, they are confident that this is the solution to the antitrust problem and that regulators are going to. But what do they call it? No name supermarkets? Like, if you know, like, do they operate? Progress Sims, Carol, have some creativity here. Not Croger, not Albert Sins. Croger Sins. I'm sorry, I just logistics. But I mean, look, spin co, the spin co is common during these transactions, these types of transactions. So obviously we'll get a new name at some point. So I just want to make sure I understand this. What they're going to do is essentially decide on a handful of stores that to spin off to a piece regulators if we're.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2897,2022-10-14 19:39:41
14672, a new name at some point so it's the i just want to make sure i understand this there what they're going to do is essentially decide on a handful of stores that to spin off to appease regulators if regulators ask for such a concession and then and then they'll end up competing with those stores in the future yes if regulators ask them to they will spin off the stores it's not like a certainty that they will go into the spincoe like what they prefer to that i don't know why they prefer to do is sell them to you know like other grocers but one the financing market actually is part of why they created the spinco because they were like oh well one of the buyers of last resort is private equity right you don't know how long it's going to take for us to you know close this deal or when we're going to be needing to divest the stores we don't know what the financing environment or like the economy is going to look like whenever that time comes and so they're they're backstop for that is creating this spincoe where the assets could go and they won't have any ties to Kroger anymore just because i know you but it shows that they thought about this so that the regulators will say go ahead right okay so what is the regulatory issue that is of concern here because it's about what regulators think about consumer harm right yeah they think about consumer harm they think about you know prices this is i mean this is something that hits will hit all consumers because we all go to the grocery store everyone's dealing with inflation right now and it's a it's a big political issue as well because um you know under the Biden administration anti-trust regulators have been very you know adamant about their uh you know dislike for big deals um and so this is just something that kind of hits on all of those things does it mean anybody else will do something like i'm just curious when you talk to the bankers in this space is there other things just got about 30 seconds bankers are always optimistic that there's more to come and uh and i mean this is an example of them you know feeling confident that this deal can get through they wouldn't have announced it if they didn't think that were the case well done because it felt like it came out of nowhere so really well done in terms of reporting and you really did see it in terms of market reaction uh in terms of um Albertson's in a big way yesterday when it was up about 11 and a half percent well done by the way i just loved reading everywhere uh everywhere else about this story and then you know saying bloomberg did it and i know i was like i know those people so congratulations to you Davis do you love that too yeah good weekend good weekend Michelle Davis M&A reporter up

14673," And we're going to get to a story that has to do with something that's been going on for a while. We've talked about our Shrinath Arajan, I think reporting on this and some others. And this has to do with the SEC WhatsApp probe in Wall Street. Yeah, the Broad US probe into the use of outside messaging services like WhatsApp at major banks is now sweeping and record keepers at big investment firms. The SEC has asked money managers for details on who with their firms oversees retention of electronic communications. This according to the request reviewed by Bloomberg News, the query carol, part of a letter that the regulators sent recently to some of the largest players in the industry seeking information on policies and key staff whose texts and emails are supposed to be archived. Net net, this is what it means. The fresh focus on investment firms signaling that more penalties will likely follow after the SEC in the commodity futures trading commission find banking giants, including JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, about $2 billion for their employees using outside messaging platforms to conduct official business. Howard Fisher, he's a partner at law firm Moses Singer. He says this is a quote. It shows that the SEC's probe goes beyond the largest broker dealers and that it will likely extend to all corners of the financial services sector. He goes on to say with more and more financial sector workers still not in the office five days a week and with the increased use of non-official means of communication. The potential scope for liability can be tremendous. By the way, the SEC declined to comment for this story under SEC rules money managers face less expansive record keeping rules that brokerages with retention focused on documents related to investment advice. However, like banks, investment firms are required to monitor communications involving their business to head off improper conduct. So you wonder if working from home whether we'd have you know for if the pandemic and working from home happened with this would be having this conversation probably because people are using. I don't know. I think it's so easy for us to communicate with each other nowadays. I mean, Carol, I go back to what I've said before and we've covered this. I mean, think about the different ways that you and I communicate about about work, right? Sometimes we text. Sometimes you send me instant messages on the terminal. Sometimes you email me. Sometimes we call each other. Right. Sometimes we just talk to each other. Yeah, I want to try to avoid that. We spent three hours a day together anyway. I'm just kidding. They got it. Friday.

The following is an editorial from Bloomberg Opinion. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board. In Beijing next week, Xi Jinping will almost certainly claim a third term as head of the ruling Communist Party, cementing his status as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. The precedent-shattering move is fraught with risks from economic instability at home to adventurism abroad. To guard against them, the US must remain disciplined and focused on building up its own strengths. That means bolstering its defenses against economic disruptions, for example, by continuing to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains. The US also should embrace the advantages of its more open system rather than trying to emulate China's command economy. By clinging to power, Xi is leading China into uncharted territory. That's all the more reason for the US to maintain a steady course. This editorial was written by the Bloomberg Editorial Board.

14675," Right away, Want me to broke into attacks V Paul indigenous Excuse me, I want to drive. It's the question of the drive. This is the drive to the club. The fun community will drive up to Yovidon on Bloomberg Radio. Right everybody, just under 10 minutes left in the trading session, getting ready to wrap up the trading day, the trading week. A week that was chuckful of so much. We've got big bank earnings, inflation reports, fed minutes. What am I leaving out? Is there anything? Consumer confidence. Consumer confidence sentiment. Sentiment, that was a big one. In terms of inflationary expectations. Next we get a little bit of real estate stuff. And kind of the earnings just stuff is getting started, Carol. Yeah, absolutely. And we're seeing pressure on the equities. We're pretty much as Charlie just mentioned. We're holding on to our lows of the session. Let's get into it with Emily Rolllin, Co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. Emily joins us on the phone from Boston. Emily, how are you this afternoon? I'm great. Hi, Carol. Hey Tim. Nice to be with you. It's good to have you with us. Really appreciate you taking the time this afternoon. How should we read into the market right now? I mean, we're at a point where we're seeing the feds attempt to get inflation under control. Really not be as successful as they'd hoped. And there are concerns that the feds can have to be even more aggressive to make it happen. Yeah, there's certainly been a lot for markets to digest this week. And today as well. And I think inflation dynamics really are front and center. Inflation, of course, has been sort of enemy number one as far as the backup and rates, as far as the fed hawkishness. And then it is just not going away. You mentioned the University of Michigan survey that came out today, which showed that inflation expectations actually rose in October in the early part of the month here for the first time in several months here. So we're seeing that even though gas prices are coming down a little bit, consumers are still really sort of facing these really elevated inflationary pressures for things like food, things like home prices. So that's going to be a big challenge. And then we've heard sort of a flurry of fed speakers out this morning as well, really reiterating the fact that rates are going up. Maybe we need to get there sooner. Maybe they need to be higher. And it's likely a raise and hold type scenario here. So inflation is certainly not healthy. Even though we did see oil prices come down a little bit, but that didn't help enough. Emily, I think we've got to start thinking about looking forward, because markets tend to price things in. And Mike McKee follows the international economic scene and policy scene, and certainly the fed and other central bankers. You know, made the point yesterday because we focused so much on shelter costs, saying it takes a long time for shelter to get into the inflation numbers, a long time to get out, but it's a lagging indicator. So help me out when you've got a week where airlines are up about 4.6% the equities. You know, there's optimism. People are flying, corporate travel coming back. You focus on leading economic indicators. What are they and what are they telling you? Yeah, so you're right that the fed is by nature focused on lagging economic data. And inflation being wanted, not employment being another. Unfortunately, those two things are really the last shoe to drop in an economic slowdown. And we don't want to, you know, friends don't let friends use back or looking economic data. That's why we're focusing on the leading data. And we like to use the conference boards leading indicators. It's some of the bigger components or things like weekly manufacturing hours work. So if companies are considering making changes to their labor force, as margins become compressed, they might cut hours before they lay people off. Another big component is the ISM new order component of the PMI indices. So really what that suggests is it tells us about how strong demand is for manufacturing firms. And we're seeing all of those things, you know, start to roll over here. And that suggests to us that we're going to start to roll over in a positive way? No, in a negative way. So we're seeing a deceleration in those components. And, you know, we want to be mindful of that. It's tough to say we're in a recession now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2901,2022-10-14 19:57:57
14676," in a negative way. So we're seeing a de-celeration in those components and we want to be mindful of that. It's tough to say we're in a recession now with unemployment near a 50-year-low but we're probably going there. And frankly some parts of the market are pricing that in. We're down over 25% in equity markets. That's more than two-thirds of the way there as far as your average bear market but bonds just aren't placing it in. So we'll be able to have gone up and we think that creates a really attractive entry point given we actually see the entire yoke are moving down into next year. And the attractive entry point just for fixed income? Is there an attractive entry point for US equities right now? So definitely for fixed income. So the fact that we're getting high, you know close to 5% on high quality bonds. I mean none of us have been able to say that in a really long time over 10 years. And we think you know moving up the capital structure of getting paid income, decent income is really really competitive with the returns that you can earn on stocks. But I think in terms of looking at the equity market there is a compelling entry point for some areas of the market. We look at things like the quality factor. So these are companies with great balance sheets. Good return on equity. Lots of cash on their balance sheets. Basically a limited need to you know tap the capital market in order to grow or to be profitable. And the quality factor is down over 26% while the S&P 500 is actually down less. This is pretty unusual dynamic in our opinion. You know if you think about a company that needs capital to grow, you know these zombie light companies or even on the high yield side jump bond issuers, we don't think that those are the ones that are likely to continue outperforming in a global recession. So quality is on our list. These are quality factor names across different industry groups. But anything to point out specifically. Yeah. So we actually for quality technology stock to the US are actually sort of the poster child for us. And I think you need to differentiate within technology. So we're not talking about those you know momentum growth at any price type tech names ones that aren't making money. We're talking about your sort of classic S&P 500 tech sector. A lot of these big companies have tons of cash on their balance sheets. They're well positioned and maintained profitability in the sea celebrating growth environment. I can think of one company with a traditional tech company in the S&P 500 with a lot of cash on its balance sheet. I'll just leave it there. Yeah, we do. Isn't it hard to take a position there right now with all this volatility? I mean to be quite honest and just got about 20 seconds left here. Yeah, why would you take why would you take a position right now? I understand long term investing but with so much volatility is it smart to maybe kind of let things settle down at this point? Just quick. I think it's smart to let things settle down by taking positions in more defense of it in higher quality parts of the market. Look, we don't want to be out of this market. As I said before, we're two fades third to the way there to an average bear market stocks are on sale at 15 times forward earnings. You just want to be real thoughtful about how you're positioning portfolio. Just going to put it out there. The only major industry group in the S&P 500. There are 11 of them that's doing well this year's energy up 46% everything else is down. All right, Emily, good to check in with you. Emily Roland over at John and high and cock investment management joining us on the phone from Boston. She's the Co-Chief Investment Strategist.

14677," down here. So we're at our lows of the session. That means down more than 3% on the Nasdaq down about 2.5% on the S&P 500. So you're really feeling this negative tone Tim going into the weekend. A negative tone, but we got some optimism just now from Emily Roland, Co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. She not only sees an attractive entry point right now for fixed income, a better entry point than we've seen over the last decade. She says, but there's a compelling entry point for some of the higher quality companies, the quality factor companies and specifically tech companies, classic S&P 500 tech companies that she says are attractive right now. Interest, I guess if you believe the forward PE ratios, those for being that I've been debating it all depends on if we're an historically new environment and that of course is the question. I don't believe anything right now. Okay, do you believe in Santa Claus? I do. I absolutely do. In all seriousness though, I mean, and we don't obviously have time to do this big discussion, but the tail is point. I think we also need to kind of start talking about some of those ultra metric because I think when you start looking at price to sales and some of the other metrics, the value, the price to cash flow, valuation metrics look way different than just on a PE. Can we do PE if they have no E? That's the ongoing battle for you. But also it's about the alternative, the alternatives you mentioned, whether it's in a fixed income that has a better entry point is just hearing from Emily Rowland. Yeah, from Emily Rowland there, and we're going to hear right now the closing bells here in New York on this Friday afternoon, another wild week here in the market. It looked like just I don't know a couple days ago, we were talking about a big rally on our hands here yesterday and not a couple of days ago yesterday, all sort of a blur here. Never the less the Dow Jones industrial average going to finish the day lower by about 1.3%. The S&P 500 down by about 2.4% and the NASDAQ composite down by more than 3% here on the day, the Russell 2000 going to close down by about 2.6%. And you're also seeing big declines here on the day and both the Philadelphia semiconductor index as well as the KBW Bank index too. Right, we just see the continued out performance as I've been talking over the last couple of days for the airlines which are up more than 4% this week. But did you guys see for the week overall, we know the NASDAQ's down more than 3% the S&P down one and a half percent the Dow actually gained of about 1.2% Yeah, sort of the go ahead. No, go ahead. I never interrupt. That is of course, Carol, sort of the only index that is fucking the trend of a weekly loss. Of course, that you mentioned the Dow. Take a look at where we are on a sector level and Carol, to your point, it is read all the way across the screen except for the lone green sector and that is the financials. A lot of the financials, of course, that we heard from today are getting a boost. Hires, which is 1, 2, even 4% a little bit earlier. I know that we'll dig into that everywhere else. So a lot of red on the screen to end out this week and some of this is sort of that classic risk off trade. You have materials and energy and auto and semis in there. But you also have technology and you know, Tim, earlier to your point about what is the safe haven in this environment, technology not even able to catch a bid either all of these curled are off about three to even six and a half percent. Yeah, really significant moves certainly to the downside there. So in terms of gainers, really a big standout in today's trade, no doubt about it where the big banks. In fact, the top three out of four names in the S&P 500 were the big banks, JP Morgan among them up more than 5% at its highs today, finishing the day with about a 1.7% gain. We know posted record, quarterly net interest, income raise its gondons for the year. So a lot going on there for that one. US bank core, this one was up about 3.4% by the close number one in the S&P 500 stock was higher out of the gate moved up after US bank core one approvals from the Fed and the office of the com troller of the currency to acquire M U F G U union bank. They also that news came just hours after the bank reported third quarter results, which showed revenue net interest margins beating analyst estimates. So that was definitely an app performer. And then the airlines, I know I've been talking about it a lot Delta adding on another 2.3% in today's trade, talking the S&P 500, getting an upgrade by cow in today after yesterday's third quarter revenue report and saying that fourth quarter profit is outpacing expectations, thanks to biz travelers, but airlines really outperformance for the week overall. And don't forget, we're going to get some more news in terms of earnings from airlines next week. Okay, from the skies to the ground, though, because we got to talk Tesla, the company closed down 7.6% today, extending its slump from a record reach last November to 50% Tesla shares, now trading at $205. We did get a note from Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas earlier today who said that 20 23 estimates for the automotive sector.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2903,2022-10-14 20:05:39
14678," 50% Tesla shares now trading at $205. We did get a note from Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas earlier today who said that 2023 estimates for the automotive sector must fall significantly, but of course higher rates not helping a company like Tesla much either. Also first republic, the biggest decline on a percentage basis in the S&P 500 today, the worst performer there, it said net interest margin for 2022 now expected to be at the lower end of its guidance range. Investor sending shares down by 16.4%. Beyond meat finishing down 10% lowered its full year sales outlook, it said it's going to cut about a fifth of its global workforce, including several top executives. We should also note that COO Doug Ramsey, remember he was suspended back in September after he was arrested on allegations that he bit of man's nose is leaving the company. Funny that. Let's have a quick look at what's happening in terms of commodities because I mean, I go cross asset for a moment. A sea of red, why? Because you've got one area of green and is the US dollar strength. That means commodities roll over somewhat. We've got WTI crude up by 3% Brent crude also off by about 3%. This is we worry about global growth trajectory and pull down our forecast for demand somewhat. So you steal on the downside, natural gas remain pointed out earlier. Longest losing street, eight straight weeks, that's the longest since 21 years ago. So we're down 4% we've rolled off about 30% from our highs that we had back in natural gas. That's because we've got record production. We've also got milder weather at the moment, milder weather of course, roiling coffee in some ways. We've got prices falling for coffee, thank goodness, but I orange juice is costing you more a breakfast. We know why because of the weather here in the US. I'm looking at foreign exchange at the moment and we are seeing big moves in the Japanese yen. We are seeing one percentage point weakness. This as we see actually the finance minister over at the IMF once again trying to talk about some of the extraordinary moves, the FX volatility here is so worried about the concerns about the one-sided nature of the moves in the Japanese yen, which is at a near 24 year low. But the dollar is really in large part to answer to that as well as I put my MPs back in. The dollar index is the strengthening side of this equation. We know why the underlying inflationary areas that we see within the University of Michigan, the fact that consumer sentiment does see inflation sticking around for longer and a more elevated level. The Canadian dollar we've just seen, the Bank of Canada just speaking about concerns within that economy. We could buy 9.10% as oil falls lower. Don't even get me started on where the pound was today higher than lower as we worry about the U-turn with Liz Truss. Soren Bonds yields push higher across the board. In fact, GILTS did back up once again Bonds, four yields rise as we didn't get enough from the UK Prime Minister Taylor. Yeah, Roman, I'm going to keep this quick. The story is the same. YILTS are higher and we're getting big round numbers of 450 on a two year and a 401 now on the 10 year yield the highest and so seven. Yeah, and look guys, I do want to go back to the breaking news that we had about an hour ago here and that involving the Atlanta Fed President Rafael Bostic saying that his asset managers made trades that broke central bank rules. Now we're learning that FedG or J-PAL has asked for an investigation by the Inspector General's Office to be open into what happened there. And I guess this kind of brings us back to where we were, I don't know, about a year ago. Let's bring in Michael McKee here, our economics correspondent. Mike, I mean, it was, I don't know, about a year ago back in 2021 when we were kind of talking about all of these sort of disclosures that got unearth regarding Kaplan and Rosa Grand later, Clara and even Powell, themselves, about the trading activity of these Fed officials. What's new and what's different about what we've learned when it comes to Rafael Bostic? Well this is another ethics question, a Fed that is struggling to defeat inflation and keep its credibility doesn't need. Bostic admitted improper and undisclosed trading, which he says was done by a third party that he hired in order to stay out of ethics trouble, but he says he misunderstood the Fed's regulations and the third party traded on his behalf at times when it should not. He says the mistakes have been corrected, but he's filed five years of amended financial disclosure forms and says, I want to be clear, at no time did I knowingly authorize or complete a financial transaction based on non-public information or with any intent to sidestep my obligations of transparent and accountable reporting. He says he did not make profits on this, but guys, he says in his statement only a limited number of trades were made on his behalf during the blackout period, but the Fed's ethics officers say he admitted substantial numbers of securities transactions from the disclosure forms. He said he had extensive trading during blackout periods, including that March, April 2020.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2904,2022-10-14 20:09:58
14679," substantial numbers of securities transactions from the disclosure forms. He had extensive trading during blackout periods, including that March, April 2020 period, when the Fed was intervening in markets. And the president of, while the president of the Atlanta Fed says the Board of Directors there has accepted his explanation. As you mentioned, the chairman of the Federal Reserve is now asking for an Inspector General's investigation. And they say they will take whatever action is appropriate. Mike, we've heard a lot about what over the last year about what Fed officials are not supposed to do when it comes to their own trading and it comes to their own investments. What are they allowed to do? How can a Fed official participate in markets? Well, it's got to the point where they can have very little. They can do index funds. They can hold treasury securities, but in funds not trade them actively. It's really been sort of clamped down on, but the issue is when you hire somebody else to do your trading because you don't want to be involved in it, they may have incentives to trade. You can imagine a fund manager looking at what was going on in March and April of 2020 and thinking, you know, I need to move money around. And unfortunately that money belonged to someone who was involved in all of this. And it makes him look bad. Now, we don't know for sure whether Bostic himself did anything wrong. He says this was all done on his behalf, but it sure looks bad. And as I mentioned, this is a time when the Fed is trying to hold onto some credibility. And we've had a number of these trading issues come up over the last 12 to 18 months. All right, our thanks to our Michael McKee of Bloomberg News. Follows the Fed and monetary policy globally and obviously giving and weighing in on that latest news involving Rafael Bostic. We'll continue to cover it up Bloomberg News from more head to Bloomberg.com or check out the Bloomberg terminal. That's a wrap for our cross-platform coverage radio TV, YouTube, beyond the bow. We will see you again, same time, same place on Monday. This is Bloomberg Business Week with Carol Maser and Bloomberg Quick Takes Tim Stenevig on Bloomberg Radio. Hey, it's Bloomberg Business Week Tim Stenevig and Carol Maser. Let's get a check on the latest world and national news at NMOS to you in our Bloomberg Newsroom. Hey Tim, the suspect of a deadly mass shooting in Raleigh, North Carolina said to be a 15-year-old male was taken into custody with life-threatening injuries. Five people were killed. Two others injured and off-duty police officer. Among those killed, here's North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper today. I saw the faces of Raleigh police officers last night and their pain was evident. I know that's happening all over the city. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper today. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers predicting further financial troubles after the recent turbulence in the UK and attacking global finance chiefs for doing little to address some developing nations getting shut out of the bond market. I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets and I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There are some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. Summers spoke with David Weston on Bloomberg Wall Street Week. Here's a full interview coming up at 6th Wall Street Time. Here on Bloomberg Radio, hearing aids will be sold over the counter starting Monday without a fitting from a doctor seen as a positive move from those in the audiology industry.

Have we gone like 2.5 hours or 2 hours in heaven? Did we even mention Elon Musk or you thought? I talked about Tesla. Just because it's down 50% from November of last year. But we can't go whole show and not talk about Elon Musk. He's been in the news a lot. Let's start with the other things. Well, for everything. Did you see his... Cologne.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2905,2022-10-14 20:14:07
14680," about Elon Musk. He's been in the news a lot. Yep. Let's start with the other things. Well, for everything. Did you see his... Cologne? I've heard of places. He's selling Cologne. A place to order. No, I didn't. Did you see this though? No, I did. Okay, good. Because these were... This is not what we're supposed to be talking about right now. I know. But he basically said with a name like his, it's surprising it's taken him so long to come out with a Cologne. I know. Touls can't be too far. Do you want to start with the Twitter news? Yeah. Twitter sought documents related to US investigation of Elon Musk. Twitter's lawyers tried again last week to learn what Elon Musk had told federal authorities who were investigating his attempt to take the social media company private. Attorneys for Twitter wrote to a Delaware judge on October 6, Carol, saying they needed documents about the probes this according to a letter and sealed in court on Thursday. Yeah, this story actually coming out late last night. Musk had, by that point, reversed himself on walking away from the $44 billion takeover. But he and the social media company were still adversaries in court and their fight had not yet been officially put and unhulled. Yeah, it's going on still. It is. Let's go to the other Elon Musk story. Because he's on Twitter a big time about this. He has. And he's been talking a lot about Russia and Ukraine. And we know that he did through SpaceX, and in SpaceX's Starlink program, which offers satellite-based internet access, provide internet access for Ukrainians. It's been crucial for them staying in touch right during the war. Well, the Pentagon confirming that it's talking with Elon Musk who has threatened to stop funding Ukraine's access to a Starlink satellite communication system. But pointedly, added that the US is also looking into other options. It's just very interesting. I mean, they've been helping the Ukraine forces on the ground. Starlink terminals have supported infrastructure across the country. And any move to withdraw them could potentially hinder progress in the counteroffensive against Russian troops. It would also risk a backlash, not just from Ukraine, but also its allies, which have provided financial and military support for months without condition. So a lot going on there.

From Bloomberg World, Hank Waters, I'm Charlie Paddock. We begin with the developing story headline from the Bloomberg Professional Service, Nicola Founder, Trevor Milton, who's been found guilty of defrauding investors will have more details as they become available. It was a down day for the Dow, the S&P, and NASDAQ. Familiar themes, a losing week as well for the S&P 500 index down one and a half percent. The Dow on the week, however, up for a second week, gaining this week by 1.1 percent. Today, however, stocks fell after a report showed US year ahead in Placian Expectations rose for the first time in seven months. S&P down 86, down 2.4 percent, ending the week heading into the weekend. The 3587, the Dow today down 404, a drop there of 1.3 percent.

I'm Charlie Pellet. That is a Bloomberg business plan. All right, Charlie. Thank you. Charlie mentioned a jury in the Nicola Founder. His fraud trial reaching a verdict. We're talking about Trevor Milton's criminal fraud trial, reaching that verdict. Milton 40 is charged with two counts of securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud for misleading investors about the electric truck company's prospects. Yeah, just once again, we're repeating Nicola Founder Trevor Milton guilty of defrauding investors. The jury has reached a verdict and that is the verdict, Carol. All right, so just wanted to give you an update. All right, you might remember back in late June, maybe, maybe not. Redburn limited an analyst to Alex Hasill noted that Amazon's cloud storage business was on course for $3 trillion in value, almost triple with the whole company was worth at the time in the stock market. Global demand for cloud, we know, continues to grow. That means demand to for workers in all aspects of that space. With that in mind, Amazon Web Services worked with the Gallup organization about the digital workspace. We wanted to hear a little bit more about their findings. With us, on that is Jonathan Rothwell. He is principal economist at Gallup. He joins us on the phone from Washington, D.C. Scott Barnerson is general manager of training at Amazon Web Services and he is with us on the phone in Seattle. Guys, I want to talk about this collaboration and the findings, but before we do so, every leader that comes on our air right now, we've got to ask about the macro environment. Jonathan, you're the principal economist at Gallup. How would you describe today's macro environment and the biggest concerns? Well, I think the later market continues to be strong and those reports have been great. So obviously inflation is what everybody is worried about at this point. My view is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2907,2022-10-14 20:22:55
14682, those reports of have been great uh... so the big yeah obviously inflation is is everybody's worried about this point i'd my view is that it was largely caused by at first access spending in response to coven nineteen and then uh... exacerbated by the crisis uh... in russian you crane hopefully those things will start to wear off as the fed raises interest rates and we can have a smooth landing but really that's just my my best guess of where things are going to this point they've got a one-of-a-barnish conversation scott barns parents and uh... general manager of training at amazon web services uh... it's got i mean this is something that you have to think about to when you're making decisions about hiring people when you're making decisions about expanding and growing your team how are you thinking about the economy right now well the thing is you know none of us have the ability to predict the future and so it's really right now about focusing on the areas where you're going to get a return on investment and minimizing unnecessary risk and and what we see from our customers as well as you frankly our own planning is you know having highly trained skilled workers is your best path to success and through uncertainty right that one's building products your customers care about finding opportunities to operate more efficiently you know it's short helping your bottom line through kind of navigating these these rock times well scott are you are what are you hearing from customers right now what's getting to you from customers carolina talk a lot about this with you know executives at big companies how they're thinking about tech spend and how they're thinking about spending right now what can you tell us about what you're hearing from them well i think the last couple of years have really highlighted the fact that every company is now a digital company if they didn't recognize that before the pandemic it all but suddenly was a new reality and so those investments are are really coming in the way in the form of how do we innovate faster in this market where you know competitors are investing in digital skills and technology to get closer to customers produced time to market and customers expected right so uh... i think that's front and center how do we deliver near-term customer value while maintaining that operational efficiency and and frankly this isn't a trend that will reverse right it just accelerated through the pandemic and we see that carrying through going forward alright just what i mentioned uh... we're going to back to our conversation moment but just crossing and i'm seeing this on twitter as well we've been murdoch exploring combining fox corp and news court this is coming from down zones uh... we're talking about the rothwell principle economist at gallup scott barnison general manager of training at amazon web services so john think come on back into the conversation tell us what scott the team at a w.s. came to you and said hey listen we want to find out more information when it comes uh... to the cloud and the digital world and the kind of workers that are needed yeah so it was a really ambitious project we ended up surveying thirty thousand workers in nineteen countries those countries represent two thirds of global gdp so largest economies in the world india china uk germany u.s among them and uh... in addition we interviewed ninety uh... nine thousand hiring managers people who oversee the hiring of digital workers as well as other workers throughout the organizations and would it and the core questions are what happens to companies when they adopt digital technologies how does that affect their innovation and productivity the revenue growth and uh... what what kinds of uh... income premium do we see for workers who have digital skills and how does that vary across these markets and what are the aggrate of aggrate effects on on gdp both uh... at those country levels and then and then globally and we're able to answer uh... i think it in a pretty interesting novel way all those questions in the report hey john then i just want to stick with you for the last thirty seconds and we're coming back with you for more what do you what do you see as far as some of those numbers that you can share with us about the way that you know this type of technical knowledge can actually help increase gdp or help but bridge and not a skills gap or knowledge gap in the country well just to give you a flavor some of the findings we found that a digital skills globally contribute eighteen point five trillion dollars,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2908,2022-10-14 20:26:56

That is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. I want to get back to our guests, Jonathan Rothwell, Principal Economist at Gallup, still with us on the phone from Washington, DC. Scott Burnison is General Manager of Training at Amazon Web Services to with us on the phone from Seattle. And we're talking about the cloud. We're talking about cloud skills. We're talking about what's needed. So I mean, what are the initiatives, Scott, that you as a result of working with Gallup, doing a survey, doing some research, what are the initiatives that you guys are thinking about to make sure that you have the right skilled workforce? Yeah, there's a couple things you're starting with, kind of broad base. We announced in 2020 our intent to train 29 million people in cloud skills for free. By the year 2025, we're making great progress against that. And that's a whole bunch of different programs that are accessible, really to anyone with an internet connection and an interest in learning. So digital courses and other programs that are designed to help folks get the skills they need to be successful. I think on the other end of the spectrum, we're trying to bring really compelling experiences to our customers to help land those skills. So we launched as an example of a video game earlier this year where learners actually are in an open world environment, getting hands on keyboard, building services on AWS, kind of understanding in real world scenarios, how they might apply these skills on the job. So it's a really diverse portfolio, trying to meet learners where they are. Hey, Jonathan, how much of a gap do we have here when it comes to skills fluency in the US? I mean, how bad is it? We hear about this all the time, and we hear about it a lot in the context of companies looking for employees. But what about big picture when it comes to economic development and kind of keeping up with the world? Well, one way to quantify is look at vacancies relative to the number of workers looking for jobs. And by that measure, it's the hardest to fill line of work in the economy. And that's consistent with rising wages for software developers, people with digital skills, people with cloud architecture skills. And that certainly shows up in our data and our global survey. We found that in high income countries, you get basically $30,000 more in annual salary. If you have advanced digital skills compared to people who don't use digital skills. In terms of how the US stacks up, what was, I think one of the more interesting findings that came out of this is that there's a very high percentage of workers around in the world and in many middle income countries that have advanced digital skills. And those countries are investing heavily in the companies that are going there or being started up there are investing heavily in many cases in digital skills. And you see those benefits not only for the workers, but for those companies where the likelihood that they introduced a new product is roughly twice as high if the company uses advanced digital workers compared to just basic digital workers. If they run most of their business on the cloud, they're also much more likely to say they introduced a new product. And revenue growth is much more likely to be higher. We found all those things. So huge benefits to both companies and workers all around the world. Well, it's interesting. And I thought the research that you guys did together, and I'm just reading from a release, advanced digital skills like cloud architecture and software development, add an estimated $6.3 trillion annually to global gross domestic product and organizations with high levels of digital skill usage report annual revenues that are approximately 168% higher than companies that do not use digital skills. So saving some.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2911,2022-10-14 20:39:58
14686," of digital skill usage report annual revenues that are approximately 168% higher than companies that do not use digital skills. So saving some final thoughts Scott, for you, I mean, I think about our audience, it's an investing audience. We increasingly, Tim, I feel like every conversation we have, we talk about the digital world and the skills that are needed. So what do you think our audience kind of needs to keep in mind, Scott? Well, I think they want to evaluate the ways in which companies they care about are taking care of their customers. And really, when we think about the metrics that matter for digital businesses that kind of mean time to value for introducing new products, new features, the ability to listen to customers and respond quickly, it's really a key metric for success. And of course, all the other parts of the business matter. But in order to do that, if you're going to be successful in reducing time to value, you've got to have fluency across the organization on digital, right? Everyone needs to speak the same language. Then you've got to invest in the people you have, the folks that have been in technology for their whole lives, but now need a new toolkit to be successful in today's digital world and on the cloud. Well, and I think about the programs you're doing. We constantly keep talking about people going out to the workforce and then getting training as they go so that they meet the demands of what employers need. Hey, guys, thank you so much. Have a great weekend. Jonathan Rothwell, principal economist at Gallup, joining us from the nation's capital in Scott Barnison, General Manager of Training and Amazon Web Services on the phone from Seattle. Want to get back to a top story right now? Yeah, we're following a report from Dow Jones that says that Rupert Murdoch is exploring recombining a Fox Corp and newscorp. We say recombining because he split them apart back in 2013. So I guess you could say potentially what's old is new again. We've got Bloomberg News Entertainment Editor, Chris Paul Mary on the phone from Los Angeles right now. Chris, give us some historical context here. Why less than a decade after breaking up these assets and sending the print to one and sort of TV and entertainment assets to another? And yes, a lot has happened in that time in the last nine years. Why would a media company such as newscorp and Rupert Murdoch look at recombining these assets? Well, those two businesses have changed a lot in those nine years. The original idea was the print was having a lot of trouble. All of the online ads were disappearing. And the growth engine was cable PV and Fox News. And so the idea was to separate that and then get that higher value for that business. And then the Murdoch tried to grow that again. They made them run against time water, which was ultimately unsuccessful. And after that, they felt they weren't big enough at Fox to compete with the Disney's and Netflix's and that. And so they sold most of their entertainment assets to Disney. And then it became a very different business. It was really just Fox News, Fox Block, Task Corp, really just focused on news and sports. And so at the same time, the newscorp business actually was revived. The lawsuit general was one of the handful of newspapers that has really seen significant growth in digital subscriptions. And so they've made it also diversified. They bought assets in real estate, willter.com, digital businesses. And so newscorp is again a growth business. So putting them together just simplifies that and control on the Murdoch family. All right. So I'm watching the share prices, Chris, in the after hours. And Shares of Fox are dead about 1.5% newscorp is up about 2%. I'm looking at who owns what? I mean, Rupert Murdoch owns right the bulk of newscorp. Help me out understanding because there's different classes of shares. And I'm just trying to understand that if they want to put it together, is it easy for the family to bring everything back under the fold, under one fold, I guess I should say? A question we don't know the answer to is whether this vote, if murdering the two would be just the independent shareholders or whether the Murdoch's would be allowed to vote. They have about 40% of a voting stock in both companies and only about 10% of the actual equity. But obviously it's a voting stock that matters if they vote. And so as they wanted to merge them, they could largely do so on their own. And so as they wanted to do so on their own, they could do so on their own.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2912,2022-10-14 20:44:17

14688," Dr. Ock said to be considering recombining Fox, Corp and news Corp operations, putting back together a media empire that he will split in that he did split in 2013. This, according to the Wall Street Journal, the journal citing people familiar with the matter, according to the newspaper, special board committees have been set up by both companies to study a potential deal and evaluate possible terms. Nicola founder Trevor Milton has been convicted of fraud for misleading investors in the electric truck company.

I'm Charlie Palette, that is a Bloomberg business flash. All right, Charlie. Thank you so much. So, man, so much going on this week, so much going on on this Friday. So we thought we'd wrap up with something a little bit lighter fair, maybe you're thinking about some holidays and some vacations and some time off. It's time-carol to plan that ski trip. Yeah, let's do it. And we've got four new hotels at TopSki Resorts worth their weight in snow, and this story is part of our Bloomberg Business Weeks team and their coverage. Bloomberg proceeds deputy editor Jim Gaddy is on this story for us on this Friday. Jim, nice to have you here. We all need a break. I feel like my brain's going to explode from all the market news, from all the recession talk, you name it, deals. So tell me about where I might want to go to do some nice skiing. Hi, Carol. You never guessed that it was easy than basically whether in New York City today. But I identified four areas of the world. One of them just reopened Japan. There is a new, that soon is so nice, that goes to me, hotel opening in the Hokkaido region. You know, it's hard to say what the actual interest is, but based on the readership of the story that we've done on Japan reopening, a lot of people are interested in going back to Japan this year. The skiing in Hokkaido is incredible. I haven't been, but like all my friends on the west coast have gone and I'm so jealous of them, because there's just incredible snow there. One thing that is amazing is it's so much cheaper to ski there and to stay there than in so many other parts of the world, including the US. That sticks out to me because the other hotels that are featured in this started five, six, six hundred and fifty bucks a night. The one in Hokkaido starts at three fifty nine per person per night. What people love about Hokkaido is a lack of crowds. All the things that drive people crazy about skiing in the US doesn't happen in Japan right now, Jim. Yeah, you know, I'm glad you brought that up. 359 and 9 is really pretty good value, especially when you consider you have views outside or window of Mount Annapurri. You've got an 86,000 square foot wellness facility with spa treatment to restaurants run by chefs with Michelin Star Resimit. You know, I mean, it's a really good value. You know, the other place that was kind of jumping out to me, you know, France, my boss right now, Chris, who's usually on this program, is in France right now. Tough assignment. Yeah, right. The largest ski area in the world, France is three valley. There's a new hotel called InLodge and Spa. And it's a little bit more expensive. 630 bucks a night, depending on what the exchange rate is for the euro. But again, you know, you're talking like the skiing, it's like, you know, on a scale of 100 due to care if it's a 91 or 92, you know, I mean, the skiing is going to be fantastic. But this way a real good ride in the morning, you would be in no time. You you would. You are completely busy and always okay guys五 million. Mohammad read. Ali Said al-Tur Desqeism went away.

14689," like the skiing, it's like on a scale of 100 due to care if it's a 91 or 92. You know, I mean the skiing is going to be fantastic, but this is the area of St. Martin, the Bellville is known already for, you know, great skiing, but also the restaurants in that resort area. And here, you know, you've got all that plus 52 foot indoor swimming pool, sauna, steam room, five course dinners. You know, if you're going to spend, you know, the week in the Alps, this is a place to go. Yeah, I'm going to assume this in pretty good wine too, while you're off the slopes. What about like the traditional places like Colorado? Too crowded. Oh, come on. You know, Winter Park is the oldest, continuously operating ski resort in the United States. But you know, they have a place of their own, 500 bucks a night. It's a new hotel called the A-Frame Club. If you're familiar with architecture, you are familiar with A-Frame building. These are like individual little caddo that look like A-Frame houses. Very cute. It brings like a 1970s meat, I don't know, Brooklyn kind of vibe. Can I say, I'm looking at the picture, Jim, and I'm like, is that a shag rug? I don't know if it is, but the couch is definitely 1970s. Yeah, yeah. It's a bit of a throwback. And, you know, the decor, it really just kind of screams, cozy. Let's go, you know, shit, there's a fur. Screams Brady Bunch, I'm just going to tell you, partridge family, all that good stuff. But if you want to play some of the US, just get where you care. Sorry, Jim, that we keep cutting you off. Sorry. It's Idaho though, because everybody seems to be, well, during the pandemic, so many people moved to Idaho in Colorado, and of course the American West as well. Selkirk Mountains, we got 670 a night at the hummingbird. What does it offer? You know, it's, the Selkirk Mountains move kind of new to me, in terms of like a skiing destination. But, you know, it's got a motto called a work hard, play hard, rest well, instruction. It's more family oriented. And, you know, it's got co-working spaces to your point, Tim. And my favorite thing, the kids can play with the dogs that are on patrol at the hotel. Oh, about that. Oh, man, I mean, I'm still, I'm Japan. That's what I'm looking at. Jim, do you ski? No. I've been a couple of times. And, you know. All right, we're done. I've been a couple of times. If you need to send someone from your team to do any recon or anything, you know, I'm your guy, okay? It's probably like a get-monger. You're volunteering for the Harvard. I'm volunteering for it. But if you need somebody to check out the, you know, lodges and things and really check out the amenities like the spa's, I'm your person. Do a remote. Carol, we can do it. All right, Jim Gatti. I'm just sending you to winter park. That's fine. All right, Jim. Jim Gatti, thank you so much. Bloomberg pursued deputy editor Jim Gatti. Be sure to check that story. You can find it online. Check out all things pursuits. It's just a nice break from the day loose of some serious news. I'm looking at the most red on the past hour and so many of these stories like just broke. Have you heard of the Friday news dump, Carol? That's what's happening right now. Oh my God. We had another top fed official revealing he violated central bank policy and financial transactions. This leading chair, Jay Powell to open a probe in the latest chapter of a broader fed ethics scandal. We're talking about Atlanta fed president Rafael Bostick saying today that his asset managers made trades during restricted periods. The Atlanta fed saying Bostick had corrected his financial disclosures going back to 2017. That's the year he became chief after discovering the omissions. As we spoke about throughout the program today, it comes at an opportunity time for the federal reserve as it tries to maintain its credibility. At a time when inflation is running rampant here in the US and of course around the world as well, just another headache for Fed share Jay Powell that he has to deal with. And then what else can we talk about? Yeah, I want to talk about the number two most red on the Bloomberg terminal. It's about Nickle of founder Trevor Milton has been.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2915,2022-10-14 20:57:25
14690," around the world as well. Just another headache for Fed share, J. Powell, that he has to deal with. And then what else can we talk about? Yeah, I want to talk about the number two most red on the Bloomberg terminal. It's about Nicola founder Trevor Milton has been found guilty of defrauding investors. He was convicted of fraud for misleading investors in the electric truck company, a stunning downfall for the door to door salesman turned billionaire who promised revolutionized the auto industry. So we got that going on, and then go, go to a little bit of way down the list a little bit to some extent at this point, to a story that just broke. It's a Dow Jones Wall Street journal story, but it says, Ruben Murdock, exploring reuniting his media empire by recombining Fox and news core. This is nearly a decade after the split. This is according to people familiar. And as we've been saying, Fox shares are down about 1.4% in the after hours, and you've got news core up about 3.5%. Big question is, what happens next week, Carol? As we talked about, we don't have as much economic data coming next week as we got this week. What housing data? A lot of housing data, but as Vince Signorella told us, with mortgage rates at 7%, we're expecting a significant slow down when it comes to purchases of new homes. No, it does start to kick into high gear, or it starts to pick up some momentum. Earnings? Yeah. Who do we hear from? Well, we've got some airlines coming out with earnings. We've got more banks. More banks on Monday. Yeah. We're going to continue to hear from some of the Fed presidents and Fed members. So we'll look for a commentary. In the meantime, let's remind everybody this was a down day for stocks for the week overall. The Dow Jones industrial average, though, did gain with a 1% or did finish up with a 1% game, but down 1 1 1 2 1 2 in the S&P for the week overall. NASA was down 3%. We should check out. Crypto IRL.

14691," you from the heart of where innovation, money and power collide. In Silicon Valley and beyond, this is Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chair. My memory Chinese and Francisco and this is Bloomberg Technology coming up the next hour. I'm going to start with Elon Musk's Starlink in focus after Elon Musk says SpaceX can't fund satellites in Ukraine indefinitely. I'll get it impact the war we'll discuss. Plus, new filing show Elon Musk is under federal investigation over his deal with Twitter or potential deal. We should say we'll talk about all this and what it means for the company's future with Twitter founding member and a former board member, Jason Goldman. And pure speculation. That is what meta is calling the FTC's antitrust concerns over a deal to buy the VR fitness company within unlimited. What a hurdle Zuckerberg will face trying to dismiss the case this hour. All of that in a moment, but first it was a brutal end of the week for markets. We're going to get the latest now with Bloomberg's Emily Grafell. Emily, what a week and what a Friday. Hi, Emily. What a week. I mean, stocks pretty much ending in the red to finish a volatile week. We saw the S&P 500 pretty much falling all day finishing down about 2.4%. This is after that one year, you Michigan inflation expectation survey rose for the first time in seven months. We saw traders ramping up expectations for how aggressive the Federal Reserve is going to be that US two-year yield topping 4.5% for the second day in a row. NASDAQ 100 underperforming and really coming under pressure in the technology space is those semi conductors. The Philadelphia semi conductors index down about 4.4%, 6% all about a lack of demand and again concerns of those rising rates. Taking a look at some of the individual movers in the S&P 500 in the stock market. Apple down about 3.2% today. It was actually the biggest contributor to the S&P 500s decline today. Twitter though, rare standout here up just a little bit about 0.2% to finish the day. This is after its reversing course after it fell yesterday on news that Twitter sought documents last week related to a federal investigation into that musk deal. And speaking of Elon Musk, let's take a look at Twitter stock falling about 7%. Today, it actually closed today 50% below its November 2021 closing high. The stock has just been absolutely crushed. We one year down about 25%. However, I looked back to how it performs since the end of 2019. It's still up about 630%. It's easy to forget about that run that Tesla has had when we look at these short-term movements. But overall, Tesla getting crushed with the rest of the stock market, Emily. Good point, Emily. Thank you for that update, Emily Graféo. Meantime, the Pentagon says it is in touch with SpaceX in regards to starling satellites in Ukraine that provide crucial broadband support in the war against Russia. This following Elon Musk's threat to cut off financial support for starling terminals in the region. He's putting pressure on other entities now to step in and make up the shortfall after costing SpaceX at least $80 million. The Pentagon says it could turn to options other than starlink. This all following an earlier to speed over Musk's public comments suggesting the government in-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2917,2022-10-14 21:06:04
14692," Million dollars, the Pentagon says it could turn to options other than Starlink. This all following an earlier to speed over, much public comments suggesting the government and keep seed territory in exchange for peace with Russia. For more on this, I want to bring in Bloomberg's at Ludlow, as well as Dr. DJ Peterson, President of Longview Global Advisors, which is advising business leaders and investors on short and long-term risks of the Russia-U crane war. Ed, I want to start with you. What exactly did Elon Musk say? And why is he saying it right now? Yeah. So in a tweet response, he basically said that he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat, a Ukrainian envoy, who had used profane language, which I won't repeat on this program, but basically said Elon Musk should take a hike for one to the better expression. And Musk said in his tweet, we're just following his recommendation. That led to a wide range of media coverage and suggestions that actually Elon Musk might pull over funding support or literally operational support for Starlink in the country. And we know, as you said end, that the Pentagon say, as of Friday, they're engaged with SpaceX over the broad issue of Starlink and the Pentagon saying that they'd have other issues. But for SpaceX, this is very much an issue of cost in terms of how Starlink is operating in that country. DJ, how crucial is Starlink to Ukraine's defenses? Emily, I think it's central to their defenses. If you think about, first of all, their ability to wage war, you think about how much they have integrated Western military gear into their operations. Well, communications is essential as well. And one of the things that Ukrainians have done much better than the Russians is actually coordinate their defense and offense across a very, very long line of contact. And so this is essential for coordination. It's essential for targeting and using the Western technology very well. If you think about a lot of this area, it's very rural. It's spread out. They're very great distances. So traditional radios might not work. As we know, the Russians have knocked out so much infrastructure. So this is crucial. And it's actually a very important leveraging factor of leveraging all this other assistance that the West is giving. Can you give us an idea, DJ, how much these satellites cost to manage and whether that resonates with what Elon Musk has said here? Right. There's a lot of this debate around the numbers. And as we saw with the Twitter deal, kind of playing loose with numbers around what is real and what is not real in the Twitterverse. So I think we do have to take these numbers with the grain of salt. Generally speaking, if you look at what has been deployed in the field already that we know is about 12,000 units, it has cost probably around 80 million to 100 million. So that number that he has put out is not too bad. I mean, when you get to these issues around, he's raised the issue of just maintaining the satellite network and cybersecurity. Well, that's a cost of doing business as a big global firm. So I'm a little bit less, I'm a little bit more skeptical of that. I think another thing we need to pay attention to. If you're looking at the cost side is obviously the Ukrainians have asked for much more in terms of these units on the ground, the transmitter units. I mean, do they need them all? Will they get them all? So that goes into say the $400 million number that SpaceX has put out. So that's an ask. It's not necessarily going to be delivered. And then finally, I want to add that we've talked about a commitment about over a year. And frankly, from my perspective, long-view global advisors take is that this war is not going to last another year. Russia has only months to fight. So it's not clear really how at this point, will they need all these all the satellite comms for an entire year? So it needs to be played out. But officials that I've talked to in the U.S. government say it's not a reasonable ask and it's not an unreasonable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2918,2022-10-14 21:10:15
14693," for an entire year. So it needs to be played out, but officials that I've talked to in the U.S. government say it's not a reasonable ask, and it's not an unreasonable left, not only for the U.S., but also for all of our allies that are supporting. So combined, I think there's a lot of countries that are be willing to contribute. Meantime, there's a report that Elon Musk spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin before he made those public tweets, public comments, that public, Twitter bull poll suggesting how Ukraine could seek peace with Russia, of course, widely criticized. Elon Musk is denying that he spoke to Putin. What do we know about this? Yeah, and categorically, Elon Musk has denied that he spoke directly to Putin about Ukraine. So on Monday of this week, Ian Bremer, who is the head of risk consultancy group Eurasia, said that he spoke to Musk about two weeks ago. He hadn't been planning on revealing what was in that conversation, but decided to, in his regular newsletter, after he saw Musk's own comments on Twitter about Ukraine, and he said that Musk had told him, Musk had told grammar, that he had spoken to Putin about the issue of Ukraine, which was controversial. So Musk denied it, but Musk went further to say that he hadn't spoken to Putin for about 18 months, which essentially predates the war of the current conflict in Ukraine. D.J., why do you imagine Musk would present this starlink issue to the public, given the controversy about whether or not he spoke to Putin and when, and given the controversy over his Twitter poll in general? Emily, that's a great question. And frankly, I find it dumb-founding. Really, Musk got into a lot of trouble politically, obviously, as well as reputationally, by making this statement about Russia. He got a lot of favorable press in Russia. Not a good thing. I also think the timing is very bad, because it's on the heels of days of massive Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure. So is he, it looks like he's, you know, he's trying to play up a situation where Ukraine's in a bind. And that's not good either. There is a deal to be had here. I think the allies are more than willing, given all that we've spent $400 million is actually not that much. There is a deal to be had here, but he's not doing, he should not be presenting himself as a global state, and as not as strength, and he is clearly screwing up on this repeatedly. All right, not missing words there. Dr. G.J. Peterson, Longview Global Advisors, President, along with our own, I'd love though, we're gonna have a little bit more on the Musk Twitter saga later this hour. Here's something else we're following. Instacart, slashing its valuation for the third time. The new valuation of about $13 billion was announced internally this week, according to sources. It was valued at most $39 billion back in March 2021. Instacart's executives reiterated the company's still intends to go public, but is waiting for market conditions to improve. Coming up, MetaRespons, to an FTC suit over its latest VR acquisition, and what it means for Zuckerberg's MetaRespon. This is Bloomberg. Instagram helps them solve the new production requisition confrontations it cares about. At that moment, it's because some traders claim they could just bond, and not work and legal demand to kind of beلام the stock market. That's a thats a great job. Still getting to feel anything else there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2919,2022-10-14 21:15:10
14694," They're good, وه? Oooh, ok... Yesss! Yesss! Eeee! Yesss! Yesss! meta is pushing back against the FTC's attempt to block its acquisition of the virtual reality app within unlimited meta arguing the FTC hasn't laid out the elements to show the deal announced in October of 2021 would actually hurt potential competition in VR fitness earlier this week Mark Zuckerberg advertised the meta versus as the future of work gaming and entertainment here to discuss Bloomberg's Alex Beringa so what precedent Alex is this feud between meta and the FTC setting? Yeah, so this is actually a move that is under the umbrella of FTC chair Lena Khan. She's taken a much more aggressive stance against big tech and this suit to block the acquisition of within this virtual reality fitness company is one of those kind of big swings she seems to be taking it. Now the latest drama Emily last week the FTC actually narrowed its argument to block the deal. Basically only leaning into this idea that the acquisition would kill potential competition in a future market. They killed the argument that the acquisition would consolidate power under meta with its beat saber app. In response to that meta is coming out this week and basically saying hey if this is the argument you're making we don't think you have enough here to actually block the deal and they're asking the judge to dismiss it. In terms of what happens next Emily the judge can rule on this and have some hearings or the hearings on the injunction could actually still go forward in December and the judge make a decision after that but either way Emily folks who watch the FTC and its antitrust actions and meta and the metaverse we paying attention to this at least through the end of the year. Why is meta so keen to buy a virtual fitness company? Yeah and I think an illustration of that Emily we saw it first hand if you were like me with an Oculus strap to your face this week. Meta had their connect product conference on Tuesday and they showed off basically all of the things they're bringing to the metaverse. Right now meta's argument to get folks living in this virtuality world is really dependent on what you can do there. They talked about video games they talked about a lot of new partners but this fitness idea they spent a number of minutes talking about it on",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2920,2022-10-14 21:19:01
14695," video games, they talked about partners, but this fitness idea, they spent a number of minutes talking about it on Tuesday. Fitness is one of the things that they said their users come in every month for and within this game, super natural is one of these fitness apps where you can have the controllers in your hand, you can have the Oculus on your face and you can move their body. So it's key to this kind of argument for them of why people need to show up to the other things. So it's a little bit more important. So they are the ones that are in the world that frankly they're spending $10 billion a year on. Now, meta reports earnings in just a few weeks. Obviously the market cap has 10 of many efforts. What are you watching for? I mean, I'm watching what investors think as you said the stock is down more than 60% since January. They are also paying their money. So that's what I'm saying. So that's what I think is the most important thing that's going to be the market and all of the social media properties. It's been a really tough year for marketing budgets. Advertisers haven't been spending as much on ads, which is where all of the social media properties make their money. So that's what I'll be paying kind of the most attention to. And frankly Emily, that is probably the thing that's going to determine how much patients investors continue to have with Mark the market. And I think that is something that, you know, hasn't really materialized this metaverse, this digital universe. All right, Bloomberg's Alex Brinca who covers social media for us.

14696," Network effects impacts all of that. If you're going to be spending your life's energy, building a startup is going to take 100% of your effort. You're trying to defend the business area that you've carved out. You might as well be working on a business that has network effects because then you'll have a shot at going the distance and making a real impact in the world and creating true value for your employees, for your investors, and for your whole network. Part of the teaser there for the venture firm NFX's Master Class on Network Effects, a new program by the venture capital firm to help startups build at scale. For more on-it-I want to bring in NFX Founding Partner James Courier James. It's kind of like a VC Master Class, if you will. What do founders get access to with this and what are you hoping they take away? Yeah, so as you know, NFX is a seed stage firm, probably the largest seed stage only firm in the world. Our mission is to help 10 million founders. We can only invest in a few hundred, but we can help them with software and with content. And the content that we've most recently released is this Master Class on Network Effects. So the name of our firm is NFX, which stands for Network Effects. But, you know, and we've done blog posts and we've done tweets. We've done other ways of sort of educating folks about what we see with Network Effects and how you use them to build the giant companies of today and the future. This Master Class is our next level product where we encapsulate about 20 years of learning about Network Effects and then bring that into three hours of video so that founders and teams, with the founders can really educate themselves quickly about this most powerful tool in building giant, important tech companies. So we mentioned companies like Facebook and Uber and, you know, even Bitcoin has been a success because of Network Effects. What are the startups that are being built now based on Network Effects that you think are going to be the next big thing? Yeah, so companies like Mammoth Bio Sciences is building a platform network effect like an operating system, really. Like a Microsoft or an iOS, but they're doing it in the biotech space. They're based in the Bay Area, recently raised it over a billion dollars. And we think, you know, Jennifer Dowd, know the Nobel Prize winner is one of the founders, this company is going to be a monster. Another company you might have heard of recently is called Incredible Health, which is run by Amman Abuzade and Rome, and they have built a marketplace between nurse labor forces and then the hospitals that hire them. So they install software in the hospitals, and then they bring the hiring to the hospitals so they can, you know, find the nurses that they're understaffed on. So many businesses both in marketplaces, platforms, as well as the ones you're talking about, like Twitter and Facebook, which have direct network effects. Because they're actually 16 different network effects, we're finding a lot of different companies that are today building a new ways of using these techniques that can create multi-billion dollar companies. And Incredible Health and Maniford too, that are our unicorns and heading on up from there. Well, we've had both Iman Abuzade and Jennifer Dowd, and on the show. So I'm glad we're on the right track. You know, we are in the middle of a massive downturn. There could be a lot farther to fall here. How concerned are you about that? And, you know, how is it impacting your investment strategy? Yeah, you know, in effect, as sort of a large a seed fund, we see across a whole bunch of different verticals, like marketplaces, Fintech, PropTech games, Biotech, Web3. We're investing across a lot of different verticals. And, but we're investing for seven to ten years from now. So in that way, we're a little bit insulated from the current market conditions and are still looking for founders with big ideas, particularly ones with network effects, because the next two to three years won't really matter for them when we invest this year, but will matter is what the market conditions are seven years from now. And what the market will value them at then? The market will decide, but in the meantime, we're looking to build, you know, 100 million of revenue, 200 million of revenue in real businesses, and we can invest now. So actually, we do feel like now is the best time in the last four years to start a company. So we're leading a...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2922,2022-10-14 21:27:40
14697," million of revenue in real businesses, and we can invest now. So actually, we do feel like now is the best time in the last four years to start a company. So we're leaning aggressively in. We lean aggressively in during COVID. We actually ran a program called Fast, where we offered one to $1 to $2 million for 15% of companies within nine days. Okay, and we touched 4,000 companies at that time right at the beginning of COVID. And now that we're in this downturn, a similar thing is happening. So does that mean you're not worried? I mean, last quick question. I mean, we're talking about Instic. We just talked about InsticArt slashing its valuation from $39 billion to $13 billion. I mean, you're seeing some huge haircuts here. We are. And those companies were seeded six, eight, 12 years ago. Our venture firms started five years ago. So we are still in the period of rapid growth for a lot of our companies. And so far, we're not affected by these huge markdowns we're seeing. And again, where we're deploying capital is for seven to 10 years from now. And most seed funds are doing that. That includes us because we're focused on that stage. All right, NFX Founding Partner, James Courier on your new VC Masterclass. Thank you for stopping by. Coming up, we're talking about what else, but the Elon Musk Twitter deal and the very latest that October 28th deadline, fast approaching Twitter, revealing that Musk was investigated by federal authorities. We're going to hear from Twitter Founding Member and former White House Chief Digital Officer, Jason Goldman. Next, this is Bloomberg. riders and emergency wearing becomes more gorgeous than attacked by heavy clouds in the Amazon 60's.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2923,2022-10-14 21:32:08
14698," to the Welcome back to Bloomberg Technology. I'm Emily Chang in San Francisco. We've got some break-it news crossing the terminal now that news corp does indeed confirm it will explore a combination with Fox Corporation, news corp saying it received letters from Rupert Murdock and his trust to that effect. There have been some reporting that Murdock was considering reuniting his media empire if you will that he split back in 2013 news corp now confirming that it will explore combining once again with Fox. Meantime, Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter has had so many twists and turns that one might forget this all started back on January 31st. That is when Musk quietly began buying Twitter shares. He since gotten a lot louder in so many ways and Bloomberg Business Week broke down Musk's tweets by the numbers joining us now for more on an in-depth look at what's been going viral all year long really as Bloomberg's at lead low. So, business week crunching the numbers here, what interesting insights did that yield? Yeah, I think first of all it's the frequency and volume of the tweets since January, I think in May we were surprised how quickly Elon Musk put the deal on hold and race his concerns about the level of bots on the platform and if we look at the chart of his weekly tweets, volume of weekly tweets, you can see that just after that deals put on hold there's kind of a big spike in the number of tweets he's making right and he's talking a lot about the concerns in particular about bots and then things go very quiet and of course just a few weeks later everything changed because Twitter sues to enforce the original terms of the deal. He tweets memes, he tweets, emojis, he tweets, polls, does he have a favorite kind of tweet? You know what's really interesting is that the overwhelming number of tweets that must send are replies and this was why everyone was so interested in this deal in the first place right? Elon Musk is one of the most active and well followed users on Twitter but it's not just him sending original tweets, it's mostly him replying to other users and we know that he engages really actively with other Tesla users, people that he is a fan of, people interested in SpaceX and you can see from that chart quite clearly that that's how he uses engagement, very few of the tweets he sent since January 31st have been retweets either. What's it in tweeting about the most? Is it Tesla? Is it Twitter? Is it SpaceX? Is it repopulating the world? You know, Em, you and I have been living this deal night and day about Elon Musk buying Twitter but actually if you break down the tweets and do the analysis he's not obsessed with Twitter, he's not tweeting a lot about Twitter. Most of it is about his other companies, Tesla, SpaceX, you know he's really engaged when SpaceX has a successful mission, he tweets a lot about Tesla, SpaceX generally is a topics high up there, EVNO surprise and you look down there actually the interesting number to me is crypto, you know he hasn't tweeted as much as one might think about crypto at least in the tweets since January 31st of this year. And you know when he has talked about Twitter, you know where does he focus? I mean there's certain tweets of course that have gotten a lot more attention than others. Well this links to that first chart, bots, he tweets a lot about the bots issue on the platform, right? He doesn't necessarily talk so much about some of the characters involved, management he does on occasion but the focus is really on bots which is one big portion of that pie chart on your screen. The other one that I find really interesting is the number of tweets about issues of censorship and bias and we know that one of the big considerations for Elon Musk is policy, right? We want to know what policy...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2924,2022-10-14 21:36:12
14699," The one that I find really interesting is the number of tweets about issues of censorship and bias and we know that one of the big considerations for Elon Musk is policy, right? We want to know what policies will change in terms of content moderation and who will be allowed on the platform or allowed back onto the platform if indeed he does go through to buy this deal. But that's to me of the four, that pie chart is certainly the most telling. All right. I'd love to. Thanks for walking through all of that for us and bringing us all the data. Joining us now to continue this conversation. Jason Goldman, one of the founding members of Twitter. Of course, he's also the former White House chief digital officer under president Obama always some good insider outsider perspective from you. Jason, you know, one of the latest developments that we haven't talked a lot about yet. There's these revelations from Twitter that Elon Musk was being investigated by federal authorities over his acquisition conduct, if you will. What do you make of this? Yeah, I mean, it's difficult to say because we don't know which federal agency was investigating. I think it's a little premature to think there's much fire there because this could be as simple as Twitter's lawyers trying to get their hands on the on the information that Elon shared with the SEC. We know that he was contacted by the SEC as a related to this deal. And so it might just have been something that they put in the filing to get information about that. So without actually finding out what kind of investigation was involved, it's a little premature to say, Oh, there's something super nutty going on here. That being said, you can never really discount the super nutty in this particular story. So what's your hunch? Does a deal happen by October 28th? Are there more surprises between now and then? I think it's again, I would never rule out more surprises. I believe a deal happens. I just don't have a ton of high conviction about it. I think what's likely happening now is that the lawyers from both sides are trying to figure out how to execute this deal in between two parties that have absolutely no reason to trust one another. And so it's how do we get all the money in one place and you show us that you have all the money and then we quickly take all the money and you get the Twitter without, you know, without involving a lot of other contingencies, which Twitter is just not going to accept at this point. So Tait Elon Musk gets the Twitter and it happens in a couple of weeks. What do you think happens to Twitter under Elon Musk and what's the biggest risk? I think the biggest risks are sort of twofold. One is I think there's going to be a lot of brain drain. I think a lot of people are going to either leave of their own volition or be fired and we'll get into why I think that's a problem for the company and the world. And then the other is I think Twitter's just going to be subject to the kind of reactive decision making that Elon has shown both publicly in his comments about the company and now privately in what we've seen from the tax to be someone who's just, you know, doesn't respond well to pushback or criticism likes to be praised, likes to be given, you know, accolades about how smart he is and what great ideas he could bring forward. And but despite all of that, just still does not have a serious plan for what to do with the platform. And I think that puts the company in a dangerous place and I think it puts its users in a dangerous place. Okay, here's a similar question in another way. What's one thing that must could do that would make Twitter better and do you think he'll do it? I think the easiest thing that he could do to make it better is to immediately remove himself from the decision making involved in it. Like if he somehow moved the company into some kind of foundation and said this is going to be running a nonprofit way, you know, actually, you know, Jack and I don't agree on a lot of things. Jack has this notion about, you know, Twitter returning to be a protocol and, you know, this notion that it needs to be just one client running on top of a technical protocol. If if Elon were to kind of divest himself of the authority and decision making power around the platform, that would be one positive thing he could do and then just leave it to actual subject matter experts still evolve the technology needed to do that. So I've been dying to know what your thoughts are on the text exchanges between Musk and Jack, you know, what was your big takeaway? I mean, of course, you had this hunch all along that they were somehow in cahoots. Yeah, I mean, I think it was pretty obvious from the proxy filing that Jack had a conversation with Elon in which he expressed his own opinion that would be better independent hands. We find out from the text the text that Jack.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2925,2022-10-14 21:40:44
14700," This is pretty obvious from the proxy filing that jacket had a conversation with Elon in which he expressed his own opinion that would be better and independent. And we find out from the text, the text that Jack, when Elon agrees to do this, the Jack is overcome with emotion that he would then say later publicly is, you know, the singular solution to Twitter's problems has shown up, you know, he was, he just couldn't believe that this, you know, Messiah had arrived to save Twitter from this board that Jack had both put together as during his 10 years running the company. But now simply couldn't stand to be in business with anymore. And so the text revealed someone, you know, and Jack who was just frustrated and pretty much done running the company and then willing to completely throw under the bus, anyone at the company, including Prague, the CEO, who got in the way of Elon coming in to take it over, despite the fact that Elon at no point to Jack either in private or in public, expressed any real idea of what he wanted to do with it. Certainly nothing that was in line with what Jack thought needed to happen. This idea of making it a protocol, that's nothing that Elon has picked up at all. So I think the text just revealed not only from Jack, but in general, just how, you know, how willing people are to appease Elon and that anyone who pushes back on him immediately gets, you know, pushed to the side. We haven't heard from the other Twitter founders of Williams and Biz Stone. You know, I know you're close with them. And I'm, what do they think about this, to the extent that you can share? Yeah, I prefer to just sort of speak for myself. I am close with the other, the founders and a number of other early employees. But I think for all of us that were there in the early time of the company, you know, we've always had self-inflicted wounds. We've always had, you know, periods of turmoil with the company. I think despite differences in terms of like, oh, you know, I didn't think Jack should be CEO and then Jack didn't think that I should be CEO and that was a big rift in the company. I never really doubted, for example, Jack's willingness to do what was necessary to make Twitter a better product or an order that I doubt that he had true conviction and passion about how Twitter should grow into the world. What we're seeing now though is just someone who, who doesn't have that kind of expertise. We're seeing instead someone who's been told by everyone who's blowing up his text messages in the world writ large that he's the second coming of Thomas Edison. He's a genius who can enter any problem, and despite a lack of subject matter expertise, he's going to be able to fix these very difficult problems. And that's dangerous. That's dangerous for the geopolitical reasons that you talked about at the top of the show. That you're talking about someone who is incredibly susceptible to flattering influence and believes too highly in his own abilities. And that's going to create the context for a large mistake to happen. Whether that's, you know, shutting off access in Ukraine or that inadvertently or purposely revealing user data to an authoritarian state that's trying to get information about dissidents who are coordinating on Twitter. Remember, Twitter's never really had a problem with China because Twitter doesn't exist in China. But Elon exists in China. Tesla exists in China. So now China has an incredibly strong lever over Elon in order to jeopardize user safety and jeopardize dissidents in Hong Kong or Taiwan or wherever else. That's a real problem. And it doesn't require a secret conversation between Elon and Putin. It's just obvious on his face that he's going to be susceptible to these kind of pressures. Quickly, how concerned are you about this all happening right before a midterm election? You know, especially given your time with the Obama administration? I'm not too concerned about the midterms. I think it's too close to the midterms to be a problem. I think for future election cycles, not just domestically, but around the world, I think it is a concern because not so much for putting the thumb on the scale for a particular political party. And I don't think Trump should be on Twitter, but I also kind of discount how important that is. I think it's more of a problem that around the world, we know, as you know, the Washington Post said, that autocrats already used the platforms to spread lies about opponents in whip up violence and mail them. And that's a problem because Elon's going to be able to tip the scales for those kind of forces around the world. Jason Goldman, one of the founding members of Twitter, the former White House Chief Digital Officer, always good to hear your thoughts. Jason, thank you for stopping by. Coming up, the crypto exchange that just raised 165 million in a downturn. Conversed with president Paul",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2926,2022-10-14 21:45:20
14701," It's good to hear your thoughts, Jason. Thank you for stopping by. Coming up, the crypto exchange that just raised 165 million in a downturn, you just watched COO Mary Katherine later with us next. To tell us more, this is Bloomberg. profitable. Can we count? The Crypto Exchange Uniswap has just raised $165 million in a series of funding round led by Polychain Capital. This value is the company at $1.66 billion. Uniswap says it's one of the largest funding rounds for a crypto firm since the market downturn earlier this year, even as the crypto market is still struggling and some of the investors are starting to lose confidence in D5. Uniswap COO, Mary Catherine later joins us now. So, Mary Catherine, what is it you think about Uniswap that, you know, got investors to pay up, given these very difficult market conditions? Thanks. Well, thanks for having me on. I think what we've learned in the past six months in crypto is we've seen the importance of decentralized systems at the core of some of this new technology and also the importance of safety and security. And Uniswap has been committed to safety and security since day one and never takes custody of user funds. We are a decentralized, decentralized trading protocols and then products on top of them that essentially are, I mean, that you're not managing actual assets, you're not managing users assets, you're giving them open source technology and then web and mobile applications to access that technology. So, I think what's really different about Uniswap is again, it's a fundamentally different technology stack from a centralized exchange. It's a novel innovation, completely new technology, whereas the crypto firms that you saw suffer over the past six months are those that are really using traditional tech stacks, traditional centralized exchange models, ultimately, had risk management failures. And so, I think that in our investors recognize and the market recognize that decentralized product sellers it's their whole kind of blockchain Ling but a reinstateproduct krall",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2927,2022-10-14 21:49:49
14702," traditional centralized exchange models, ultimately, had risk management failures. And so I think that in our investors recognized and the market recognized that decentralized protocols have unique advantages that not only can benefit crypto markets, but also traditional markets more broadly, and that Uniswap Labs is really committed to, as I mentioned, security, but also bringing more and more users into the space because the entire ecosystem and market needs to grow and again needs to be more accessible, easier to use, and safer in order for that to happen. What do you think this says about the popularity of decentralized projects in crypto over the longer term? Well, I hope that the benefits of the decentralized protocols will become recognized and that will have, again, more products that make it easier to use. Today, it's still a little bit too cumbersome. It's too hard to explain what are the benefits of the decentralization, what are the benefits of being able to have different custody models, the transparency, the lower cost that come with decentralized technology as a structure. It's a lot to explain. And so what we're focused on for the next several years with this funding is making it easier and more accessible for more retail users, but also even traditional investors and pools of capital to access the technology and realize its benefits. So I think it's an endorsement of the fundamental innovation in the technology and in decentralized finance. But again, when it's being built by teams that really understand the importance of security and simple use of experiences? There's still a concern about security. Why have there been so many hacks in DeFi and how do we prevent those in the future? Yeah. Well, just as with any financial system or technology, there are course risks that need to be managed. Some of those are technical. So having audited code is critical. We have multiple audits, multiple third party audits of all of our code. It's a key part of deploying smart contracts. And so I think that's a best practice that in an open source sort of open garden where people can just launch new technology, they don't necessarily, not all projects necessarily go through those same controls. So that's a key part of that technical risk. There's also an element of just having a security mindset of anticipating all the different things that can go wrong, both in anything that's a financial transaction and also in deploying smart contracts. When you deploy a smart contract to a blockchain, it's effectively permanent. It's effectively immutable. And so the level of battle testing in advance of that is huge. And not all projects treat deployment as a final commitment. And so it means that sometimes people are launching projects and users may access them and not realize the risks that they're taking. So I think that we're going to see a whole new level of security and safety expectation among users and cautiousness. And so winning users' trust, earning their trust, earning their business is going to become more and more important because unfortunately many people have been burned. But that is in the context of DeFi where many of the risks are, like the technical. Over the past six months, many of the large crypto challenges and failures had been failures of risk management. Had been traditional financial services style failures of not managing users funds accurately. And I think that it's really important that people understand those companies, Celsius and the like, we're not using the technology that we use, for example. They were traditional models. We're frankly, they mismanaged their users' assets. So it's very important we just aggregate those risks. The financial risk management that is critical for those companies that do touch users' funds unlike us and then also the technical risks. All right, Mary Catherine later, COO of UNISFOP. Thanks for sharing your perspective here and telling us more about that funding. Coming up a verdict in the trial against Nikola Founder, Trevor, Milton. And we'll break it all down for us. This is for her.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2928,2022-10-14 21:53:29
14703," And Gilti, that is the verdict from a jury in the fraud trial against Nicola Fownder Trevor Milton. Let's bring back I'd love to have been following this case every step of the way Ed, you've been in the courtroom. Tell us a little bit more about the verdict today. Yes, Trevor Milton was found guilty on one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud. It's important to note that he was found not guilty on the most serious count of securities fraud, which would carry a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. But this was an astonishing case. It went on for a month and essentially what the government proved was that Trevor Milton lied, made misleading statements and exaggerations about the company's technology. It's progressed, it's order book, but crucially that those statements had pushed investors, retail investors in particular, to buy the stock. That is the burden of proof that was on the government and the jury returned an astonishingly quick verdict on Friday. Right, why do you think the jury returned it so quickly? It's impossible to say, I mean, it has been a one month trial that there was a pause for around 10 days because some of the defence council got COVID, frankly. But one juror that Bloomberg spoke to leaving the court simply said the evidence was clear that the government presented a number of witnesses, many Nicola employees, present employees, people that were there at the time, documentary evidence, appearances from Trevor, text messages. The defence's argument was very simple that basically Trevor genuinely believed that what he was saying was true. He never set out to defraud everyone and that everyone around him at the company was saying the same thing. If investors really looked at regulatory filing documents, they would have found the information that should have informed their decision anyway. So it's been a very busy long trial, but five hours, that's a very quick verdict. Interesting. And you've made the point that the defence argued, he didn't lie, he just maybe over-promised and said what he believed to be true, which is something that is maybe kind of common into looking valley, so it'll be interesting to see how this impacts the tech industry more broadly. I'd love to thank you for your excellent reporting on this case. That does it for this edition of Bloomberg Technology coming up next week.

The great sci-fi art of the mid 20th century teased the vision of the future with one,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2930,2022-10-14 22:02:02
14705," The Great Sci-fi Art of the mid-20th century teased the vision of the future with one distinct element and common, a life for humans in outer space. Whether vacationing on an exotic new planet or commuting to the moon for business, space travel seemed like it was just around the corner. Yet here we are, a half century later, and only about 500 human beings have ever left the bounds of Earth's atmosphere. But thanks to a set of ambitious private companies betting on the promise of space tourism, that long-awaited future could be here sooner than we think. For most of the history of spaceflight, governments have been the prime force behind nearly every aspect, from planning to funding to cruise selection. But as early as the 1980s, proposals for commercial space tourism began to emerge, along with innovative solutions for getting people there, such as the wild concept of sticking a 74-person passenger cabin in the cargo bay of a NASA space shuttle. Although various non-astronauts have been selected for missions over the years, true space tourism didn't happen until 2001. When an entrepreneur named Dennis Tito coughed up an estimated $20 million to hitch a ride with the Russian Federal Space Agency for a week-long vacation aboard the International Space Station. Twenty years later, we're seeing a new contender in this final frontier of tourism, private companies. It's becoming a private enterprise situation, still very high risk with the high-reward, potential reward. But, you know, government is really out of the business of flying people now, and it's really going to be companies like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that do that heavy lifting. Global space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut, the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight, so you get a short amount of microgravity experience, and you can float and take some photos. And then you come back. This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this. There are multiple companies that want to get to the place where they fly people into space. The first of these is Blue Origin, founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos. Using the autonomous rocket system New Shepherd, a tribute to the first American in space, Blue Origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time, offering a rarefied treat of 62 mile high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness. Foking officially kicked off in May 2021, with the very first seat to be auctioned off for charity. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism. Aiming for a launch in 2022, once Richard himself has taken flight. I'm hoping to be able to go to space. I'd love to be able to coincide with the moon landing and go to space. So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far, including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least $250,000 or roughly $50,000 for each of the five minutes or sub-weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies' offerings aim to make suborbital flight a regular form of adventure travel, eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities and billionaires. The third major contender is Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has set its sights even higher on orbital flights, which are... A whole other level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suborbital, if you're just going to go up above the von Karman line, which is 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, you only need to get up to maybe 5,000 miles an hour to get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down. You don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from an orbital. So when you go orbital, I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship. You've got to go 17,500 miles per hour, not just 5,000 miles an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. By doing that, SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4.

14706," And that's what they're doing with the Inspiration 4. Visit Inspiration4.com for your chance to go to space. Inspiration 4 is the first planned all-civilian mission into orbit, slated to launch in late 2021. The crew will bring their own set of diverse perspectives and backgrounds and experiences to test how a group of different people, namely people who aren't professional astronauts, could affair in space. Until now, astronauts have had to be physically perfect. And this mission is changing that. And so I feel incredibly honored to be representing those who aren't physically perfect. At H-10, I was diagnosed with bone cancer. And I was treated at St.G. Children's Research Hospital. And I spent a year there undergoing intense chemo and also surgery that ultimately saved my leg. I now work at St. Jude as a PA, a physician assistant, and I work with leukemia and lymphoma patients. The kids we work with are so brave. And they are very excited to watch me go to space because this is showing them that they're capable of doing this as well. Haley, along with three other crew members, will spend three days in space orbiting the Earth every 90 minutes, a four landing back off the coast of Florida. Well, when you think about access, the first astronauts for the United States came from the test pilot side. And so women weren't allowed to be a part of that. We have somebody in their 20s, somebody in their 30s, somebody in their 40s, and somebody in their 50s. And so there can be access in all kinds of way, whether you're talking about age, whether you're talking about gender, whether you're talking about race and ethnicity, and all of those things. The first time people are going up into space and not sent there by a superpower, like the United States or Russia or China, well, that's like really significant. And you've got to be very thoughtful about it. The whole game plan right now is to make space like really affordable and accessible for everybody. So you can have fishing buddies going to space someday, but the first is special. And so with that, we wanted to have a crew selection process that could make space available to everyday people. Getting to space is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024. Their $2 billion project called AxStation would become the first free-flying private international space station or to use a more consumer-friendly term, a space hotel. Axiom isn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Big low-error space has been building what they call expandable habitat technology, like their B330, an inflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. There's even one attached to a national space station right now they've been testing it. And you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it. And it seems to be working very, very well. This is likely to be the first kind of tourist hotel that you're gonna see up in space. First of all, it's easy to carry. Instead of this giant tin can, with all of that, the inflatable sort of lighter. You can just blow them up and they get a nice big size for about less than half the weight probably. But even if space missions become accessible to civilians. The risks of going to space are incredibly high. And you could die a thousand ways that we can think of and a thousand other ways that we can't think of. This is Michelle Hanlon. She's a space lawyer at the Mississippi School of Law focused on protecting humans in outer space. Now I'm not in the turning for any of the space tours, so I haven't been privy to their private contracts, but I can tell you that the FAA requires certain waivers to be in those contracts. So for example, the FAA says, well, we're not going to make your spacecraft to a certain safety level. We are going to make you spacecraft operator. Make sure that you inform your space tours of all of the hazards that you know of. That I imagine a very long waiver all the ways you can die in space. And you have to understand that there's health risks and you have to indemnify the US government if you are launching a United States. So those are things that we know a space tourist has to sign and has to wait. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tours space flight participants.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2932,2022-10-14 22:11:09
14707," has to sign and has to wave. So now let's go back and think about our space flight participants. The FAA calls space tourists space flight participants. They don't call them astronauts. Why is that important? If you're not an astronaut, there's no obligation to rescue you. If something goes wrong, it's a lot of money to set up a rescue launch. If it can even be done, it's something really important to think about and that difference as we cross this threshold from having astronauts in space to having real people like me in space. And when we are able to make it to space reliably enough, there's still a host of other legal and ethical issues to consider before space tourism can truly take off. There are so many gaps in space law that we are going to have to put in a lot of sort of basement ideas. And so for example, the outer space treaty is a treaty that offers principles and guidelines for state activities, for the activities of national governments. It doesn't talk about private entities, doesn't talk about humans in space. So now if something goes wrong, so let's think about all the times hotels on Earth are sued, right? So slip and false. You step on something in the bathroom. You sue the hotel and it becomes a private lawsuit. Because of the vagaries of international law, if something happens in space, well, boy, you can sue the state that launched your spacecraft, you can sue the company that brought you there, you can sue the hotel, you can sue the individual, you can sue every government related to that because the way it would be outer space treaty and the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about suing an accordive law. And so every single slip and false in a space hotel is a diplomatic nightmare. And so we really need to figure that out before we start sending a lot of people there. You think about human rights in space. Here we don't think about a human rights oxygen because it's kind of all around us and free. It's not in a space hotel. So what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person, it may be there two or three years without coming back to Earth? So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on Earth. Space hotels, I think they garnered a lot of headlines and a lot of news. But at the same time, that's not the first thing that you're going to see happen. They don't offer the compelling business case. I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or some type of filament or fiber optic cables and other things that you can do at microgravity. The things that are actually a high value finished good, when you get that back to Earth and you sell it for a very, very huge profit margin, that's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having a real estate platform that you sell to a tourist, a space hotel. It's really interesting and it will probably happen, but it's not likely to be at the forefront of space commerce. Space hotels are right around the corner. Don't get too excited about booking a trip in one. It's not a cheap ticket to ride to space and it's going to be, you know, millionaires and billionaires and that sort. But at the same time, you know, the point was made that in the early days of airline trips, that was also a completely on affordable ticket for most people. Those people who flew were people of means and over time it becomes affordable to the masses. And I think that's the goal for all the entrepreneurs in space as well, to get those costs down to a point where it's not $10 million or $5 million or $300,000 right into sub-orbitable space when it becomes more light buying a first-class ticket to go to Europe from the United States. So that's the goal and you know, the question is, can we get to that point? Given the immense operating cost of getting to space, it may be years, if ever, until space tours and becomes a profitable venture for any of these companies.

14708," Verging Galactic, the only publicly traded company of the three, has had a particularly rocky year, initially riding on the momentum of a SPAC deal. But more recently beset by launched delays and major funders, including Branson himself, selling large quantities of their stock in the company. Space is really, really, really hard, and it's an absolutely Shay, but it's one that happens to be very true. It's just really hard to do. That's also the reason that you've seen the delays that, you know, Virgin had talked about flying years and years ago, and it became such a crazy point that Richard Branson actually stopped talking about it when he was asked because it was never going to be when he predicted. But it's not insurmountable and, you know, investors have stepped up because this is something that is doable. Despite the astronomical dangers and costs of getting to space, it may ultimately follow the course of other once fanciful modes of travel. Right, brothers, having, you know, what was by modern standards a very unimpressive first flight, you know, at Kitty Hawk, I mean, you know, you had like less than 20 years later, you had your first airborne ambulances being used to to save lives. Fundamentally, the world is a more interesting place when people can go and dance among the stars and such. The lure of space is innate. It's in our DNA. It's that exploration bug. We are an exploratory species and we want to go out there and see what's out there. The vision that I had in 1969 of seeing normal human beings travel into space, it's finally beginning to happen. When you get a bunch of people up there and they can all see it for themselves, that'll create even yet another revolution in how we treat our planet and what we think about it. So while 2001 came and went without quite looking like Stanley Kubrick's ultimate space fantasy, 2021 might finally be the year we're catching up. If you visit California, you might be inclined to go to Disneyland. We're jumping you're convertible and take highway one up the coast. We may be making pilgrimage to Yosemite. All very fine choices. But if you're the kind of person who revels in our planet's extremes, then it's Route 395 that you're after. This one glorious road will carry you from Death Valley's desert floor to sky high views of Mount Whitney. You can see the 5,000 year old bristle cone pines, the oldest living organisms. Or the bizarre two fatowers of Mono Lake. And true to California's boom and bust spirit, you can santa around the ghost hound of Bodhi. What a novel experience to find an empty American city where all the businesses are shut down. To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide.

14709," To do 395 upright, it helps to have a guide. And mine is a man named Jan. And his crew. Aaron? Let's do it. And Lemmy, the hardest partying dog of all time. Jan agreed to show me some of what 395 has to offer. But only if we agreed not to disclose any locations. My name is Jan Swarostra. I'm an industrial designer out of LA. And I spend a lot of time camping and a lot of time in the Eastern Sierra. It's a place I love. And sometimes I'm known as 395 North, because this, yep, my Instagram account. And I don't like to be known as that. But I'm trying to use it to set a good example and do more with it than just social media. Wait a minute, we had a cab. But we got here, laylize. I wasn't sure where we are. This is BLM land on the outskirts of National Forest. And it's one of my favorite places in the world. Basically, everything outdoors wrapped into one. Do they have a California, do they? Oh, man. We have so much National Forest in public land that you can literally just cruise out and find a place to camp. It's ours. What I wish was mine is Jan's sweet truck. It's a 2019 Ford Ranger. Has about 200 watts of solar in it and a fridge and has everything that an RV has, except for a toilet. But just on a smaller, simple scale. You drive us around day to day in LA. Yep. And then just roll out when you want. It's my daily driver. Handles great. And then when I'm done with work, I can just bail and go camping. So the camper basically has only what I need. Think of it as backpacking with a car. The fridge has a couple compartments. This is just a kitchen box. Stove, utensils, and a bunch of stuff. This one has just dry food. And when you get inside, there's the bed. The bed flips up so you've got tons of room in here. Miss Alany. Miss phenomenon. You want to pull that over? That's pretty cool. We just popped that up. Sort of. So home on wheels. Yeah. This is my vacation house. Yeah, it's so nice, man. Even with his nomad lifestyle, Jan faces the same big question as the rest of us. Through the internet and smartphones, have to ruin everything. When you find the super special, beautiful spots is that you bust out a map and like, look at where it might be cool to go or is it worth a mouth and just getting to know people on the locals. If I see a dirt road, I just want to go down there. So a lot of it's just aimless rambling. It's a desire to just see something. Check that out. For some reason, it's more fulfilling than getting a recommendation from somebody. Or there's tons of apps and websites now. Road trip apps, camping apps, they've proliferated. The knowledge is accessible on the internet, right? I used to fight the geotags and I would get really pissed off. Like, why are you posting this place? It's going to blow up, it's going to get trashed. Now I've realized that you can't fight it. The internet has just shrunk the world. So we're not going to stop it. We're not going to stop people from going there. So I'm a lot more focused in conversation now with trying to set a good example. When you go, pick up your trash. When you're pooping out in the wilderness, don't leave your toilet paper on the top. Make sure you follow good steps for leaving no trace.

We all took in the night sky and knocked back a couple of drinks. Like that apocalypse. The thing about good times in serenity in 2020 is that they're fleeting at best. After we split up from Jan and continued on our way, smoke started to envelop us. The plus side was that our RV no longer smelled like feet. The downside was breathing. A man David here suggested that we try and outflank the smoke by cutting through Yosemite without a reservation we had to talk our way in. Uh yes, no stopping, no getting out. Yeah, no problem. We just wanted to get through. It was a beautiful choice. I'd we got out of the smoke. Whoa! But not quite as effective as we had hoped. Just four and four hours or so and we had managed to trade the smoky majesty of Yosemite for the smoky, um, look at it. Strip malls of the Central Valley. We have made it sort of out of the smoke all the way across Yosemite National Park and here to the gorgeous Central Valley of California. We're off to see a kind of surprising tech startup that is making some pretty strange machines to serve all the growers out in this region. And where we're going to wear here in this near Fresno, this is California farm country, right? We're just out the Fresno town called Kingsburg so we're right in the Central Valley of California, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The Central Valley stretches out over about 20,000.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2936,2022-10-14 22:28:07
14711," Yeah, very, very large farming valley here. It's kind of considered the bread basket of the world. The central valley stretches out over about 20,000 square miles. And the farmers here produce about one fourth of the food that Americans eat, including a whole lot of fruits and nuts. Tell me a little bit of the background of God's. I know some of this is like a family business. The roots of this go back a ways. Tell me kind of like how we got. So what's essentially like a startup, I guess? Yeah, definitely. So the founder of our company is Dave Crinklaw. And he started the business back in 1982. He started with his, basically, with his dad was commercial spraying of trees and vineyards. Got to the point where our biggest challenge was labor. Just the shortage of it, really. He was forced into innovating. And he had had this idea for quite some time about doing a driverless sprayer. And it finally got to the point where he said, you know what, I either got to get out of this business or I'm going to innovate. Organic or not, crops need to be sprayed. And this process has to take place a few times a year. This means hiring a lot of people to work long hours under serious pressure. And so just like the tech bros to the north, Gus decided to solve all of its problems with robots. On this labor points, you guys have set this up where you can have somebody in a truck and that one person can monitor, I think, eight of these. In order to operate Gus, you have one guy or girl that sits in a pickup and they monitor from a laptop computer. So that person is basically just watching all the vehicles on the screen. They can monitor up to eight of them at a time while they're out there spraying and orchard. And so that user interface really provides them with all the information they need to make sure that the machines are safe and that they're doing the correct job. So it tells them what speed they're driving, the engine RPM, the amount of gallonage per acre that they're applying at any given time. So if any one of the machines has an issue, it's going to send an alert to that laptop. Much like a self-driving car, these beasts use GPS, LiDAR, and cameras to see and navigate the world around them. They also rely on pre-built maps of the orchards for extra guidance. Gus builds the machines right here and then takes them out for robot training on this orchard next door. It's here that the company learns if the machines will behave and do as their software and human master's command. So this is kind of like the test orchard where you guys put it through the pace and it has to work on the technology. Yeah, so this is our test orchard right here. It's right by our building, so you can see in the background. So every new machine as it comes off the assembly line, it's put through a commissioning test right here. We test all the sensors on the machine, autonomous computer, all the safety systems, make sure it's doing what it's doing, fire to when it's delivered to a customer. So what's it doing now? So right now he's doing a test spray. So he's just turning the water on to make sure that the system comes up to pressure. Spraying water out of the nozzle is just to make sure it's all functioning properly. Okay. It's got like a crazy turbine at the backer. Yeah, so it's basically just a big fan. Okay. And that fan's driven off of the Cummins diesel motor and it just basically creates a big air flow. Gus is already selling these vehicles to brave modern farmers. And people the world over have taken notice of its machines. And have you just sold them in the Central Valley or like throughout the US or even overseas? Or where are they going? Yeah, so right now the majority of our machines are here in California in the Central Valley. However, we do have machines and customers in Florida and the citrus industry over there as well as Australia. And I think you start selling them in like December of 2019? Yeah, so we started taking orders early last year for the sprayers. And the first delivery we made were in December of 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2937,2022-10-14 22:32:41
14712," 2019. Okay. And how much do they cost each? So our retail price on these machines is $285,000. So it's like it's not a small investment, but I'm sure the regular sprayers aren't. Yeah, I mean we're honestly not too far away from conventional equipment on our price. And the main thing is that the return on investment is very, very quick due to all the labor savings and the increased efficiency. I mean these machines, they just, they just thrive. But basically what we're doing besides this machine, this is our first machine we call it orchard guss mainly designed for your nut trees as well as citrus and fruit. In the future we're working on a few other projects. We're going to do more machines. One of them is actually a vineyard sprayer. Okay. Vineyards are much tighter spacing. So the machine has to be physically smaller. And then we've got our eyes on doing a lot of other innovating. That right there friends is a central valley farmer putting his whole fruit basket on the table. Gary's TED Talk can't be far off. And with that it was time to get back in the RV. And to confront what happens when three men are bested by their own failings and the forces of entropy. Next on Hello World we cruise into the Mojave Desert in search of a lunar lander. We have instruments that we are going to deliver to the South Pole of the Moon in December 2022. Instruments that are trying to scan the surface of the moon. And hang with a test pilot who walked away from this. Meet Betty. She lives by herself. But for the last few months she hasn't been alone. Ella Kew tell me a joke. Did you hear about the claustrophobic castor nut? No. Apparently he just needed a little space. Most technology isn't made for 93 year olds. But this woman is making sure that this particular robot is. Ella Kew, who are you? She's researching the way we interact with machines. And if she has her way, robots will soon be a trusted companion for all of us. My name is Ella Kew. How can I help you? As technology replaces old jobs, it's also creating new ones. I'm Aki Ito and I'm here to show you the jobs of the future. My name is Danielle Ishak and I am a human robot interaction researcher. It's really hard to intuitively design a robot meant for a consumer audience. You have to make sure that it's a robot that people want. People know how to use and people value. Danielle works for an Israeli startup called Intuition Robotics. It's US offices here in downtown San Francisco. Hello. Hey Danielle, it's Aki. The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2938,2022-10-14 22:36:35
14713," The company is funded by a couple big names like Samsung and Toyota. Full disclosure, Bloomberg's venture capital arm is an investor too. This is Ellie Kieu. Can I take her out for a spin? Please? Ellie Kieu. Tell me what you can do. I am a proactive social robot designed for older adults. I can connect you to your family and friends and even play music. These features might remind you of the Amazon Echo, but you'd be missing the point if you compared her to a smart speaker. She's not meant to just be useful. She's meant to be a companion. Why don't you take a break and have a drink? And that's why she has a head that can nod and make other subtle gestures you might expect from a pet. Through our research with older adults, we're finding that almost on a daily basis. We see that somebody tells her that they love her or that they like her. Or that they miss her. Literally, I love you. They'll also tell her I'm depressed or I'm lonely. They'll open up to her in a way that they might not necessarily open up to a human because they don't feel like they'll be judged. Ellie Kieu is an on sale yet. But a prototype is already in the homes of about a dozen early testers who live in the Bay Area. Ellie Kieu, tell me what the weather is today. Danielle's job is to figure out what's working and what's not. Sorry, please rephrase your request. And she does that by visiting each of her testers twice a month. How important are these visits to your job? They're critical. We're building a product for people who we are not. I'm not a senior. And how could you know how to design for somebody if you don't do research? Because otherwise you would just be designing in the dark. Jobs like Danielle's are just starting to emerge. Until recently, robots were mostly in factories separated from humans. But now they're finally getting cheap enough, small enough, and smart enough to be in our homes. This has created a whole new challenge of designing robots that people will actually want to interact with. And that's where Danielle comes in. Her research has helped shape every little facet of Ellie Kieu, from the way Ellie Kieu moves to the way she talks. It's a very special job and it could be really hard and it could be really frustrating about that end of the day. It's incredibly rewarding. And I think the most rewarding part about it is when I see the joy on the user's faces, like that they saw their feedback turned into something real. Today, we've driven east of San Francisco to go see one of Danielle's research participants. Ellie Kieu, tell me something interesting. Did you know that Ronald Reagan was a lifeguard in high school and saved 77 people's lives? Now, see, this is where a conversation is. She should open up and I should say, no, I did not know that. I expect her to be able to continue a conversation for at least a couple of comments. Yeah. And why is that? Why? Because that's companionship. When Betty was around Danielle's age, she was working with some of history's very first computers. When I was finishing up my master's degree, I was working at Harvard in the computer lab when they were building Mark IV. A large room size computer. But now, this artificial intelligence stuff is amazing. Ellie Kieu? Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2939,2022-10-14 22:41:05
14714," L.A.Q. Yes. Schedule a doctor's appointment. No problem. I'm working on it. When Danielle brought along the idea of working with robotics for the elderly, I said, are you kidding me? Will older people connect to a robot? And she said, I don't know. Let's research and find out. Danielle grew up here in this suburb of Atlanta. Her parents spent much of their childhoods in Israel and met in the U.S. We as immigrants, we understood that we might need to work a little harder. In fact, I feel that rather than taking away from Danielle, it gave her so much more. Because she understood the fact that you need to run after your dreams and work really hard, no matter what the challenges are. The school didn't come easily for Danielle. I have dyslexia and that very much affected my self-esteem academically. The principal of the school did not recommend her to take the entrance classes. She fought for it and she got into it and she did very well with them too. Danielle's first job out of grad school was at X. The secretive research facility founded by Google. It's known for dreaming up all kinds of wacky, far-flung ideas. Can you tell us about the moonshot she worked on? No, I can't tell you too much about the projects that I worked on. I can't say that I was working on robotics. She loved the job, but wanted to work on something that would reach real consumers sooner. So she left X after a year and joined intuition robotics. She's been working in the field for four years now and it took her a while to find her footing in a male-dominated industry. I've gone to different meetups where I'll be like a circle of men with their like zip up jacket with their like company logo on it and a beer in their hand. I'm not coming in with lipstick and nobody wants to talk to me. This is my closet. So at first she did her best to fit in, wearing a pair of glasses she didn't need and toning down her style. So what's the kind of thing you used to wear to a conference? Stuff like this, blousey things. That make you look like you're 40. But that got old after a while. And what's the kind of thing you wear now? It's like I just enjoy being kind of expressive and playful and what I wear. Before we wrap up for the day, Danielle has one more LEQ tester to visit. Joseph is 97 and he's had the robot in his home for eight months. How are you? I'm fine. How are you? Good. How has Miss LEQ been? She always tells me to take a drink of water at least four times a day. So we added a whole bunch of new facts to LEQ. Did you know that a cup of chopped red bell pepper contains more vitamin C than an orange? Okay. What did you think of that? Certainly the print was, I could see that quite clearly. What about this? Well, I can see that. Now the cue, play music. No problem. It will begin shortly. By 2050, almost half a billion people are going to be 80 or older.

14715," If you're like the estimated 74% of adults in the US who use YouTube, this might be what your home screen looks like. An algorithmically curated look into what you like to watch. Maybe some tips on how to prepare a new meal or your favorite vloggers latest video. But if you're a parent who shares your phone with your children, it probably looks a little more like this. Kids content on YouTube is huge. Views for videos can reach into the billions. Five of the top 10 videos in all of YouTube's history are either music videos or kids videos, but baby shark having more views than people on the planet. YouTube has created a revolution, not an evolution, in the way kids and families consume video content, and that extends then into how they view toys and play and all of the associated things that go with that. Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys, and for toy makers who embrace the platform, it led to record success. I think Eloise the prize on question is the biggest phenomenon that has ever happened in toy industry. This is the story of how YouTube changed kids toys. Play patterns, the way children play is timeless. But how we deliver on those play patterns through product and how we market that to children has changed quite a bit over the years. And I would say that the last five to ten years really ranks right up there with the 1950s when TV commercials directed to children was first launched by Mattel. This is Nancy's Wears. She led the Barbie brand during the 90s and spent four years as the chief marketing officer for Spin Master. It used to be that there would be a few play things that parents would bring into the home where that children would create themselves like a stick and a ball becomes a play thing. And the industry was at a certain level of volume at that point. Mattel was very innovative and actually put the first product on TV and advertised it to children. Let's play home. This created a huge explosion in the toy industry that unfolded across decades. Here's a hit of the day when you're ready to play. Everyone knows this thing. Here he comes, here he comes. Greatest toy you've ever been. And his name is Mr. Machine. Here I go, here I go fighting man for it to go on the land of the T.I.S. Be there. When you go back to the 1980s, what do you think of in terms of hit shows? You think of things like masters as a universe. You think of the original Transformers and Care Bears. The joke was they were 22-minute commercials. Just close your eyes and care. Let's make a TV show which is really promotion for our property or IP to help sell toys. There were a lot of those famous characters in which kids absolutely loved it. They were totally entertained but there were huge toy lines behind them. This is Jim Silver, a 37-year veteran of the toys industry. In 1999 he started a consumer toy review magazine called Toy Wishes. And now he's the CEO of an influencer talent management group, TTPM. Regulations changed through the years and also parents became aware that they were purely commercials. And you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney Channel and Nickelodeon. They realized that wouldn't work anymore. But to them entertainment came before licensing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2941,2022-10-14 22:51:59
14716," purely commercials and you saw a lot of the new channels, the Disney channel and the colodeon, they realized that wouldn't work anymore and to them, entertainment came before licensing. What happened over time was that toys started to become designed for a 30 second commercial. Closed at some mild amount of toolbox, open at some micro machine USA. Cruiser mini micro machine vehicles planes opposed to the police station, the marine of the mini motorcycle repair shop, the gas station, the construction office, work the real working garbage, highway, passenger weapon garage doors. So if you couldn't explain it in a 30 second commercial, cost reduce it out of the product and just stick with what you could say and features of toys, magical features using electronics, lights and sounds and mechanical movements that magic, like they don't know how it happens, that became more and more important. The sound of power is heard. See you, Batman. That man's turbo-powered that mobile flies into high gear. Since 2000 with cable channels dedicated to kids, Disney channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers every day of the week and so the toy industry has continued to grow. The toy industry for the most part was a pretty solid business, just growing a couple percent a year here and there. There'd be big, big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie, like a Star Wars movie come out, you know, drive a lot of toy sales. From 2014 to 2019, the global toy industry would grow by 15 percent. At about the same time, those major cable networks of Nickelodeon, Disney channel and Cartoon Network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of Toys R Us, as both parents and kids discovered and bought more toys online. If you think about kids, they're usually the first adopters of a new medium. Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to. They were watching things on YouTube. YouTube started in early 2005 and this was like the very early web 2.0 this beginning of sort of like what was the time was the manager of generated content. Web blogging was really big. My space was the biggest thing on the internet back then. There was an early video of a Brazilian soccer legend doing stunt tricks that just when it exploded on the site, one of the first viral videos, crazy Sunday if you remember that SNL short. You remember those early viral hits? YouTube in the early days was definitely comedy and music. It was a place of experimentation. I was the chief audience officer at Maker Studios. I oversaw essentially the creator partnerships and all over the world. Maker Studios was one of the largest multi-channel networks on YouTube and had partnered with some of the biggest YouTube channels of the time before being sold to Disney in 2014. Chris is now the CEO of Pocketwatch, which represents some of the largest kids stars on YouTube, including Ryan's world and Love Diana, who can amass over a couple billion views every month. The truth is one of the very biggest and earliest videos on all of YouTube is by a creator and star named I Justine, where she unboxed her first mobile phone bill for her brand new iPhone. It came in a box. This ultimately morphed into many different formats associated with unboxing and tech was actually really big. Those became fairly successful pretty early on on the platform. You saw them expand from tech products to beauty products and then around 2012 and 2013, which are just explosion in the toys. So here's the Furby inside right here. We used to call them handschannels. And a handschannel was literally a top-down view of someone's hands unboxing typically a toy. And they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Scrooge. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2942,2022-10-14 22:56:29
14717," We're going to be a toy and they'd unbox it, they'd show each component. We just got Uncle Screamy. I would speak to many of those creators. We signed many of those creators at Maker Studios to be our partners. And it was fascinating in that it was this whole new genre and this home new format. And that corresponded with a rise of kids and family viewership on YouTube. That was stark, that was hard to miss. And you would see it in the data. And we had access to a lot of data in Maker Studios around YouTube. Let's see what's inside. First up we have the Storm Super Pig. You saw the launch of EvanTube, who I consider the first child, so to speak, unboxing star. And they would open toys and kids would just mesmerize by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxed in just about every toy. You know, it was, and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out. And kids just got excited, see it piece by piece. Yeah, he's in a bathroom. We're in a, he's eating a lobster. You know, the early days of these unboxing videos, the videos were, you know, from a adult's perspective, just terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was absolutely no production value. And if you think about these executives, you know, they're, they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience. And they're, they're brought these videos and say, well, look at this video. It has 200,000 views on it. And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kind of bizarre. Who would want to watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box? But then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fundamental play pattern there is, it started to make sense. And I think that, I have to say that the company that really jumped on that in the most conserved way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise had three key elements, a doll play, which is, you know, basically the most popular play pattern there is. Collectible. So within each LOL surprise, you get a little sheet that showed you all the other dolls you collect. And then the surprise factor. You don't know which doll you were getting. It was a blind pack, as they call it. And LOL was made by this company called MGA. In fact then, you know, in 2016, they were a small player in the toy industry, founded by this guy named Isaac Larian. He's a CEO and founder. I have three adult kids and they were making fun of me that, oh you're old, you don't know anything about what's happening in today's sink. And I said, like what? And they said, for example, do you know about this iPhone unboxing videos that get millions and millions of views? I thought they're pulling my leg. Children do to make fun of their parents. And then I did go and look one night. And I was frankly shocked and flabbergasted that why would you, why would anybody buy an iPhone, take it home, and open the box and show it on the camera? And everybody can go and watch it. So I typed toy unboxing. And my God, I saw so many different videos and people, kids and adults buying toys like an apple and unboxing it and video and posting it. So that gave me an idea that why not come up with the ultimate. And that's the first LOL surprise. Alright, oh yes, we've got a goal goal. LOL changed the way you open with toys and everybody saw that and the packaging became part of the play, which became part of the entertainment. So normally, if you get a package that you just open a package and take the toy out, that's not exciting. You open up LOL, you peel it away, you open up inside, you have seven surprises. And it took off like wildfire and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top ten toys sold were all LOL.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2943,2022-10-14 23:00:53
14718," Goff, like Wadfire, and quickly became the top toy in the country. By December of 2018, eight of the top 10 toys sold were all LOL Surprise brand. And according to MGA from 2016 to 2020, LOL would generate over $10 billion in retail sales worldwide. You know, LOL is bigger than Star Wars. It's bigger than Marble. It's bigger than Barbie. These brands with huge advertising budgets are known basically by everyone. You don't often, you know, figure out what Marble are or Star Wars is. And LOL eclipse them all. In the toy world, blind bag or blind box toys have been growing in popularity. The most famous example in recent years is Pokemon cards. Where you open packs in hopes of getting a Charizard, but more often wind up with something common like Blagar here. Two years before the launch of LOL in 2014, the Australian toy company Moose Toys launched a blind bag collectible called Shopkins. And in 2016, Spin Master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called Hatchimals. But the thing that sets LOL Surprise apart is that it mainly focused on YouTube. And not putting ads on YouTube, but working with creators and influencers to get their products and the hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA, actually, the move towards YouTube was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom would sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed to pay $3.5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala loop seat dolls. They tried to flex their muscle and they said, well, if you don't agree to our way of seeing things in the conflict that we had, they said that conflict. We are going to stop your advertisement of toys. At the time, Nickelodeon was the number one ranked children's network. And not to be able to advertise in Nickelodeon could have been a death now. But MGA, necessity is the mother of invention, that caused them to lean into digital advertising far more than any big brand had ever done before because they had to. They had to find a new way to reach kids. The court would ultimately rule in favor of Viacom. Both in LA Federal Court and on appeal in the 9th Circuit. Larry and Blaine, the court, defeat on what he contends was judicial bias. Nickelodeon Parent Company Viacom didn't respond to a request for comment. So, dad buys their forces to go and say, okay, they had with Nickelodeon. Let's find another way to reach to children. And that's how we went and doubled up on YouTube, especially. And the rest as they say. So early on, MGA partnered with YouTube creators with huge audiences, like Cookie Swirl-C. Good morning, Chocolatey Chippy Cookies. We are going to be spending the morning with this LOL Surprise Baby Fancy. They took it another step further. They actually helped kids learn how to do their own unboxing videos. They gave them support and learning and tools. And so all these kids got to be kind of a little mini influencer themselves as they were unboxing their LOL products. So just to give you a flavor of how popular these videos are, go onto YouTube and search LOL Surprise. And you'll see videos with a million views, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million, and even 100 million. There's lots of them. And kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2944,2022-10-14 23:05:02
14719," 100 million. There's a lot of them and kids are watching these videos and they're probably watching them over and over again. The old way toy manufacturers would do things is they buy TV which was about 90% of their ads spend and then traditional PR get on the big morning shows. It's an entirely different formula. It's much harder for toy companies right now because the formula is so complicated you have to really take a deep dive into each platform. Am I promoting on Twitter? Am I promoting on Instagram? Am I promoting on TikTok? What am I doing on YouTube? You have to look at every possible social channel. By 2017, big toy brands like Mattel had shifted nearly 50% of their marketing budget to social platform advertising. Brands would help seed videos of their toys. And if they were lucky, that could kick off a wave of creators making their own content around the product. In 2020 alone, tubular labs estimated that LOL related content had amassed 5.1 billion views. This idea of imitation. So when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children, having this experience, the more kids felt what it would be like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. One of the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's necessarily an advertisement versus real content. And that's a big criticism of this industry is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube at young ages, not being supervised by their parents and just watching these videos. And they don't realize that maybe that influencer is getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation. And that, you know, blurs the lines for kids is sort of developing and figuring out how to consume media. Questionable advertising concerns aside, kids YouTube creators would take off. Channels like Ryan's World would grow to almost 30 million subscribers and a whole industry formed around them. When we first started working with influencers, they were very happy to work for free product. You give them the product and they do something for you. Then gradually influencers got smarter and started, you know, charging for their services as they started building a following. Now, because it is such a big business, the dollars can be significant investing in big influencers. When Spin Master launched one of its new TV series and associated product, we made it a point to buy an advertising package with Ryan's World to ensure that we could get really quick, big reach right away. This is an advertisement for Spin Master. So from these unboxing videos, the content's gotten a lot more sophisticated. They're creating narratives around the toys, voices, meta-universes, if you will. And it's really engaging content, even more so than the original unboxing videos for these kids. The content's coming out maybe once a week, or even daily. So if you think about it, what they've done is they've created basically a TV show around a toy. It's not unlike what we saw back in the 80s, which was criticized back then, by the way. When you had toys like GI Joe, turned into an animated series, or Masters of the Universe, or Transformers. So we've kind of seen this full circle now, right? So back to where we were, content, and basically many television shows, creating around toys on YouTube. Kids content on YouTube is likely to face increased regulation in the coming years. In 2019, the company would agree on a $170 million settlement with the FTC for serving ads based on personal data to kids on YouTube. YouTube would put more emphasis behind its Made For Kids platform, YouTube Kids. And each video uploaded to YouTube must be flagged as either Made For Kids or Not. In a statement outlining changes to the site, YouTube would say that, responsibility is our number one priority at YouTube, and this includes protecting kids and their privacy. Still, the site is far less regulated than traditional television. I do think parents have a better understanding of YouTube now, and the New genres and formats there, that they didn't prior. And they now notice things like their...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2945,2022-10-14 23:09:31
14720," of YouTube now and the New Genre is in formats there that they didn't prior and they now notice things like their kid isn't watching a toy unboxing that's a commercial for a toy. Their kid is watching other kids play with toys in an imaginative way which inspires them to go play with things in the real world in an imaginative way. In just a few short years, YouTube had caused a transfer of power from toy and network executives to nine year olds and their families. The Kaji family may have started out as toy reviewers but now Ryan has launched his own line of toys. A cartoon series. He was even a blimp in the 2020 Macy's Thanksgiving parade. You and I might think about Spider-Man or Snoopy but today's kids see that blimp of Ryan and they relate to him. He's the character they want to grow up with. He's the character they want to engage with. And as we go forward, these influencers are becoming more and more like big, giant, global brands and that has profound effects for entertainment going forward. You know, our mission is that everyone can belong anywhere. We're talking, you know, 300 million stays on any average year and there's tyranny and numbers. The vast majority of Airbnb stays don't result in a safety incident but sometimes things go wrong. And for Airbnb, you know, we're talking thousands of safety incidents that occur every year that the company has to handle and has to respond to. I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. We're talking murder, we're talking rape. We're talking, you know, the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb. Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know, that's really bad for their brand, their reputation and their public image, particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur, that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last two years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups, it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of move fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and win the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it. An apink night is past August. We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of the world is in the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2946,2022-10-14 23:13:44
14721," We had one million people from around the world coming from 180 countries in a single night staying in an Airbnb home. The vast majority of Airbnb stays. We're talking, you know, two million people staying in an Airbnb on any given night don't result in a safety incident. But sometimes things go wrong. And for the company, you know, it was dealing with these cases was a really challenging, difficult, complicated area. You had hosts and guests and sometimes they disagreed on what happened. You had regulatory issues in some of their biggest cities. Then you also had, you know, the growth of the platform and the fact that if you're going to try and prevent some of these incidents, it could cut into revenue and cut into the number of listings that you have. So for Airbnb, it was about trying to figure out the best way to handle these crises in a way that's going to not only protect the individual in crisis, but also protect the company's public image, its brand, its reputation, which is essentially what its business is based upon. As Airbnb grew, like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone, they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handled the worst of the worst cases. Over the course of my reporting, I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Airbnb and, you know, seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit. These safety agents, many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds. They're trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and, you know, help people who are going through what may be, you know, the worst day in their lives. For these safety agents, a lot of them understood that they had a dual role. First and foremost, they wanted to protect the user in crisis, but they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand and public image. I mean, everything about housing in New York is a total mess and it's always chaotic. It's not too surprising that Airbnb's biggest battle has broken out here. 2015 was a really challenging year for Airbnb. Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels. You know, the company was seven years old now. It had grown huge. It was now a household name, but by growing that big that fast, they also came up against, you know, a pushback in regulations. Now, Airbnb's under attack in a lot of measures. What are they saying about this? They are, well, they can't give up on New York because New York's too important for every kind of reason. They knew that they couldn't lose the battle in New York because it was one of their biggest markets and also it could result in a domino effect. If other cities around America saw New York City either backing down on regulations or enforcing stricter regulations, that could in turn be rolled out right across the country. I think it's going to be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that the whole thing might be somewhat illegal in our biggest market. And in December of that year, a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner Bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29-year-old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone, but she wasn't. There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her, dragged her into a room and raped her. He later fled. About an hour after this attack, he came back and police were in the apartment at the time. They opened his backpack and found three items of interest, the kitchen knife, one of the woman's earrings, and a set of keys to the Airbnb. This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2947,2022-10-14 23:18:08
14722," This case was a really complicated one for Airbnb partly because it occurred in New York City where they were fighting this really tough battle with city officials over regulations and partly because the alleged rapist had the keys and he was inside the apartment. That meant that Airbnb needed to do what it could to protect itself. They wanted to find out, you know, how did he get the keys? It was a really big question for them. They launched an investigation to find that out. But before they did anything like that, before they thought to kind of protect their own reputation here, they really focused on doing what they could to help this young woman. They paid for her to move to a hotel. They paid for her mother to fly in from Australia. They paid for both of them to fly home. They offered to cover any health or lead or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally, they also launched an investigation. They wanted to know how did the alleged rapist get the keys? How did he get inside that Airbnb? And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner bodega, that then created, you know, a problem of liability for Airbnb. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb, they also, you know, they wanted to know what was going to be said in court. They wanted to know if any media were going to pick up on this story. And they wanted to know what their legal liability potentially could be. A week later, the alleged rapist was indicted in the Supreme Court in New York. An Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was going to be mentioned in any of the court records. And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And, you know, for Airbnb, that was kind of lucky. This case never landed in the media. And, you know, 18 months later, when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company, they signed a settlement for $7 million. And part of that settlement, there's a clause that says she cannot assert or imply responsibility on the part of the company. We've spoken to legal experts who indicate that what this really did is gag the woman from saying, I blame Airbnb. Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid situation where you have users who meet online and then actually meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. With Airbnb's terms of service, that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company, this is all handled behind closed doors in arbitration. Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom. And when they do, the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal precedent that's set to determine what Airbnb's liability is here. And is it really responsible for when things go wrong inside its listings? What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2948,2022-10-14 23:22:26
14723," What I learned over the course of my reporting is that this is anything but simple. This is a complicated, nuanced area. There are difficult trade-offs here. The company also has to have hard, you know, tough conversations about policy. Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheske, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay in each other's homes. What he built was a community that trusts one another. And when that premise is undercut, Airbnb's entire business model is under threat. Sounds far-effectured at the moment, doesn't it? But you know, we may be seeing ads like this in the not-too-distant future. Living away from Earth has always captured our imagination. As well as providing a basics for survival, these ideas are a symbol of human kinds' unique creativity and ambition. This advanced beast or a species diesel would be hit quadrace for the final sense of the moon. Today, the idea of multiple outposts where we can live and work in space has never seen closer. We're going to fly. It's about making our lives the best we can make it. It's about as a species having a path for our future. And the mission to create these habitats is well underway, as private companies get ready to take that next giant leap. The International Space Station, it's the only space habitat we have. One of the first places they take you in the ISS is the Kupala. So you can finally look at the Earth in all its beauty and I don't care who you are, it's always stunning, it's shocking, it's amazing because that's the view you've been waiting for your entire life. It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing and at an estimated cost of $150 billion it's the most expensive object we've ever built. You think about like the cysteine chapel, the pyramids and the Burj Khalifa or take your pick, I mean it far outstrips those. It's the one and only non-terrestrial human outpost. We've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the International Space Station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was pieced together in space over the course of a decade. Since 2000 it's been a permanently crude research laboratory, a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live, manufacture and explore beyond Earth. The overarching achievement of the space station has been education. It has educated us about how to do research, it's educated us about how to live, it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning I think. People say what was one of your favorite parts about being up there, hands down floating everywhere I went, but your first impressions, where ISS certainly is, it's how big it is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2949,2022-10-14 23:26:47
14724," For ISS, certainly it's how big it is. The ISS is a size of an American football field. With most of that footprint taken up by eight solar arrays, these provide enough energy to power 40 homes. The station has an American side and a Russian side, as well as contributions from other nations like Canada, Japan and the European Union. Astronauts on board can pass freely between these sections. Their living and working areas are made up of modules, each 4.2 metres in diameter, and in total they have the same volume as a Boeing 747. The three main labs, destiny, hope and Columbus, are conducting up to 600 ongoing experiments at any one time. And while it's been a collaboration between governments to build and maintain the ISS, its next chapter will rely more on private enterprise. Today is a very remarkable day. NASA is opening the International Space Station to commercial opportunities and marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining the ISS costs $3.4 billion a year. That's over half NASA's Space Operations budget. Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs, which is why NASA is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies. We would like to see a robust commercial marketplace in low-rether orbit where space stations exist outside of NASA, the goal being that NASA could be a customer. And we want to have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation. With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025, opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars. Transparent to a more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that NASA has traditionally been responsible for, like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems. But the most exciting part, I think, is new opportunities. The iPhones would have never come from the government, for instance. The base technology came from the government, but the way it's used, the way it interacts with consumers, governments aren't really built for that. So I think that would be exciting to see how private industry uses the same technology or the same systems within using it in a different way. Every NASA achievement has been the collaborative achievement of NASA and industry. What's going on right now that's a little bit different is NASA is turning to companies not to direct them what to do, but it's turning to companies to build relationships with them because those companies are attracting investment from non-space sources and are bringing a different kind of innovation to the table. In the shadow of NASA's sprawling Johnson Space Center, the headquarters of startup Axiom Space might seem a little modest, but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station. Led by a former ISS program manager, the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception. We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today. So this is key to continuing the heritage of ISS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I liken this to the internet. So the internet was created and we got very excited. And any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming skills could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a microgravity environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet is limitless and it is not immediately obvious to us. All the benefits that that's going to entail, but over time it will become very, very obvious. By 2024, Axiom plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station. This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research and manufacturing modules. When the ISS is retired, this will break away and additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for 150.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2950,2022-10-14 23:31:12
14725," Additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm. And they're hoping to do all of this for one-fiftyth, the cost of the ISS. I mean, when you talk about our vision, it sounds really simple. It really is about driving the thought process and the cost down so that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so. And that's really it. Okay, Ellen, I need to go towards my feet. The International Space Station is a fantastic vehicle. But one of the big things is they have quite a few major components outside, which means you have to do an EVA, a spacewalk to go fix it. A spacewalk on a good day is 100 hours of crew time to get ready and actually go do the spacewalk. So we're able to take advantage of the reduced size of components. And so our design is going to have all of the components are going to be in the pressurized environment. So we know what the basics are, you know, water, food, clothing, life support, and we know how to handle those. And now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive? And we want to now take advantage of the technologies and the capabilities that have today to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. You're every day doing whatever you want to do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window. Whatever you're there to do, we want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment. And it's because of our experience on ISS and what the team brings to the Axiom space, we're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that. Three, two, one. Release, release, release. Fire, fire. Like Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin, Axiom is hoping to attract space tourists with tickets starting at $55 million for a 10-day mission. But that's just one part of the commercial space station market that they think could be worth $37 billion over the next decade. Our first commercial customers are countries who have astronauts in space and want to expand their activity in space. And countries who do not yet have a human spaceflight program who want to send people up. And we've now got both research and manufacturing companies who want to do work with us while we're at the International Space Station and on our platform after it separates from ISS. Human spaceflight is particularly exciting because it's that slice of space that is really nested. It hasn't undergone the crowding that satellites have had. It hasn't already had that explosive growth. It's really ready for that now. The first thing I'm really looking forward to seeing happen is the face of our first astronauts on orbit looking back down on us and knowing that we had a hand in sending that person to space. And ultimately the separation of ISS when it's ready to be retired and de-orbited and then we continue in space independently. For me that is a stepping-off moment for humanity. It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space to building our permanent home in space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Bigelow Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanorax have put forward proposals. Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false dichotomy to say, okay, we're done with the International Space Station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what NASA is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attach to the space station or work collaboratively with the space station. The next chapter cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. That said that active engagement might not be as customers, might not be as drivers, it might be in service of government mission objectives. We will return American astronauts to the moon, not only to leave behind footprints and flags, but to build the foundation we need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach Iran.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2951,2022-10-14 23:35:28
14726," We need to send Americans to Mars and beyond. This proposed mission, along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach your red planet, has opened up a longer-term market. And some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets. I was working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know, I saw Elon and he landed his Falcon X rocket in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger. I thought, wow, this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars. And if he's going at the pace he's going, it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I want to be the one to build it. In this warehouse, alongside startups from across the US, architect your firm AI Space Factory are refining the production of Marsha. A four-story structure they created for a NASA competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. You know, when we started designing our Mars habitat, Marsha, I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from NASA. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call in-situ resource utilization. So use the materials that are there. If you've seen sci-fi movies, you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets. But the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon or Mars would be so exorbitantly expensive you would never be able to build in the first place. So the idea is to send a 3D printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugar cane and basalt. A rock found on Mars and Earth. It's the rock that gives us its incredible strength. We've tested this material. It's three times as strong as concrete in compression. And it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity and prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at. You need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use. And that's also why this thing is shaped like an egg. And if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very very thin but it provides the strength that the egg needs and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. The egg shape as well as a nested shell structure also accommodates for extreme differences in pressure and temperature on the surface of Mars. But more research still needs to be done to find out how print materials could be gathered and how 3D printing would work in a unique environment of space. You're dealing with a completely different set of physics and environments which is very harsh. The cold, you know, the low gravity, the vacuum of space, you know. And finding solutions for how to build their or do anything in space just requires a high degree of innovation. There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space. Like you need to think about the problem, find a very elegant lightweight cost-effective solution. The next challenge is really going to places on Earth, literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt. We have to perfect this technology on Earth and then we go prove it out on the moon and then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions. But before that, AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on Earth. The challenges of building on Mars forced us to kind of make this jump in construction technology which we can now apply on Earth to build more sustainably. So rather than building with steel and concrete which are these manufactured very energy intensive materials to go to a site have a solar-powered array that would then allow our 3D printer to print in the most sustainable way possible. And we never would have found these ways there wasn't for the challenge of building in space. 3, 2, 1, ignition and lift off of the Falcon 9 to the space station. On the first commercial launch from Kennedy Space Centers, historic had 39A.

14727," Case centers historic have 39 A. Humans have now been consistently living and working in space for more than 15 years. And if we want to keep that up, what do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small. But the future of space habitats really, to me, comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we want to be in the future. We have to learn how to benefit from what we do on orbit and bring those natural benefits back home so we help ourselves out on the ground while we also learn to live somewhere else. And it really, at the very deepest level, is about survival or species. So I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do because this really is the first step to learning to live off the planet. That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping in to imagine what these new space habitats look like, it's what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialisation. On the next episode of Giant Leap, we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space. Using the unique properties of microgravity, they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on Earth, including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to 3D print full human organs. But before low Earth orbit can become a new industrial centre, we're going to need to take another giant leap. This is how it used to work. A real estate agent would lock in the client, they'd stage the place, hold an open house every single weekend, and hope that the right buyer walks through that door. Ten years ago, you could probably go look at a house and circle back two to three weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid. The first time I received a lead through Instagram, my mind was blown. If you're seeing something in a neighbourhood that is established, you have two to three days after the open house in this market to make an offer. Our world has shifted so much, folks are getting comfortable doing business either through social media or 100% virtual. Social media, like everything else it touches, has turned the real estate business upside down. You've heard this trope before, millennials aren't buying and owning as much as their parents' generation, be it a car, a diamond, or a home. But the lack of ownership is not always by choice. In 2018, a survey found that 89% of millennial Americans want to buy a home. They just can't afford it. As of 2019, millennials of all stripes owned only 5% of US housing, compared with 15% for gen Xers. Millennials haven't been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now, this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2953,2022-10-14 23:44:08
14728," been able to make these big ticket purchases the same way as their predecessors did. Now this is down to the financial crisis. We have rising student loan debt and a higher cost of living. Now millennials are getting older. They're earning more money and saving more. So now is about the time where a lot of them are going out and making those purchases. And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Uber's and Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and I have a child. So, you know, looking for more space and thought about a conventional route of young and single living in the city and then move out to the suburbs, we have a kid in a wife. I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach, my AMI area, Austin, Texas. So they are certainly moving out of the city, but space was top of mind for them moving out. We lived in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic. We just realized we needed more. So we started looking for a house right away. We now live in Gosha, New York, which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like Circa Houses and Cheap Old Houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life. Often at a price point, not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities. By the end of 2020, New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2,700 a month for an apartment, even as rent prices plummeted during the pandemic. Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now, and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being courted by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online. They're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there. And that's buying things, selling things, Craigslist, eBay, all that. Making a $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1,000 purchase on eBay, it's not that much of a leap to go even further. If you're buying a fancy piece of jewelry or a house for a million bucks. The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic, combined with record low interest rates, has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year. So much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house, site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and, you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. The houses weren't really being shown at that time because we were in full lockdown. We became really interested in one YouTube video, 20 Z-LO photos, and that is it. The Red Hot Housing Market spells opportunities for developers targeting this demographic, getting eyeballs strictly through social media. People are not looking in the back section of the times anymore for real estate listings. Our demographic is between late 20s to mid 40s, and that demographic is spending a lot of time on social media, and they're doing a lot of shopping via Instagram and other social media platforms. This is Joshua Gelb and Pele Hamburger. During the pandemic, the two New York City-based developers started Neville House, a new construction project two hours north of the city. Unlike most traditional real estate listings, the pair bypassed the use of a broker and advertised their homes directly on Instagram. No fees, no commissions. You used to have to hire a broker, work with them, they would do showings on site. Now you basically put your renderings on Instagram, and within an hour you have 15, 20 replies saying, can I come see it directly with you and let's see it tomorrow, and it's just completely changed the game. Most people have that image in their head of the quid-essential upstate modern cabin set in the woods. We've definitely tried to tap into that and create something that's attainable for these people. Say, you can have that. You can be swiping through Instagram and that can be your home too. There's been quite a proliferation of these direct to consumer brands. There's just tons of them out there. It's not that hard to start up a website that sells things and get things manufactured for that e-commerce platform. So like all birds with shoes, Casper with mattresses, or Warby Parker with glasses. All of that means a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2954,2022-10-14 23:48:40
14729," a lot more opportunity for brands in the online shopping space. So it's natural that real estate would want to get involved as well with these big ticket items. 10 years ago, the broker would drive the search. Now I think that my clients text me listings, they have alerts, they find things quicker than we do sometimes because we're out and about. I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Social selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So let's look at vintage clothing, for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the ephemeral nature of social media, you post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Now real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification. Researcher Andre Perry, who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute, says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Social media is a primary source to get news and information, but it's not just about social media, it's about the movement that we're in. The racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment. And so people not only are getting information about what protects people in the long run from economic shocks, things like wealth. In his research, Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic, the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through home ownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection, I want to live longer, I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth and the fastest way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops, and so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money and bought property and outside of the city generally. People are moving to the suburbs, to rural areas, places where home prices are a little bit cheaper. Many home buyers are looking for houses outside the major metropolitan areas. Additionally, many home buyers are looking for direct outdoor access and added space as the uncertainty about the virus persist. Millennials are also looking to influencers not just for the latest trends and TikTok dances, but to partake in important conversations, be it about politics or personal finance or anything in between. I meet folks like Brandon Rool and Charlotte Main the God. You have residential real estate and you have commercial real estate. They're talking about buying homes. When I was coming out, really home buying was a mysterious, shrouded process that only a few people could teach me. Now I can easily log on to Clubhouse or Instagram and find literally lessons on how to purchase a home, but done with savvy and finesse. Today we're going to make a greenhouse. I am DIY-ing the entire closet. Heather, having bought her fixer-upper site on scene, also looked to internet personalities to help figure out how to modernize and to make sure her home was also an investment. It gave us a lot of confidence. They make it look super easy. How we could do all of those things ourselves. My husband just installed a laundry shoe, which is something we never would have thought of if we didn't see an influencer do that and how easy it actually is. Really simple to do it yourself project. You can do that. You have any questions. Go ahead and message me. And in the case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. We're going to need young families. Look at these products. They're looking at our homes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2955,2022-10-14 23:52:45
14730," In case of Neville House, Josh and Paley hope that buyers see these homes as potential secondary income. These young families look at these products, they look at our homes and say, here's a turnkey, this can serve our family, but this can also be the perfect rental. We've tried to strike a balance in the design of the home for working well as a family home. That's going to be lived in and also working as an investment. A lot of this just points to how millennials can utilize and leverage social media to their benefit, but it also speaks to, again, this moment that folks want freedom. So, millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and taking ownership and building well. Of course, not everything is as it seems online. While social media can be a useful tool for learning, there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter. We knew going into it, budgeting for a lot of renovations, we kind of thought if we buy it at 450, we could put to 300,000 into the house and really make it ours and our own. We can't wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer, which was not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely unrealistic. We have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram, they say, I love it, can you come build this on my property? And then they'll send us the lot, which they bought site on scene during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning, it's virtually unbuildable. I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life are two very different things. So, while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives, the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework, don't believe everything you say. That's not to say that there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you, but not everything you see is accurate. This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Many of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or loans often precluded black people because they deemed us too risky for those loans. With technology, there's ways to get around that. As long as more black people get educated on racism and discrimination and lending, we're going to figure out ways to get around that racism. When I was 24 years old, I saw the UFC on a paper view on TV and I was so overwhelmed by the athleticism, the skill and then at the end of the fight, the combatants hugged, they shook hands and I just fell in love with it. Part of UFC's appeal is it doesn't look like a balletic display of martial talent and mastery as much as it looks like a bar fight.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2956,2022-10-14 23:57:05
