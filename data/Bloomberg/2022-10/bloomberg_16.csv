And if you do not treat it like a business, I guarantee you that the promoter is. And you will be left broken, broken at the end of your career. Each of us have an individual story, but as with anything you take enough of these individual stories and you see not only crossover but intersectionality. A group of former UFC fighters that are suing the UFC scored a key legal victory on Thursday when a federal judge said he would grant their lawsuit class action status. There have been fights in every major US sport about workers' power in the labor market. I don't think there's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Fights over unionization in some sports, fights over free agency in baseball, and in boxing the Muhammad Ali Act, which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports, of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work and who they do it for. Mixed martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states. John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC, but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get seriously injured at times. My nose has been broken multiple times. I had my right pectoral torn off, how to get that reattached. I've had my jaw broken to two places, I've had my neck broken. I had my left ankle broken, how to get that repaired. I've had a torn right laborer in my shoulder. He broke my eyeball, I mean the bone that holds up my eyeball. I've had my left eye, orbital fracture, twice where my eye caved in, I was walling my own blood. I knew, don't blow your nose or both eyes of the world. At the time that UFC was bought for just $2 million by the former boxing coach, Dana White, and a casino owner. He'd been friends with Lorenzo Fertita and his brother Frank Fertita. UFC was struggling as were other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer-upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for $2 million was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They've hold off a multi-pronged strategy that was quite successful. First, they did what White has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time, they also popularized it. They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. It is all over. The Able Sanchez is The Ultimate Fighter. UFC, Under Dana White, had a gift for weaving, compelling personal narratives and rivalry. People throwing shoes, a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash. My first contract with the UFC is kind of an interesting story because here I am on this reality show The Ultimate Fighter. And they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC. It's at us all down individually.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2957,2022-10-15 00:01:23
14732," Reality show the ultimate fighter and they started to realize how big of a stepping stone this was going to be for the UFC Sad us all down individually put a contract in front of us and said hey, we realized that This is gonna be huge and we really want to have you all a part of that UFC family moving forward So we want to go ahead and get this out of the way just sign this simple contract and we'll be able to move forward as one unit But as I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do. Dana White looks at me and says Don't worry. This thing takes off. We'll take care of you The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing And the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. They're long-term. They last multiple fights Fighters under these contracts are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time and UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured They control who the fighter fights they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a Pre-Asian contracts are so one-sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as Their stranglehold on the sport of MMA got so much stronger part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC Successfully took other competitors off the board The UFC had such a stranglehold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down They really became the the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally If you follow Dana White's Twitter or watch him on YouTube You could have seen Dana White calling himself the grim reaper and bragging about how he has defeated or derailed or acquired one after another Company that tried to compete with the UFC in 2011 UFC acquired strike force which at the time was the most prominent rival still standing Come leave it's unbelievable. It was a great buy this year for one more time Scott Smith and come leave The CEO of strike force Scott Coker has said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker Up against the death star trying to compete with UFC eventually when strike force was bought out by UFC My only option was go to UFC because they had the rest of my contract now. I'm under A contract where it's only an 18 month contract with six fights but five years later. I'm still stuck in the contract The month before UFC's parent company Zoofa completed its act acquisition of strike force a UFC executive Sent an email and the subject line of that email was we own MMA And the UFC has admitted in documents That have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2958,2022-10-15 00:05:40
14733," And the UFC has admitted in documents that have now become public that they've almost never lost a fighter that they wanted to keep. In internal UFC emails, we now know the company referred to what it was doing as choking off oxygen to the competition. The most important oxygen that UFC allegedly ran a foul of the law by cutting off to its competitors is the fighters themselves. And not only did they make it clear to us, they made it clear to the whole mixed martial arts world, there is no negotiating. These are our very strict, never-ending contracts and that's the case of this day. The UFC just says, oh, you want to fight for us, you sign here. If you don't want to, we've got 20 other guys that will take your spot. They have 70, 80, 90% of the top fighters under exclusive contract, meaning that those fighters are not available to any other MMA promoter. And fighters, even if they wiggled their way out of the very restrictive contract that UFC imposed on them, didn't have another professional mixed martial arts option because there weren't robust rivals to go sell their work to. On Tuesday afternoon, a class action lawsuit was filed in US District Court in San Jose against Zufa, LLC, with fighters, Kung-Li, Nate Corey, and John Fitch attached to the suit. Rampe Jassin came to me and said, hey, Kung, I know this lawyer, he will help get the fairness for the fighters in the marketplace. And I decided I wanted to step up for all the fighters that he affected. At the end of 2014, more than six years ago now, a group of now-all former fighters filed anti-trust class action lawsuit against UFC. And in broad terms, the case is an antitrust case where we're claiming that the UFC is both a monopoly and a monopsony. Usually, when we talk about monopoly, we're talking about the power that a company has when it becomes the only one selling something. Money is about the power of being a monopoly purchaser of something, and particularly a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds in its revenue sores, how much should we expect that absent illegal conduct, the fighters pay would soar as well. When UFC, year after year, the share of the company's revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting, has hovered around or below 20%. And what this analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC was competitive and did not allegedly violate the antitrust laws, it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenues is generated just like baseball, just like hockey, just like basketball, boxing. If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated, it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated, the fighters would have made $1.6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. Sometimes when you write about allegations against companies and particularly about lawsuits against companies, those companies don't want to say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me has been pretty feisty about this, saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks and succeed, and that they don't want to roll over, that they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to described having side jobs, being reliant on UFC in part because after taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. They'll review my career from the financial.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2959,2022-10-15 00:10:04
14734," After taxes and expenses, they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure. The overview of my career from a financial perspective is something that had a challenge in admitting. I can tell you now that I lived in my mom's attached caravans the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job as a bouncer and a bartender, a third job as a personal trainer just to make ends meet. Nate Quarry told me that over his time in UFC, he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight. It gets so disheartening because I've seen fights that are called the fight of the year. This is just this brutal war and they battled for four and a half rounds until one guy's body just gave up. And then you find out, oh, that guy made $60,000 for that fight. In one of the hearings in this lawsuit, UFC's attorney argued that if the fighters were really the product, if all that UFC were selling were the fighters, then the fighters wouldn't need UFC at all. That a fighter is not themselves the UFC product any more than an Apple engineer who makes a cool iPhone is the product that Apple is selling. We the fighters make this whole thing happen and it's been driven by Chuck LaDelle. It's been driven by Reyna Gattour. It's been driven by Conor McGregor. It's been driven by Brock Lesnar. It's been driven by all the greats that have walked before us and that walk this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly. It's the identity and rank and popularity of those fighters that attract the eyeballs and make the sport what it is. And if you can lock all those up and keep them from other promotions, you can dominate the sport, which is what they've admitted they've done. William Isaacson, a lawyer for UFC, said in a statement that UFC has spent many years building a world class organization enhancing the brand of our athletes and championing the sport of MMA. UFC pays its fighters more than any other MMA promoter with average fighter compensation rising by over 600% since 2005. Our efforts have raised the global popularity of the sport and the overall revenue potential of all MMA organizations and athletes. In December of 2020, the judge announced a crucial step in this lawsuit, which is that he is going to certify it as a class action. Class certification makes this lawsuit a much more significant threat to UFC and the judge made clear long before saying how he planned to rule that he expected whatever he did to be appealed into federal appeals court and on from there to the US Supreme Court. So we are likely in for many more months and years of wrangling over this. Kyle Kingsbury said that he doesn't think any settlement would be acceptable unless it includes a change to the restrictive contracts that UFC uses to keep fighters bound to the UFC. My son is about to turn six years old and it started when he was in the womb. We are in this thing to the end to change the sport forever. We want the same freedoms that are offered in any other major sport. Every other major sport has gone through what we are going through right now. People tell fighters, just shut up. Look at how lucky you are. Well, no, actually we're fighting for what we believe in. We're going to continue being fighters and that's how we how we're made.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2960,2022-10-15 00:14:28
14735," Ahhh... Every nation that's a coastal state has some region of the sea floor that falls within their territorial waters and many countries including the U.S., the area that's underwater exceeds the area that's above water. So huge amounts of nations, areas and regions are just really unexplored, uncharacterized. We don't really know what's there. We know less about our sea bed than we do about the surface of the Moon or Mars. Only 20% of it has been mapped. A map of the sea floor could lead to all kinds of discoveries like numerous species and rare earth minerals like cobalt that we need for electric cars and mobile phones. The value of all the gold deposits are loan on the sea floor is estimated to be around $150 trillion. A map could also help us when tragedy strikes. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared from radar screens. The mapping of the ocean floor has been carried out. The problem is that the southern Indian Ocean is just so incredibly huge. To me, a map is a fundamental piece of understanding of who we are, where we are, where things are. Once you understand something, you start to value it more. When you start to value something, that's when you start to really think about making it healthy and preserving it and keeping it going. A map is the first step. It's the basic understanding that you need to figure out where you are. Oceans. They cover over 70% of the planet, but most of what lies underneath is a mystery. The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail, but in places where we do, there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons, there are sea mounts, mid ocean ridges, all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us by the water. As it stands, this is what a map of the sea bed looks like. All that black? Those are the parts we haven't mapped yet. At present, most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor, but most of that is based on prediction. Roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation based on gravity. In 2017, the Nippon Foundation and the General Barthometric Chart of the Oceans, or Jebco, launched SeaBed 2030. It's a collaborative project to collect and collate data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade. To do this would take one ship around 350 years at a cost of up to $3 billion. That's why data is harvested by all kinds of vessels from fishing boats to freighters. Because there is so little data, it's important that vessels that are capable and willing to acquire data when they're just moving around the ocean do so. So we have a lot of data that's collected during transit. There's a lot of academic requirements to make data publicly available. There's industry data that's starting to become more and more available. There's government data. So there's a lot of different ways that this data is coming in. It's a really messy and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. The seaBed 2030 launched the air.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2961,2022-10-15 00:18:51
14736," see and challenging puzzle to put together. But what's exciting is that it's a puzzle to put together. LAUGHTER Since Seba 2030 launched, the area map has risen to 20%, and all the information collected is freely available. The more data we have collectively and other people can access, the faster the discoveries are made, which really pushes forward our understanding at a faster rate than if you held on to that data. And it was only you with that data. Things like machine learning and artificial intelligence are also going to kick in in the next decade. Because with all this data, they'll be able to make connections that are a lot faster than perhaps we would have been able to, which then, again, feeds our human understanding and also gives us new ideas, new ways of thinking, of exploration. Until the early 20th century, mapping technology was simple. Usually a weight attached to a long rope known as a lead line. After the Titanic sank in 1912, explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the North Atlantic. This led to Sonar, the most common technique used for mapping today. Operated by the Schmidt Ocean Institute, the Falcourt is an 82-meter-long research vessel, equipped with two multi-beam sonar systems that have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to map over a million square kilometers at the sea floor. You know, you go from somebody with a rope, with some knots to sonar acoustics, that is, I call it, math magic, but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multi-beam mapping works by using sonars. So sonar is taking sound and measurement of time. So you have a multi-beam sonar and it sends out a ping of sound. That sound travels through the water column, hits the sea floor, and comes back to the ship, and we measure that time, and we're able to calculate the distance. Each individual ping of sound has many, many beams. So it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor, and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So you have many tiny little beams going across, and they're traveling along a track. You can look at that data, and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows, and create a three-dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multi-beam sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam, and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight, the closer they hold that flashlight to the sea floor, the smaller your beam is, which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So it really depends on the depth of the sea floor, in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 meters in shallow waters to 800 by 800 meters in the deepest parts of the ocean, which go down as far as 11,000 meters. Remotely-operated vehicles or ROVs can then be sent down to investigate seabed features up close. We've just crossed the 1000 metre mark. It's 4.6 degrees C, and now we're going to drive the ROV down at a high rate towards the sea floor. On a recent mapping expedition, scientists on the Falcon were discovered a 500-meter tall coral structure in Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the first to be discovered in over 120 years. A place that is incredibly popular, well-visited, well-traveled, we're still finding new things. You don't know until you map it, and so until you get that high resolution picture, you don't know the sand waves or the old riverbeds that used to be there, or the waterfalls off the side of a volcano that used to be above the surface and now is below the surface. It's a little bit of everything. Think of let's say Hawaii, or someplace where you see a volcano above the water, picture that below the water. I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2962,2022-10-15 00:23:19
14737," I'm really kind of obsessed with the whole concept of scale here. Although we can create 3D models and, you know, kind of come up with these visualizations, it's not the same as that feeling of looking out over this big landscape. But I mean, I think we'll get there soon with VR and other kinds of technology, but it's really spectacular to think about, especially with the familiarity that some of us have with these features, like what it looks like. We look out at the ocean and it just looks flat, maybe with little bumps. We really don't think about all of this that's underneath, and it's really an amazing landscape that's just hidden from us. With more than 90% of the ocean deeper than 200 meters, fleets of autonomous vehicles could make the data gathering process faster, cheaper and safer. And new discoveries might help with exploration of all kinds. I think the ocean can actually provide us with huge inciters, we go out into space as well and look for life and other kinds of life forms. I also think in this next few years, we will have a different kind of access to the ocean because of virtual reality and augmented reality. And so that will allow us to sit in our living rooms and really experience what's underwater in a different way and see this different alien planet. Since the dawn of man, meat has been on the menu. And even with growing trends of vegetarian diets and plant-based substitutes, around 89% of the world population consider themselves omnivores. We've come a long way from our hunter and gatherer roads. We have managed to establish a whole industry designed to feed almost 7.7 billion people. We've maximized production and we managed to reduce hunger over the past couple of decades. And although we've become exceedingly efficient at putting meat on the table, raising livestock animals by the billions comes with its own set of consequences. If animal agriculture continues to expand the way it has, there is a race that we won't be able to stop climate change. But with rapid advances in technology, we might soon see a food industry that leaves all those problems behind. I'm about to be one of the world's first commercial customers for lab-grown meat, culture of meat. It's eat-just as the company and I'm very, very excited. Here is the chicken. It's pretty crispy outside. It's really good. I mean, look, it's really tasty. Here at 1880 in Singapore, culture chicken is being served under a regulatory approval granted by the Singaporean government. It's the very first time a cultured meat product meat made from animal cells grown in a lab has been approved for commercial sale. It's eat-just, the company behind the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2963,2022-10-15 00:27:23
14738," The very first time a cultured meat product, meat made from animal cells grown in a lab, has been approved for commercial sale. Eat just, the company behind these chicken nugget-style dishes, is based out of San Francisco, and got their start in 2011, developing plant-based egg substitutes, like mung bean scrambled eggs and mayonnaise. But it wasn't until 2017 that they announced they were shifting focus to a cultured meat product. In order to see the world that we live in, a lot of animal protein, we need to take a third today, and it'll be more tomorrow, of our world, and make it dedicated to feeding chickens and cats. We go to areas that are filled with biodiversity rainforests, taking a bulldozer to them, and planning soy and corn, to feed the chickens that we climate change is accelerated by the kind of animal production that we engage in. When we bring animals in tiny little spaces, it accelerates the probability that more zoonotic diseases are going to impact our families. And from a morality perspective, why do we need to cause any harm to any other living thing, to have dinner that tastes good? It does not have to be that way. And those things underlie the force of this idea. The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant-based. Immutation, beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods. That's a very different proposition from cultured meat, which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company, of any person, trying to make a product that's improving the food system, including all the plant-based proteins. Maybe in some future menu, you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken, and you'll also have a plant-based version. That's fine. But I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime, is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too? We do think we need a more permanent solution. We do think we need, if you will, an end game to this problem. And we just think this is more likely to be the path to achieve that. So animal cell technology has been around for several decades for applications such as development of vaccines and other biotherapeutics. The first known prototype of cultured meat was done by Mark Posts earlier in 2011. And essentially, he was developing beef baddie. It was a very expensive prototype. If I'm not mistaken, above 250,000 euros at the time to produce just one beef baddie, it was more of a group of concepts to really demonstrate that this technology is possible and that it can be done. The way that we grow and produce cultured chicken is essentially a weak isolate chicken cells from the chickens without having to kill them. So from a small biopsy, for instance, we immerse these cells in a liquid broth that contains the nutrients that the cells need to survive and be healthy and to grow. We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product. We're looking into the cells that are really important for meat. So we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by that isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank, what we call the bioreactor, which is essentially providing the same conditions as the animal body. Warm temperatures, some sort of mechanical stimulation so that the cells that are exposed to very similar conditions that they have inside of the animal. After the cells proliferate and reach a certain density, the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid broth that they are in. We just make sure that the product meets our quality and safety standards, and then those cells are ready for consumption. Milk, cheese, yogurt. A lot of those derive from fermentations. The only difference is that they are starting from a different cell type. In this case, we're just using the animal cells as the initial and beginning of the product. Eat just is developed chicken nugget so far with foam.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2964,2022-10-15 00:31:57
14739," initial and beginning of the product. Each just has developed chicken nuggets so far with far more textured chicken breast plan for the future. But another cell-based meat startup meant this meat has already started working on culturing other animal cells as well. We've done beef, we've done duck, we've done chicken, and these are things that are favourites in various parts of the world. For instance, people in America love beef and chicken. People in China love duck, so we wanted to show that we at Memphis meats can produce meats that we as a global population love to eat. There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish. But they're also different because of nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product they need. And I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we give cows and pigs and chickens, but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDA for the last three years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the United States, people will be able to go to the supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right. Once approved, the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle. Before we can only make chicken for myself, my friends, my friends, my family, my colleagues, now we actually have the ability to make chicken for millions of people. So that allows us to invest in to allow the economies to scale to drop the price. The second is we need to reduce the cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming. So they think chicken feed raises or drops a price of chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to increase that and hammering on those things. Of the course, in the next five, 10, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein. And that will be one of the main inflection points that we'll lead to a new way of eating meat. So here is a close-up of a half-eaten crispy chicken bite. You know what? What I'm really thinking is, I'm just eating chicken. I like chicken. No, the normal chickens eat, I don't know where they came from. And so I don't know why I should be very stressed where this came from either. The meat market is worth more than $1 trillion annually and there are over 60 startups in the cultured meat field. Cultured meat has attracted several prominent investors, including Sergi Brin, Richard Branson and Bill Gates. What is also interesting is that even meat giants such as Cargill and Tyson have invested in space. It's this destructive potential of the market as well as the promise to greatly reduce the climate impact of meat production that has attracting investors. It remains to be seen who will get regulatory approval in which countries and whether consumers will like lab-grown meat enough to make the switch. And while there's no evidence that lab-grown meat is any less healthy than traditional meat, there's an ongoing debate over how healthy eating meat is in general. But if these products are a success, they could be the beginning of a more humane, less destructive meat industry. The food and ag industry is the most innovative industry in the world. It's always figured out how to feed a growing population and we've never failed doing so. And it's been very clear to us that we are part of that and we're going to figure out how to feed the next three billion people joining us. And I just see an evolution. We can do this a bit differently. We can do this in a way that is consistent with the kind of people that we want to be, the kind of planet that we all want to live in. We can build a food system that reflects really the best characteristics of who we are. And that makes me really helpful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2965,2022-10-15 00:36:13
14740," You In possible foods might be the world's most ambitious company. People listen to founder and CEO Pat Brown. People wonder how big the plant-based meat industry is going to be. It will be the meat industry in 20 years. We're going to look back and basically say, well, remember back in the day when we used to use animals to make meat? Yes, impossible-stated gold really is to replace the use of animals as a food production technology globally by 2035. That would mean supplanting a $1.2 trillion industry not to mention a source of sustenance as old as time. To be fair, the company has got a lot of people talking about its products. So there's this thing called the Impossible Burger. What's called Artificial Meat, the realest fake-est burger in the world. Not bad. But before impossible foods can take over the world, it's going to have to overcome strong competitors, penetrate tough new markets, and generally transform its product from a conversation piece into a ubiquitous staple food. With the coronavirus turning the world of food upside down, this could be the moment when impossible's new fangled meat goes mainstream. Impossible foods was founded in 2011 when Pat Brown, a longtime vegan, was nearing the end of an accomplished career in biochemistry. I've been astanked as my whole life and just came to this realization that by far the most important scientific question in the world is, what makes meat delicious? Pat Brown, someone call a zealot for his mission. He really doesn't hold back when it comes to talking about wanting to completely replace animal agriculture. Producing meat from animals is the most destructive technology on Earth. And if we're going to avert catastrophic climate change, we have to find a better way to produce meat. You've probably heard about the dangers of cow flatchlets. Their digestive systems produce large quantities of the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. In fact, it's estimated that livestock farming is responsible for nearly 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions. In possible claims, it takes 89% less GHGs, 87% less water, and 96% less land to produce its burger. The key, of course, would be to get people to actually eat the thing, which is where the company's secret ingredient comes in. Him, a genetically engineered substance with a bloody iron-rich taste like red meat. So, him is a very controversial part of the Impossible Burger. It's also what makes the Impossible Burger what it is. There are a lot of consumer groups and anti-GMO groups that oppose the Impossible Burger because of the him. The studies on its safety are a pretty short term, but the FDA has approved it, and the company says it's completely safe. And there isn't any evidence that it isn't. Critics have also challenged the company's claim to health advantages over traditional meat, pointing out that while the Impossible Burger has less fat, sodium and calories than its beefy cousin, it's also more highly processed. But let's be real. We're talking about minicking hamburgers here, not kale salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment, so that's a plus, but they are not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2966,2022-10-15 00:40:23
14741," salads. These burgers are definitely better for the environment so that's a plus but they're not necessarily better for your health. After years in the lab, Patan's colleagues were confident they had a product even Ron Sponson could love and the impossible burger made its debut in 2016. Their burger began its life in the public when it was sold at David Chainspon with Fuku and they went from sort of higher-end find-dining restaurants into higher-end burger restaurants like Bareburger and Mommy Burger and then suddenly they started popping up everywhere. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like meat. This is all made from plants. All made from plants. This tastes like meat. Doesn't that just look like real meat? So meat-like. They always say it's what they're saying. It tastes like a burger. It tastes like yuckers. The foam is the world's relics. Yeah, it doesn't taste like a burger. Opinions differed on the impossible burger's relative meatiness but the debate itself was fantastic free advertising helping to propel impossible into major chains like white castle and then in the summer of 2019 into more than 7,000 burger kings across the US. To date, the company has raised over a billion dollars and a funding round in March valued the company at around four billion. But fake meat is a happening space these days and impossible faces some daunting competition. So I'm now for the stock of the hour and that is Beyond Meat shares of the faux meat or plant-based protein company are soaring today. Beyond meat is also making a very meaty burger from plants. They're very non-GMO. They stress that all the time to differentiate themselves from impossible. It'll be much easier to genetically modify plant material to make it take on the texture and appearance and aroma of animal protein. But we won't do that. Beyond Meat had one of the biggest IPOs of the year in 2019. So impossible, which is still privately held, has some catching up to do. But you won't hear Pat Brown knocking his biggest competitor. I wish them nothing but success. They have the same mission we have. The only rival we care about is the incumbent animal-based industry. Rivals or not, impossible and beyond certainly agree on one thing. The true prize isn't the American market. It's China. 27% of the world's meat is consumed in China compared to just 9% in the US. The Chinese population eats a ton of meat. They're a huge market. China's a really interesting case because they have long had vegetarian cuisine as part of their culinary culture. And whether they are looking for meat replacements is still an open question. What we found in our reporting is that some consumers are excited about them. It's just, we don't know if it's going to be enough. To improve its prospects, impossible is developing a plant-based replacement for pork. Globally, pork is the most widely consumed meat. It's almost 40% of all the meat consumed globally. Number one in Europe, number one in China. So if we're going to achieve our mission, pork is, you know, right up there. No word yet on when impossible pork will be available. This morning, growing concerns about the nation's food supply. From butchers to national supermarkets, supplies now limited and prices rising. The impact of the coronavirus on the price and availability of meat has given a boost to companies like Impossible Foods. Over the four weeks ending April 19th, sales of plant-based meat increased. But Impossible has acknowledged some negative effects from the pandemic as well. This being a product that has primarily been served in restaurants, they took a pretty big hit with all the food service shutdowns, although the company doesn't want to say, you know, how much of a hit. They have, however, announced some new retail rollouts. Recently, they announced that they're going to be rolling out with crogrer supermarkets. And that's big. That's great for them. The question of whether this is like getting longed.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2967,2022-10-15 00:44:53
14742," Only they announce that they're going to be rolling out with crogrger supermarkets. And that's big, that's great for them. The question of whether this is like a long-term sea change for these companies. I don't know, just that do I see. It's safe to say impossible stands a slim chance of achieving its goal of replacing the entire meat industry. But it's early days for the science of plant-based meat and it's not impossible that these products could one day contribute to a greener, more humane future. In the meantime, as the technology improves, we get to look forward to many more years of this. This is meat. No, this isn't possible. Yeah, that's what I thought. This is the meat burger. I like it better. It's not even close to a veggie burger or a tofu burger or anything. Wow, that's very, very much. What are is a strategically important point on the map of Pakistan? It sits very close to Iran, actually, on the very southern coast. It's about a 10-hour drive west of Karachi, but it's only about an hour drive to Iran. The area is extremely poor. It's very arid. It doesn't have enough water. Electricity has been very spotty. One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere. You go because it is contested region, because there have been militant attacks in the past. Despite all this, Guadar is a key part of the China-Pakistan economic corridor, also known as CPEC, the crown jewel of President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative. We will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that CPEC and all the projects under its umbrella are materialized in time and in full. So far, just one-third of all CPEC projects have been completed. In Guadar, none of them have been, and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast? We have seen this movie before. An outside power comes into Pakistan. It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China is not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940s, early 50s, the US was sending advisors into Pakistan to help plant economy. The US was doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects helped the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about $80 billion in aid to Pakistan since its independence, but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000s, as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan. The number one item on that aid package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects. So there are literally projects that the United States tried to do or Pakistan proposed to the United States in the 2000s during that period that have become Belt and Road projects. China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2968,2022-10-15 00:49:01
14743," Retreating ambition from the US. The Belt and Road Initiative is China's President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative. Launched in 2013, it comprises an overland belt stretching through China's central Asia into Europe and a maritime road stretching around Southeast Asia through the India Ocean and up past East Africa. So a benign way of characterising China's Belt and Road Initiative would be infrastructure for influence. So when Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative, shortly afterwards China designated Pakistan as its showcase flagship project. So the China Pakistan Economic Quarter was going to be the biggest and most important showcase for the success of the Belt and Road. Pakistan is in great need of infrastructure development. They wanted to create a railway, highway, roads, all kinds of economic development that is intended to help Pakistan. And it's meant to provide jobs, 2.3 million jobs for Pakistanis. It's meant to provide a 2.5% boost to GDP growth. And China would gain economically as well. CPEC was intended to reduce oil and gas routes from the Middle East by thousands of miles, a way to cut overland into Western China instead of going around Southeast Asia by ship. Projects in Pakistan also provide Chinese state owned companies with an additional market. Chinese workers have brought to Pakistan to build infrastructure and then take wages home. CPEC is also strategically significant for China and Pakistan. China wants to strengthen this relationship to counter their shared rival India. CPEC is both an instrument of Chinese power as well as a test of Chinese power. If it succeeds, China will be demonstrating that it's able to do what great powers have not been able to do in Pakistan, including the United States. Which is why Guadal is so important. It's in Pakistan's Balochistan province, an area with serious electricity and water shortages. Balochistan province is actually populated by people who are of Baloch origin. There are different ethnicity. They speak a different language from the majority in power in Islamabad. And they feel as the poorest province in Pakistan, they have not sufficiently benefited from some of the economic achievements that the rest of Pakistan has had. That area is quite contested by the Balochistan Liberation Army. The people who feel that even Pakistani people have encroached into their territory. So quite a number of people are still staging attacks and they attacked the biggest international hotel in Guadar. Shout up the lobby and killed I think five people. But this unsettled city is where the China Pakistan economic corridor is supposed to lead to. Authorities plan to develop Guadar into an international port city. Guadar port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Balochistan. It's about 120 kilometers from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman, I think, in the 1950s. And so for a long time, Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to develop this area. Since the 70s, it's wanted to build a port in Guadar. Actually approached the United States in the 1970s and tried to convince the Nixon administration to pay for a port even offered naval access if the United States was willing to pay for that. The US rejected Pakistan's offer, concerned that the port would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension. But in the early 2000s, a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006. The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2969,2022-10-15 00:53:26
14744," then managed by a Singaporean government entity. In 2013, a Chinese port operator took over from the Singaporeans. In 2015, China announced that it will expand the port as part of the CPEC initiative, but five years later, little has happened. When you look out at the port, you can see it has only three births, and all of them were empty. And the only ship that was in the port at the time was a Pakistan naval frigate. And so it indicated to me that the port is not particularly operational for commercial purposes, and a number of analysts have talked about the strategic importance in a military sense if eventually China were able to use the port of Guadar as a military base. No one would be surprised if China did use it in that way. I don't think in the short term, like it is set up in Djibouti, where it has a permanent base. I think it's more likely to use it as almost like a sort of forward base to resupply option, something it can use when it wants to. Other projects like building Pakistan's largest airport in Guadar and two special economic zones have been delayed. A 19 kilometer highway linking the port with the Macarang Coastal Highway in Balochistan is under construction too. Most of the people who live there and work there already are fishermen, they rely on access to the sea. The way that the express highway from the port was originally proposed would have cut off their sea access. And so that was a real point of contention with the community. There have been some proposals to allow them at underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built, there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower, of course, in Guadar. It's a very small city. And so one proposal has been well, we'll just ship Chinese workers in from China and build lots of fancy housing for them. The first Chinese-built community in Pakistan, a $500 million development, spanning over 10 million square feet with over 60% open spaces. That kind of proposal is what makes a lot of the Pakistani local people quite upset. A Guadal-based journalist expressed concerns to Bloomberg over projects like this. The journalist spoke anonymously for fear of persecution from the Pakistan government. These projects are creating jobs, but they're not really creating jobs for the local people of Guadar. They're not against economic prosperity, but they're against the development that leads them behind. Pakistan doesn't have the money to build these projects. It's gone to the IMF for its 13th bailout since the 1980s. By engaging in CPEC projects, the government of Pakistan has incurred more debts from China. Not only posing challenges for Pakistan, but possibly the international community if Pakistan eventually defaults on its debts. But CPEC is still set to go on. Even if most current projects haven't been completed, the two countries have recently signed new projects worth $11 billion. Pakistan's Prime Minister said the country's economic future is linked with China. It's hard to imagine how the China-Pakistan economic quarter is going to be the game changer that the Pakistan government would like it to be. We're not seeing the economic growth of benefit from the projects that were set out and we're supposed to see by now. We're not seeing the job creation. Project delays accumulating debts commercial viability. These problems of CPEC are also typical of Belt and Road projects around the world. For China, though, it's never the narrow accounting perspective that matters. It's the bigger strategic benefits. As China's dollars continue to flow, as China's concrete continues to pour, China's influence continues to increase.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2970,2022-10-15 00:57:50
14745,"..... There was some degree of runaway expectations. I think there was also some degree that they weren't extremely forthcoming with the state of the game. The Cyberpunk 2077 story is very much kind of a story of everything that can and will go rock in game development. The release of Cyberpunk 2077 in December of 2020 will go down as one of the most disastrous game launches in history, and it instantly rewrote the narrative of its celebrated developer CD Projekt Red. Larger studios with bigger budgets weren't able to create the same quality of open world game. The inside story of the making of Cyberpunk depicts a process marred by unchecked ambition, unrealistic timelines, and a focus on marketing at the expense of development. When CD Projekt Stock was at its high, it was the largest stock in the Polish stock market. Cyberpunk was supposed to be the biggest game of 2020. This was a game that was starring Keanu Reeves. This is a game that was from the makers of the Witcher 3. This was supposed to be the big temple release of last year, and for it to become such a disaster for so many people, I think, will have pretty far reaching consequences. CD Projekt Origins are somewhat unique in the game's industry. In the West and Japan, the late 80s and 90s were dominated by games through the home console market, and characters like Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog were becoming household names. The same was not true in a post-Soviet and economically depressed Poland. Most games were done on PCs, and most games were copied and sold in small markets around the country. You could go to the market down the street in Warsaw and buy in cell CDs, and these two guys, Marchiniewinsky and Michal Kaczynski, decided they were going to start selling CDs, and they wound up striking a deal with the people who made a game called Baldur's Gate, which is the seminal role-playing game in the late 90s. CD Projekt, named for selling CDs, would move on from just reselling games to localizing Western and Japanese made games into the Polish language, but it wasn't until 2002 that the company would make its own game, The Witcher. The Witcher is a huge, huge series, huge fantasy series in Poland, and so it was a pretty big deal that these guys got the race to make the video games. The Witcher book series is a source of national pride in Poland, and a CD project released The Witcher 2. The video game series would become an important economic symbol for Poland as well. CD Projekt Greta became this behemoth of an institution in Poland, and they were really big in the Polish technology scene because they were getting more worldwide attention than most Polish companies do, and making a lot of money. And in 2011, when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of The Witcher 2. I confess, I'm not very good at video games, but...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2971,2022-10-15 01:02:05
14746," 11 when Barack Obama came to visit Poland, the Prime Minister actually gave him a copy of the Witcher 2. I confess I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. But it would be the launch of the Witcher 3 in 2015 that would elevate CD Projekt Red from representing the best of Poland to representing the best of the games industry. I mean really the thing people look for first and foremost I think is that the game is just good and Witcher 3 was just a phenomenal game. There's a level of just storytelling, an emphasis on making every side quest count on top of the atmosphere, the dialogue, the character interactions, the different way stories can end. They nail that. Other open world games felt empty and forced and the developers of them gave excuses as to why there couldn't be more rich story or interactions and the Witcher 3 blew them out of the water. CD Projekt Red was beloved. They were seen as a studio that was willing to make what the player wanted and to truly put in the love and effort required to make a high quality game that really connects with the people playing with it. And the winner for Game of the Year 2015 is The Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 would go into an over 250 game of the year award, but along with being a critical success for CD Projekt it was also a financial success. Estimates put the sales of Witcher 3 at around 28 million copies in 2019. A huge step up concerning by 2014 the Witcher and the Witcher 2 had only combined to sell 8 million copies. And with two large expansions for The Witcher 3, CD Projekt also helped separate themselves from other AAA publishers at the time. And the game award goes, oh man I have to pay a micro-transaction to unlock. That's so stupid that this has to hold on. I got this guys. Here we go. Other games and the most notorious one to do this was EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. They got really aggressive on micro-transactions in a game that already cost at least $60. You could have paid more if you bought the premium editions, but not only was it that they were being very aggressive and trying to get you to spend money, but you could actually get items that helped you win. Well gamers kind of draw the line in the sand there and they don't like them. CD Projekt had done this phenomenal job of marketing themselves as a gamer friendly company. We've said this a million times and I'll say it again word gamers first of all and we all like to be treated fairly. So it only makes sense that as developers we apply the same principle to everything we do here at CD Projekt Red. So giving everyone a bunch of free DLC wasn't absolutely no brainer. They said we're not going to sell you DLC that's like horse armor packs and other nonsense. We're going to just give you free stuff and then we're going to sell big expansions as part of the Witcher 3. And not only were they really good, they were offered at a fair price. And this is a company that was seen as just like a company that really cared about quality and cared about its customers and would not do anything to kind of screw fans over the way that that fans see that EA and Activision and all the other big publishers do. With a critically and financially successful game, as well as the goodwill from the gaming audience, all the focus would shift to CD Projekt's next release, Cyberpunk 2077.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2972,2022-10-15 01:06:32
14747," **Music** It's actually funny, they first announced it through like a press release and then they showed off a trailer at the beginning of 2013 that was like the CGI trailer of like a woman and there was all sorts of cool cyberpunk stuff flying cars lots of stuff but uh it wasn't really until after the Witcher 3 that cyberpunk began really like building up this feverish level of hype. CD Predic Red though wouldn't put out another trailer for Cyberpunk until 2018 at the E3 trade show and they showed off a it was like a two minute trailer of cyberpunk look pretty rad. And then they showed behind the scenes for E3 attendees for press and anyone else we could get a score an appointment in there um they showed this 45 minute demo and it blew people away. Welcome to the gameplay demo walkthrough of CD Project Red's upcoming title cyberpunk 2077. The gameplay you're about to see is from a work in progress version of the game. Everything you see is potentially subject to change. Holy f***ing f***ing. This if they can live up to what they showed me it's game over. It all looked incredibly impressive. They had enough action enough narrative beats with just the right amount of tension. They touted how each of these NPCs there are thousands of them each one with their own daily routines and everything. We've greatly enhanced our crowd and community system to create the most believable city in any open world game to do. So yeah so um people were certainly blown away by the demo at 1 E3 awards and just people left the theater just in awe. What they didn't know of course is that the demo was completely fake. Fake demos are common at E3 studios put together builds of games to show off what they intend the game to be like rather than the actual state of the game. What was unique about this demo was that it was impressively long. It kind of plays into this idea that CD Project is very much a marketing driven company and so demos were really really important to them. So it was really important that they make this demo blow people away which it did but that might have come at the cost of like some time they could have been spending on the game. A year later at E3 2019 fans would get another big surprise. Wow! No way! Oh what?! These will be all you can do. Of being there, of walking the streets of the future is really going to be breathtaking. You're a breathtaking. The Cyberpunk trailers showed gorgeous cities, beautiful lighting, really cutting-edge technology when it comes to the rendering of the game itself. People were very excited to be immersed in this gorgeous Cyberpunk world. They saw over 8 million pre-orders which is a ridiculously large amount for any title to sell, let alone pre-sell. When you saw the stock price start to go up and up and up into the right, pretty much in a straight line. If you just look at the polished stock market, like the Wig Index, when CD Project stock was at its high it was the largest stock in the index. And that was around the time that they announced that the game would be coming in April of 2020. Behind the Seaheens, people were pretty shocked that they were saying April. I don't think it's a single person who worked on that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2973,2022-10-15 01:10:47
14748," that game actually thought they had a chance of coming out in April of 2020. So in April of 2019, I published an article for Kotaku about the making of a game called Anthem, which was a game from Byware that was disastrous in many ways and the article kind of ran through why that was. And afterwards, I started hearing from other developers who had stories to share that they said sounded a whole lot like Anthem. The deadline is unrealistic, the direction keeps changing, things are floundering, we're going through a lot of problems, this sounds exactly like what you wrote about Anthem. Around that same time, perhaps coincidentally, I heard from the CEO of CD Projekt Red who wanted to reach out to me specifically to talk about Crunch. CD Projekt Red had a reputation for Crunch, especially during the development of Witcher 3. Their management wanted them to have a reputation for treating workers well and not forcing them to go through Crunch. So Marchinevinsky, who's the co-founder and co-CEO of CD Projekt Red, came to me and said, hey, I want to make a vow right now that we're not going to force anybody to Crunch, that people will not have to work mandatory overtime on this project. Over the course of reporting, Bloomberg has conducted interviews with more than 20 current and former CD Projekt staff. Most of whom requested anonymity, so as not to risk their careers, CD Projekt declined a comment on the process or provide interviews with the story. The company would end up delaying the game three different times, first pushing from an April 2020 release to September, then November, and once again to December 2020. In order to meet the deadline, the studio would scale down the size of Cyberwanks main city, as well as canceling some features, and while those measures helped, developers still said they were under significant crunch. Including one former audio programmer who claimed to work up to 13 hours a day, five days a week, and stating he had seen friends who had lost their families over this. This was not a big secret in the office that the game was not going to be ready, but a similar sort of thing happened with Witcher 3, and a similar sort of thing happens with a lot of games, where they don't seem ready until suddenly everything just clicks. Some of the best games ever made, like were created through this process. I don't know that it's the most efficient or the wisest way to make video games, but it's what a lot of people do. I think that management there has genuinely tried to change it, or at least said they wanted to change it, but it has proven very difficult to change that when you make games in this one specific way. Game studios, some of them see crunch is per their core culture, that all of their games that they've made under crunch have been successful, so it must be a core element to the magic recipe for creating good games, and that's really not the case. We've run studies and seen that at eight weeks of working 60 hours plus, the output of a professional is the same as if they were working 40 hours a week. So chronic overwork degrades how effective someone is to the point where then it becomes negative and overworking them is just getting a less and less productivity. And so these guys, the people at CD Projekt, having made the Witcher 3, we're kind of riding on that high, you could call it arrogance or confidence, or whenever you want to call it, of having made the Witcher 3. And I think that like having a certain level confidence can certainly be a good thing, but in this case, it could also be dangerous because it kind of blinded them to the reality, which was that this game wasn't going to call us.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2974,2022-10-15 01:15:09
14749," MUSIC Sony Pictures Entertainment is reeling from what may be the biggest and most devastating computer hacking in Hollywood's history. Hackers attacked in waves. First crippling Sony's internal systems, then leaking five Sony movies online. Today the US government pointed the finger of blame directly at North Korea for the devastating cyber attack against Sony Pictures. Sony pulling the plug on the interview saying it will not show the controversial comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korea's leader. The Sony Pictures hacking was taken very seriously because it wasn't attacked on the free world. What we have been building in terms of our civilization and our freedom and our ability to exchange information freely have been disrupted by a country that we knew very little about. North Korea has reportedly made attempts to steal COVID-19 vaccine technology by hacking from Citicle Giant Pfizer. The Justice Department has charged three North Korean hackers over a wide ranging scheme that included the attempt theft of billions of dollars for multiple companies. Despite so many attacks blamed on North Korea, there was not much known about the people behind the hacking attacks and my aim was to reveal who these people are and what they are like, what their operations are like and on what their dreams and fears were. My name is Sam Kim. I'm a reporter for Blue Murg News and I wrote a story for Business Week about North Korean hackers. My story is about people who are sent from North Korea to countries like China to hack for the regime, spy on enemies and make money. North Korea's cyber abilities began about in the 1970s with a lot of students going to countries like Russia, China and even East Germany to learn coding was aimed at improving the productivity of factories at home. But in some time in the 1980s and 1990s, the current leader Kim Jong-un's father, Kim Jong-un, thought that it would be a good idea to develop a team, an army of people who could hack for North Korea's military. So they began this team of, basically, hackers who would spy for the North Korean regime and also go out there and make hard currency for the regime. I think Kim Jong-un takes the hacking ability more seriously than his father. He also enjoys a bit of tech sadness as well. He's often shown traveling on his airplane where on the desk there's a Mac computer. He understands the importance of computers. He understands the importance of employing technology to improve productivity of his economy. North Korea is an isolated country with its economy pretty much the latter days nowadays. It's been under increasing pressure and sanctions from the US and the international community basically. It does not have the resources and money to build a kind of conventional weapons that other countries are able to build. So what happens is North Korea concentrates its resources on building nuclear arms and missiles, which exports called basically a symmetric weapons. It's the kind of weapons that gives North Korea an instant edge. Think of cyberhacking abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people and if you have the right training, you're...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2975,2022-10-15 01:19:21
14750," abilities in that context. It doesn't cost them much money, but if you have the right people, and if you have the right training, you are able to cultivate an army of people who are able to penetrate into computer systems of other countries. And that's what North Korea is after. But if you consider the fact that there are only about 1,000 IP addresses in North Korea available, and many of them are basically loaned from Chinese communications companies, you can kind of tell why North Korea is willing to send its hackers abroad rather than operate from within. What's the matter with operating from within? Well, first of all, it would mean that a lot of information would have to be coming in from the outside world, which could risk exposing the government and the people to whatever truth there might be about them. So they're sending their trained hackers to China and other countries where access to information is better. But at the same time, because these are allies, and also because they have their diplomats stationed in countries like these, like China, they're able to regulate and control these hackers better. But formally, North Korea denies engaging in hacking and describes accusations to that affect as enemy propaganda. It took me at least half a year to track down these people. It felt like a wild goose chase in the beginning, because see a lot of the people like these are protected by the government in South Korea. But at the end, I was able to find a person who had pretty extensive ties to the North Korean defective community here. And then I was also able to gain access to the people who had actually done programming hacking from North Korea before coming to South Korea. And Jung is one of them. Jung actually is not a real name. I knew before meeting Jung that he was in his late 30s. But when I actually met him, he looked at least a decade older. He wouldn't open up. I mean, it took me, I think at least an hour to make sure that he would trust me enough that he would share with me his life story. When he was first sent to China, he was a studio studying computer science at a university near the border with North Korea. And he came back and realized that there was a lot more to do in China because he had more access to information. And he asked that he be sent back to China. And there was also recruitment going on for people who would actually do coding officially, but really hacking from North Korea. So he applied and he got the job. Once he got to the border, he crossed by foot and from there, he took a bus. And then when he arrived at the station that he would spend years in later, he learned that the three-story building in the hall of the city was actually provided for free actually by a Chinese man who had business ties in North Korea. There were actually two other people that I had met. They all said that they go into this freelance website for programmers and clients from around the world would come and give them orders, give them jobs to do. Some of the jobs given to Jung were cracking open, commercially successful antivirus programs. And once he was able to open that up, he replicated that program into another product which his client would repackage as a whole different product to be sold to other people. He also created what we now call bots. They are very popular online games, including lineage. He would create a bot that would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without the users online.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2976,2022-10-15 01:23:46
14751," That would just roam around without any supervision from the user and basically trade items without a user on that game. He would grow that bond on lineage and sell it for almost $100. Another defector said the money from client was wired primarily via PayPal to accounts controlled by minors because they were the only ones with access to legitimate bank accounts. So I had to make at least $100,000 a year and he doesn't get to keep most of it. Actually most of the money goes to the minors to the North Korean regime. But if you don't meet the quota and the minors will make sure that they'll put enough pressure on you. And if that happens repeatedly, you will face the growing odds of being sent back home. Among the three people that I spoke to, there's a common thing that they all tell me which is that on every Saturday they have to do this propaganda session which is basically about gathering all the hackers together into a room and they have to recite whatever messages, whatever lines come from Pyongyang, about the Kim family, about socialism. If you're especially someone with a free set of mind, that's stressful. One person actually was really stressed out what he heard about North Korea. Once he was in China during the propaganda sessions, he just couldn't take it. Jong was a senior member of the unit that he belonged to and he was good at Chinese as well. Whenever a senior North Korean official came from North Korea to check on the hacking units in China, Jong would accompany that official. He doesn't provide me details but he calls it unsavory instant that happened between him and an official that he was traveling with. Seeing that altercation prompted him to defect. But there was no one that he could turn to after defecting. He would, in disguise, roam around China. He called me that he actually enjoyed it. He actually enjoyed the freedom of not being known to anybody. Just roaming around a country that was huge. How did he make the money that he needed to carry on? He did the same thing he did. You know, at the North Korean unit, he would take orders. He would reverse engineer a software to make money. But at one point, he said he was just sick and tired of all of a sudden. He wanted to find a place where he could just settle down and he contacted South Korean authorities. Now, he lives in Korea, he met a woman here. You know, last time I checked, they had a baby. He worked for a software company, ironically, an antivirus company. What keeps coming up in my head, even long after I spoke to these people, is there was one common thing about them, which was the sense of disillusionment. This day had access to outside information. One day, we were able to freely roam in the Internet. There was a spark. And one day, we realized that there is a discrepancy between what they think is really happening and what North Korea is telling them every Saturday morning. That's when the spark gets bigger. That little fire is what eventually drives them to decide to leave, even if it takes a huge risk on their lives.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2977,2022-10-15 01:28:03
14752," It takes a huge risk on their lives. It takes a huge risk on their lives. Step into the shopping center of the future. A world filled with exciting ideas. Since they started popping up in the 1950s, malls have been the quintessential American shopping experience. Useling temples dedicated to the wonders and excesses of retail, food service and entertainment, the rise of the mall coincided with the growth of the suburbs. The heyday of the malls really is the 1970s. Sometimes referred to as the malling of America. They really thrived at providing some sort of public gathering space, some sort of social life, in addition to actually giving people places to shop. Over the past few decades before then, lots of developers were building malls, and it kind of coincided with the growth of highways. So as more people started traveling and interstate started being built, developers really wanted to put something to attract people to stop. Take a look at an average American mall today, however, and you'll see a very different picture. Closed stores and empty hallways became the norm in many malls even before COVID-19 delivered them another set of problems in 2020. So what happened? This is the story of the rise and fall of American malls. When malls work best, they survived and thrived thanks to their anchor stores. Those are the stores that are on the edges of the malls and that are outward facing to the parking lot. So if you're a shopper, you're going to walk through one of these big, usually a department store. So if you're thinking about maces or sears or JC Penny, those are called the anchor stores. So once shoppers are done shopping there, maybe they wander to the middle part of the mall, shopping at the other apparel shops, or even going to buy some food. But you really had to have a reason for people to shop in the first place. Because anchors bring in all those people, they tend to pay very little rent. Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside the mall. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides.

14753," Around 80% of income from mall owners come from the inline stores inside them all. Over the past few decades, malls have been facing challenges from all sides. The first being, there's just too many of them. As early as in the 90s, the malls were beginning to compete with each other. We have a lot more retail-swear footage per capita than Canada. We have only seven times more retail-swear footage per capita than Europe. After the 2008 financial crisis lowered retail spending across the board, malls and especially their department stores also had to contend with a new challenge that was growing fast. malls started to suffer in the early 2000s with the rise of online shopping. Suddenly, they didn't have that captive audience who had to go to the mall to buy something. You didn't have to get up, get in your car, drive all the way to the mall and then see a bunch of other people. You can just do it from the comfort of your own. Department stores overall have become less relevant over the years. Many have fallen totally off and that's Sears, JC Penney, several bankruptcies in this space have really hurt the industry. But as department stores go, so does the mall, oftentimes. So if department stores start closing locations, that means they're usually leaving malls. This is the Greenbrire Mall in Southwest Atlanta, Georgia. It's in many ways emblematic of the problems facing malls today. It's been there since 1965, so for more than half of a century, it's been serving this area of Atlanta that's predominantly black and also as middle class neighborhood. It started with anchor stores, that were department stores. So you had JC Penney and then Riches, which was later bought by Macy's. So you had these two national chains. It had the first Chick-fil-A in a mall, like that type of format. So when you think about the history of malls, like Greenbrire had like the perfect template. But now Macy's will be exiting the mall, meaning that the mall will be left without an anchor, which is vital to attracting other shoppers to come into the stores. Greenbrire then because it's kind of an example or a test for all these other middleing malls across America about what do you do when these large department stores has a business decision on there and are trying to just stay in the high quality malls. How does a middleing mall survive? What's their next strategy? Greenbrire is a textbook example of how closely the deterioration of the middle class in the US is tied to the health of its malls. The median income for the surrounding area has reduced by $6,905 over the past 15 years to a total of $20,756 per year. And yet residents and store owners hope that Greenbrire mall will see better days. Malls are made up of the people and communities that help fuel them. Greenbrire is still a place that people go to and cherish, even if on paper it doesn't have the elements that make it a thriving mall. A lot of the existing constituents and residents there feel in many respects that they worked hard their whole lives to be able to experience the American dream, the single family suburb and house in a leafy yard near a big mall that had a great niece of these. They're very reluctant to see that taken away from them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2979,2022-10-15 01:36:43
14754," And you know, they're very reluctant to see that taken away from them. Now that Macy's is gone, Green Briar may try to take inspiration from what many malls were doing in the years following the financial crisis, focusing not on shopping, but experiences. That was a trend we were seeing, you know, in 2016 up into the pandemic pretty much. And by experiences, I mean everything as dramatic as a water park or hosting like concerts to have people want to come other than just to buy stuff. Having Instagramable moments, making sure your store is pretty that people want to take a photo and post it on Instagram or Twitter. Historically, the mall has always been a place for teenagers. You like to hang out, see your friends and also kind of be seen at the mall. And that hasn't completely changed like before the pandemic, about 95% of Gen Z. So today's teenagers had gone to a mall in a three month period. So teenagers are still going to the mall and they've always been key to having thriving malls because they're coming into their spending power. And once you went over teens, hopefully you're really winning over a loyal customer for life. But thanks to lockdowns across the country, most malls at one point or another were shuttered in 2020. That means no one using the multi billion dollar American Dream malls indoor ski slope. No one going to the King of Prussia malls indoor skydiving attraction. Basically, the pandemic gave malls what they didn't need. Another problem. What would your net income or net operating income have been in 2022 without COVID? And what is it now in a post COVID world? So our views is roughly 10% hit to net income over that period. That's Vince Taboni from the analytics from Green Street advisors, which rates American malls from eight to eight to eight. And if malls did have a report card, they wouldn't exactly make honor roll. Here in the US, out of the thousand malls in the country, there are roughly 250 malls, we grade a minus or better. And it's going to depend on a lot of the local dynamics, ownership decisions around how much money to invest in the property. We'll determine whether this mall can survive as retail or so, you know, rapidly melting ice cube. While there have been a few bankruptcies among real estate investment trusts that own mostly B2D malls in the past few years, A malls really are doing just fine. Some of the most productive shopping centers in the country are super high end. So I'm talking about Bal Harbor shops down in Miami, Florida. There is Americana man has it in Long Island's Gold Coast, the Grove in Los Angeles. These are places that have all high end stores and have done quite well. A lot of that has to do with efficiency of their properties, so their sales per square foot are really high. But also they've invested a lot in their actual mall, because it has to look beautiful. It has to have all the services that a wealthy shopper expects. So what will the future hold for less sought after malls that can't revive their golden years? For many of these malls, it will mean closure and then hopefully conversion. If they can't get a new use to come in, it's expensive, but you can just demolish it. And there are still quite a lot of sites just sitting waiting. Amazon has been picking up more and more of those building their fulfillment centers. Also, a lot of communities think this is an opportunity to redevelop, re-enhabit this dead mall, to help that community meet the challenges it was never originally designed for. The number one reuse of an existing mall is as workspace. It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. Number two, reuse of malls.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2980,2022-10-15 01:41:12
14755," It's actually pretty easy to just throw some carpeting down, cut a few more windows, and turn it into office space. Number two, reuse of malls is either medical, healthcare, or education. Lots of great examples of community colleges all the way down to elementary schools. Moving into malls, then the third strategy that I wish happened more is actually just demolishing the mall and re-grain it. Either reconstructing the wetlands that used to be there, and that frankly we never should have built on in the first place, or providing community parks and gardens. While most analysts say post-pandemic retail shopping could breathe some life back into the American mall, many are not long for this world. Depending on where you live, it might be time to make one last visit, grab some food, do some shopping, and say farewell. Music Music Music Music Music President Trump travelled to Utah today where he dramatically cut back the size of two national monuments in that state. When former President Donald Trump announced plans to scale back two national monuments in Utah, there was outcry from a lot of people. One company in particular. Patagonia really is a resistance brand. They embraced the liberal resistance against President Donald Trump, and really put themselves at the forefront of that movement. In 2017, it sued the Trump administration for sort of slashing the size of these two national monuments in Utah that were kind of mechas for climbers. It's said at the time joining the legal practice was both extraordinary and obvious. So the company's general counsel said it took exactly one email to the board to decide to actually do that. I send the case to still out. Well, I think the only thing this administration understands is lawsuits. We're losing this planet. And we have an evil government, and I'm not going to stand back and just let evil win. This year it got even more active, it changed its mission statement to quote, Patagonia isn't business to save our home planet. And then it manufactured these little tags on some of its clothes that if you flip them up, it says vote the assholes out. Very implicit running up to the election. And it launched a digital tool to help people find the polling place. And on that digital platform, it says vote the climate deniers out of office again and again on the loop. This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2981,2022-10-15 01:45:51
14756," This isn't the first time that taking a stand has paid off the Patagonia. The business which is now worth over a billion dollars was built on it. I couldn't care less about making more money, but by doing the right thing it always ends up making me more money. So is this all a strategy, a sort of premeditated strategy? Who knows, I mean Sean Arck's been very vocal from the start and makes no bones about. He calls himself a dirtbag climber and an accidental entrepreneur. So I don't think he's fudging this, but what's important is that it's sort of a textbook marriage of philanthropy and profit. If you want to understand the entrepreneur's study that you and I on the link with, because you know they're saying, you know, this sucks. And I'm going to do it my own way. Of course, like every other teenage kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. When I was 16 years old, I took off and drove across the country, went into the Wind River Range and discovered mountains. Patagonia was born out of rock climber, Avantio Manard's first business, Schuwenart Equipment, which made in soul climbing supplies. Ivan Schuwenart was a blacksmith in the 50s, and he started selling climbing gear out of the back of his car. That was less harmful to rock faces. This is sort of the origin story of the company. It's called itself the activist company, a activist company. Six months out of the year, Ivan Schuwenart is a blacksmith. He makes mountain climbing gear. The other half of the year he climbs. In 1968, Ivan Schuwenart and four friends, including Doug Tomkins, the late founders of the North Face brand, embarked on the ultimate road trip from California where they were based to Patagonia in Argentina. The mountains in a good mood, dazzling sun, calm air all day. If this weather holds, they could be on the summit within days. This trip became a documentary about these friends who were hippies in the 70s climbing in the semi-tree where the sport became a lifestyle. And how these friends became pioneer of the outdoor industry. Schuwenart moved from selling petons to polyester, and in the 70s Patagonia was born. In 1973, Schuwenart and his wife Melinda were in the very first Patagonia store in Ventura, California, where the company's headquarters remained today. Melinda Schuwenart was the driving force behind many of the employee benefits, like on-site childcare, that helped the company achieve an impressive 4% employee turnover rate. The retail and consumer product sector average is more than triple that at 13%. I do think that Patagonia was a leader, one of the first corporations to take into account the human capital and make sure that their staff, all their employees were cared for in many ways, not just wages, but also they just cared about their people. And knew that that's a good business model. Patagonia began donating 10% of its profits to grassroots organisations in 1985. This later became the 1% of sales that Schuwenart labels and Earth tax. I don't think it's philanthropy, it's rent for us living on this planet. While Patagonia was creating the blueprint of how to be a socially conscious brand, it was also turning a profit. It even made ink magazines list of the fastest growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2982,2022-10-15 01:49:51
14757," This growing privately held companies. So every time the company makes a decision to do something socially environmentally active, it is met with success and that isn't lost on Schoenart or any of the other leaders of the company. The more money Patagonia made, the more it gave away under its philanthropic program. Between 1989 and 1991, the payroll grew by 40%. But trouble was on the horizon. I think for 1991, we are looking at a recession. The question is how deep that recession is going to be and how long will be in it. Sales fell flat and the bank called in the company's revolving loans. A company that prided itself on taking care of its own laid off 120 people, roughly 20% of its workforce. That was when we decided that we were going to start doing things differently. We're going to start running the company as if it's going to be here 100 years. With a renewed sense of purpose, Patagonia was ready for what it called business unusual. It started with the costly move to recycle and organic materials before launching a clothing repair service to discourage fast fashion. And Patagonia's influence was growing. What was intended as Schoenart's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in time languages. What's interesting to me is that all this, I hate the term on brand, but it's very on brand. It really works for the kind of company he's created. It works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain. It all is very seamless in terms of the identity of him and the company and what it means in the marketplace. So over time, the company's mission and its marketing have become the same thing. The inflection point came in 2011, actually Black Friday, Patagonia took out a huge ad in the New York Times that said don't buy this jacket. And it's sort of got into the nitty-gritty on the carbon footprint and the water footprint that goes into a piece of a peril like a parke. And at the time Schoenart said the best jacket for our planet is one that already exists. So the company at that time said it needed to address the issue of consumerism, which coming from a for-profit business hits pretty hypocritical. As the company encouraged its customers to buy less, its annual sales increased by almost 40%. The stance of this is hypocritical is loud and constant. Any about consumerism in a critical light, well very much being a part of it. Fast fashion is top on the list of environmental destruction and not just destroying the environment but impacting human health. They are in the fashion industry, they're clothing retailer and to come head to head with that is courageous. In 2014, Rose Macaria was appointed as CEO. During the next six years, she grew Patagonia into a billion dollar company while also scaling up its environmental goals and bringing a more political voice to its activism. Ivana had this model where he was basically saying you can have a great business, you can make quality product, but you can also do the right thing by the environment, by your employees, by your community. And that to me was like the most holistic vision of business that I'd ever seen. So right now Patagonia has a team of about 20 people solely focused on activism and grants. And this all comes at a time in the past decade when consumers are paying much more attention to the social footprint of companies and where they buy their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years. Revenue and profit at the company are roughly quadrupled. It's private, but estimates are it does about a billion dollars and annual sales.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2983,2022-10-15 01:54:05
14758, by their goods. So what's happened is all this is good business for Patagonia in the past 10 years revenue and profit at the company of roughly quadruple. It's private but estimates are it does about a billion dollars in annual sales which is sizable and that's part of the reason why it's been such a fortuitous cycle as it's ramped up its activism and become more vocal on these things it's resonated with the market. As the company branched out into other areas including Adventure Capital Fund for Environmental Causes and Sustainable Food revenue reached a new peak of over one billion dollars in 2017 but this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavyweights like Nike who made thirty seven billion dollars that same year. Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized vests have become the go-to corporate uniform and the expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagonia. It's expensive stuff it's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism you know a lot of the more sustainable parts of this pie chain art there's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down the Patagucci label is is a symptom of that. So Patagonia products are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active. For instance you know people in finance where the Patagonia vests go to the office and that's because of the image that the the brand projects and so they have to leave with the fact although they you know preach for the environment and want to stand for good their victims of their own success. Patagonia set sales records in the first three years of the Trump administration now in 2020 things have changed. His COVID-19 brought the business world to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration Patagonia a point of Brian Gellert as CEO. As far as its CEO transition goes this one's happening quite strangely. There's no real budget for next year yet because of everything that's going on and all the uncertainty around that. Patagonia's new focus is going to be on forging a relationship with the Biden administration. It should be a more close relationship but Gellert still has his guard up. During the Obama administration they didn't always agree and he expects the same with Biden in the White House. They plan to bring litigation wherever needed against any government needed about the issues that they care about and that's climate change in the environment.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2984,2022-10-15 01:58:25
14759," The I think you built this. So this is all. This is new since the pandemic. We assume Googlers would want more indoor outdoor options. I mean, it's so exciting. It's such a fun. It is. It is. But I would say the thing we're really excited about are these new buildings because we were building sustainability into everything we do. So I'm really forward looking. Good? Yes.

14760," After graduating from Stanford herself and then earning a couple more advanced degrees, Poorat landed her first job on Wall Street in 1987, where she would spend almost three decades until Google's co-founders lured her to Silicon Valley. It's wonderful to be here with you. It's great to have you here at the Google Club. Thank you for having us. So we are at Google headquarters in Mountain View and at this very same time you are making massive investments in New York office real estate, you're expanding headcount in Atlanta and Chicago and Washington DC. What's the strategy behind all of this? Well at the core we believe in hybrid work. So we do want to bring people back on campuses but not full time. We're thinking it would probably be a three to work week but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip. So we are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint. And then we also wanted to make sure that we're meeting people where they want to be. And so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Sooner just told me that Googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode forever, like literally forever. Obviously you're embracing this massive cultural shift but what are the risks? What do you worry about? So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time, not do the commute, be able to deal with everything else in their life and coming into the office. So the risk is I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching being brought into meetings, all of the touch points that you have. And so I think that one of the most important things for all of us as leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead. We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent and make sure that we're continuing to reinforce all of those great practices while opening up new great practices. Speaking of your career, before you were CFO of AlphaBat, you were CFO of Morgan Stanley and you started your career on Wall Street in 1987. Talk to us about the journey of going from big banks to big tech. Why did you make that leap? And what impact did you want to have? Well I love being at Morgan Stanley and I became CFO the day James Gorman became CEO, yes, needed to join him in that journey and that was January 2010. And we were still recovering coming out of the financial crisis. There were still some pretty rocky days and a lot of decisions that needed to be made. And then I got to a point where I felt like we were in a great spot at Morgan Stanley and obviously it's continued to do really well. And I just wanted that next chapter. In my career, I've always been focused on continually learning and I feel like when you hit a plateau, the right questions, what's my highest and best use and it's been an extraordinary time. You also survived Wall Street in the 80s and 90s, which is notorious Boys Club. And Silicon Valley has sort of come to be known as a Boys Club of its own. How would you compare those two cultures? When I was starting my career many decades ago, it was tough and much worse than it is now and it evolved. No question about it. Not where it needs to be but certainly evolved and I saw it through my career. I would say the biggest difference out here is the level of impatience. And I love it. As the view is, if you can do some of the extraordinary breakthroughs that we have out here, if you can do natural language translation, everything we do with AI, with VR, with self-driving cars, why can't you fix this now? And that level of impatience I think is fantastic. Legend has it that when you got to Google, you were going to rain in the spending, tighten up on the moon shots. Your nickname I believe was Ruth Vader. Was that a tough job to take on? So I think the narrative was written before I got here. And what I find most interesting about that is I firmly believe the single most important thing in capital allocation is investing for long-term growth. I think if you don't, you are sowing the seeds of your long-term decline. And I learned that really early on in my career. As you can see there is the spring journey going on, I've heard alot having the impact of beyond that circle..... of course, that legacy was significantly further updated by the",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2986,2022-10-15 02:07:29

And I learned that really early on in my career, now if you're investing in an industry like this and trying to do truly transformative things, by definition, everything can't succeed. And so by definition, you should have the metrics and data and milestones to assess, is it working or is it not? Because if everything's working or if you think everything's working, I would say one or two things are wrong. Either you're not reaching high enough, or you're not being honest enough with yourself about the pace of breakthrough, whether you're going to get there. So to me, a really natural part, you know, kind of a sister organization to investing for long-term growth is actually thinking about how are you doing with the risks that you're taking, stack rack them, and figure out what's at the bottom so you can redeploy those resources to the top. They go together, actually. And so I find the narrative, it's a false choice to think that it's either about growth or it's about pruning stack ranking. They go together and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. You advised the Treasury Department during the Great Recession, what lessons did you take away from that? What struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times. So the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix. And so, you know, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly. And it would have been really easy six to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity. You couldn't do it in the moment. And so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate, you need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content, moderation, security. That is the foundation on which you can build everything else. The handpiles at one point said to me, you have to have the will and the means. And too often by the time you have the will, you no longer have the means. His comment was, be decisive, act early, even in the absence of information. I think that's true in this whole notion of investing for long-term growth. Because if you're not actually assessing progress along the way and you just assume, you know, we can keep investing in everything. At some point down the road, you'll say, I wish I had made those tough calls to double down on the things that really mattered. What times are we in now? What's your read on the economy today, especially with rising inflation? Well, I think back to March of 2020 and where we were. And I think of all of the intervention and steps that have been taken since then. And you've certainly seen the recovery coming out the back. And it's been really gratifying from those painful days to see the breakthroughs that we've had not just on the medical front, but we've also seen the improvement across businesses. I think one of the biggest concerns in particular is you're seeing us go through a digital transformation and the acceleration of it is ensuring that everyone has the skills, the digital training and skills to thrive in this new economy. Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? We often say that people come to Google not because they have to, but because they want to. It's really opening the world for so many people, so that's the intent.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2987,2022-10-15 02:11:33
14762," music I want to talk a little bit about regulation. You were drawn to M&A in your early days at Morgan Stanley. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions, deals that some think Google maybe would have wanted to win in a former life. Is antitrust scrutiny constraining any of your business plans and your ability to compete? So the main thing that we've done throughout our life of Google is really invest in innovation as organic growth and we're continuing to do that at a really rapid clip. We have then layered onto it, tuck in acquisitions and larger acquisitions and we're continuing to be active. We're more on the smaller ones and the add-ons to be fair, but we think there's a lot of opportunity still ahead of us. And so we're continuing to invest in partnerships and in some acquisitions and do you think that there's still upside in a lot of different areas? So would you say this regulatory scrutiny isn't slowing you down? It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues, what is that they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them. At the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar on everything we're doing, address what is most helpful for our users. Google is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies. How are those conversations with regulators going? Are they frustrating at this point? Well, there's certain elements that are frustrating because I listen to the outline of some of the proposed legislation and I think it's inconsistent with some of the priorities for public policy. So as an example, there are a lot of focus on what is called self-preferencing or you are putting too many of your own products together. But during the pandemic one in three small businesses said they would have failed without digital skills. Why? Because what they were able to do is connect with their users in different ways. So if you go search for a small business you can then go to a map and you can get directed to the small business. That's a good thing. We have 6,000 small businesses who wrote in and said you know what, we need these digital tools and skills. Same with a number of things on racial equity. Real surge in searches about where can I, where's a black owned business near me and the ability to direct people through search and maps. So I think that what's really important and that's why I said it's about constructive engagement, let's make sure we understand what they're trying to solve and work with them on what is it that we're trying to address through products so that the products are helpful in the ways that they want. Facebook has taken a serious reputational hit. Has that had ripple effects or created collateral damage for Google? Well, I think that whenever there's a backdrop that's challenging, it has ripple effects. But what we're really underscoring is all of the steps and investments that we are making to really protect the ecosystem the way we, our commitment to our users. So we know how sacrosanct that trust is and it's all about privacy and what are the steps that we're taking to make privacy protected for our users. What is it that we're looking at to protect content and content moderations? Google now reaches more than half the people on the planet. Why shouldn't we view Google as a monopoly? So you know, I go back to the earliest days when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998 and in those earliest days when I heard about this like eight search engine, the question is why do you?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2988,2022-10-15 02:15:46
14763," stays when Google, I first learned about Google back in 1998. And in those earliest days, when I heard about this like 8th search engine, the question is why do you actually need it? And back at Morgan Stanley, it's working with our research analyst, Mary Meekers, she actually had her team put up white pages all around the conference room and was doing this comparison. Well, provided the most responsive results most rapidly. And all of a sudden, you could see, well, when did this Google thing actually, maybe we do need something new. And that's been the ethos at Google since inception. It's just continued to innovate to make this 8th never better experience for users. And so if we can, if we can deliver on that, which is what drives people here, it's really opening the world for so many people. So that's the intent. Facebook and Twitter are exploring digital currency. What is your thought on the crypto market? And is there a play for Google? So we look at it. There's nothing to comment on now. I think we're much more interested in blockchain and the underlying technology and the implications for the business and also for the way we can support our cloud customers. So certainly a lot of effort there. There's considerable chatter in the crypto universe that Web 3 and the blockchain could circumvent the power of Facebook and Google and more. What do you think about the next frontier of the internet? At this point, I think there are a lot of different things ahead of us that are actually studyingly exciting that enable us to actually continue to address different needs and requirements. Like I look at, for example, in something like health, where I think blockchain will be very valuable when you think about health and health records. There are also a whole host of other areas where the data analytics that we provide are absolutely critical. Should we make excuses to our employers? Can we tell them if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss that I want to do that? You don't tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. Thank you. You survived breast cancer twice. What was your biggest fear at that time and how did you overcome it? Well, the biggest fear was I wouldn't make it and I remember when someone at some interview while I was going through chemo said, where do you want to be in five years and I froze because it was I want to be alive. And I learned a couple of really important things. One, given breakthroughs in medical technology, I learned to love the word manageable. This journey does become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is management.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2989,2022-10-15 02:20:04
14764," become manageable, not for all cancers, but for many more cancers. And that gave me a lot of confidence talking with other survivors about it is manageable, get the best care. And just plow through it. I was just very grateful. I'm grateful for all of the investments people have made over the years, but for anybody out there, and I think everybody sadly will be touched by cancer either themselves or someone they know and love. Many of these cancers are manageable and just go at it with gusto. So that's what I did. You're a mom of three sons, and I find that especially remarkable because I also have three sons. How have you managed that over the course of this, you know, incredible career? How do you find that right mix of focus and free time to spend time with your family and doing the things that you love? So my kids, my kids give me energy. They're remarkable. And I think one of the important things for me is this notion that you do have to have a mix. It's not about trying to find balance, the physics of which is really challenging. I think when people try for balance, they always feel they're failing on something because something's out of whack. So this metaphor that life is like a kaleidoscope, and you need to have different shaped pieces of glass and different color. And sometimes one is larger than the other. And what's beautiful about life is when it's constantly moving around. And so to me that metaphor has actually been sort of an anchoring principle. The other is you have to put the kids first. So like they know that I'm there when they need always. And I think that just making sure that you're setting the boundaries the way you need to, I would say it's much easier today than when I was growing up in banking. You know, we had a cubicle. There was a, there was a computer room, you were anchored to the computer room. One of the many beautiful things about going through this evolution in work is understanding that hybrid works. So how do we get rid of mom guilt? Especially in this new work world. I want to shake my mom guilt. How do I do that? Okay, so even when you feel it to say, you know what, it's an investment in my career because I can stay in this longer and be operating at a higher level. If I'm really getting the stimulus from all parts of my life. So you've got to drop the mom guilt. And when on the other side mom guilt with kids, I think they get it. I think they understand what we're doing. And you know, never forget during the financial crisis at one point I was working on AIG. We went around the clock. I came home to shower that one like right as we were landing AIG and my three kids had each written me a yellow sticky note with a message on it. And one of them was based, you know, the the the the essence of which was I get why you're doing this. And it and they saw it as the right thing for the country. I don't need to over dramatize what it was, but that's what it felt like at the time. And that level of pride I still have those three stickies right by my bedside because I get it. I get the mom guilt. I wish there were certain elements I could could have done differently. But I also see the relationship we have and they understand what it means to actually be engaged in society and doing something you care about. No mom guilt mom guilt. Thank you. It's not allowed. Thank you. Should we make excuses to our employers? Should we tell our like if I have to head to a parent teacher conference or take a kid to the doctor, do I tell my boss? You don't tell your boss. You don't tell your boss. Guys don't tell their boss. So what do we say? I don't think you say anything. I actually made this point at an event at Morgan's down. I'm like, do not tell your boss. You've got to get over the guilt. The only way to move on from it is realize I'm a professional. I do things when I when I can and it makes sense and I get it all done. I just do it on my own timeline. And I actually had a woman who emailed to me afterwards and said, I know you said I'm not supposed to tell my boss. So I won't. But I can't not tell somebody. So I'm going to email you. And I'm like, okay, that's step one of five step journey. Do not tell your boss. Tell your boss, you know what? I need to do certain things for myself and I'm getting I feel guilty doing it but I get everything done. There's no question. You are so beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Do not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation and people are reflecting and changing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2990,2022-10-15 02:24:39
14765," So beyond having to check in with people. Well, thank you. Thank you. To not. We're in the middle of this so-called great resignation. And people are reflecting and changing and making big decisions. What's your advice to people in this big evolution? Huge choices ahead. Well, I think you framed it really well. I don't think it's the great resignation. I think it's the great reshuffle. And people are reflecting on what do they want? And how do they want to work? And how do they want to live their life? So I think for all of us thinking about what does that mean for our institutions, it is about evolving the way we work, the way we interact, the expectations that we have to say, but I grew up in a cubicle on the 26th floor of a skyrise. It doesn't work anymore. And so what should we do as leaders? And I think that this generation appropriately, and it's very exciting, expects more from all of us. And so it's not just in how we work, but it is in what we do. And I think all elements of what's the mission? Are you delivering on the mission? Is really important. OK, so if you rapid fire questions, someone you'd love to have dinner with? Well, I'd love to say my parents, because they passed away in over years ago. Favorite family ritual? We do this crazy thing that we've done for years, which is everybody gets to pick where we travel. We come up with the five different locations, and then we all vote, and then we get the grid. And that's where we go. What's your favorite getaway? Probably, I would say maybe Iceland was the vast. That's an amazing one. New York or California? Oh, it's so unfair. Well, sitting here outdoors right now, and knowing I can do that for the rest of the years for you nice, for the energy from New York. So I'm not going to, it's like, my pick amongst children. So, in closing, Google is a massive company, multiple divisions, many bets. Where are you spending most of your time now? I'm spending most of my time on your very important question about capital allocation, because if it really goes to this core point, you've got to invest for long-term growth, and making sure that you're investing with the right intensity, I often say, I don't want to get to the two-yard line, but not score. So you need to make sure you're investing with the right intensity to support long-term growth. That's the most important area where I would say I spend the bulk of my time. And then, of course, you have to prioritize in order to recycle to support those efforts. What kind of discussions are you having with Larry and Sergey now about this next phase of Google? So when they made the announcement about the role change, they were very serious about moving to this board role, and they're amazing board members. Sundar, of course, relies on them for council wherever whenever, but most of the interaction is really around what are we doing at the board level? It's been great. And you have your freedom to allocate capital as you like. I work closely with Sundar and Phil and Tom. Yes, we work as a great team. So what's the vision for Google then 10 years from now? It's fascinating to, I think I have the same reaction you do when I heard Sundar say search is the biggest moonshot. And I think that continuing to find ways to be helpful to users to solve what they need where. So many people are coming online, and it is video going to be the way they understand it's going to be about, search is going to be a different type of experience. So much of it's going to be about voice first and language translation. So it's going to continue to evolve. And what about for you personally? Where will you, you know, it's been so amazing to hear about your journey, and I'm just curious about your personal growth. What you feel you've accomplished in the last, you know, since you've been here and what you hope to accomplish. I find that the opportunity to try new things and to invest in new things, and as we think about, well, what does that mean for each one of our areas? There's, I think that intellectual curiosity keeps you young. And I think that continuing to learn is like your brain, it's like silly putty getting pulled in a lot of directions. So to me, it's continuous learning. Reaport at thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful to be here. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Thank you. Come back anytime. She has worked hard by myself and she's having a breaking understand of it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2991,2022-10-15 02:29:08
14766," For at thank you so much for joining us. It's been wonderful. Thank you. Great to have you on campus. Come back anytime. Thank you so much for doing this. Well thanks for doing it. So sorry I'm late and I'm coming late for it. Not at all. It gave us more chance to tweak the lights for the 50,000th time. So you're doing well? Yes. How often are you coming into the office these days? About two to three days a week. Yeah. How about you? I guess you come in. Yeah, I'm in every day now. So no more kids on the set. I have to ask is your son still mining Ethereum? He and I literally were talking about it last night. He's like, Dad, you are the one who made me give up on it. I'm like, no, no, I didn't. But yeah, the thing that's good about this is I think it excites a whole new generation about technology, which is good. I really appreciate taking this time. Well, thank you for doing it and thank you for coming down to do it. I'm ready to go and you guys are. From Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, this is Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Alphabet CEO, Adar Pichai. Ford and raised in India. Pichai had almost no access to a computer until college. But just years later, found himself rising through the ranks of the world's largest search engine. In 2015, it was Pichai that Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin chose to run Google and later Alphabet. Now valued at more than $2 trillion, it's one of the most powerful companies on the planet. Sundar, it's great to be with you today. Thanks for doing this. Great to be here in person. Google just hit a $2 trillion market cap. Alphabet, I should say. Where is the next trillion dollars going to come from? You know, I've always felt your market cap valuation is an effect of the value you provide. And I feel fortunate, our mission is timeless. There is more need to organize information than ever before. I still feel searches our biggest moonshot as a company. People will want radically more conversational experiences. They will want what we call multimodal experiences. They may speak to search. They may look at something and ask what the information is. Being able to adapt to all that and evolve search will continue to be the biggest opportunity. We are so excited about the YouTube cloud or hardware products, Google Play. So we're building a diverse set of businesses. But underlying all of it is the investments we are making in AI. We've invested $100 billion in R&D in the past five years. And so applying AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2992,2022-10-15 02:33:10
14767," AI in a deep way is probably where we will create the biggest opportunity ahead. Microsoft is making some big acquisitions. Apple's anti-adtracking technology is shaking up the industry. What do you make of these competitive moves? Your competitors say they're on the right side of history. Are they? I look at the fact that there are three billion people who have access to knowledge of their fingertips. I look at the opportunity we provide. I look at the skills people are learning through YouTube. You know, I feel that everywhere when I go talk to people and and providing access to information and knowledge, I think we'll end up being on the right side of history as well. Your predecessor, Eric Schmidt, told me that he feels the latest Facebook revelations are disturbing. Google also has access to massive amounts of our data. Why should half the world's population, more than half the world's population, trust Google to do the right thing? We are trying to do more with less data. One of the biggest changes we made was making auto-delete the default setting for new users signing in and now over two billion users have their data continuously being deleted. Look, we rely on trust for people, you know, every day when people come to Google, you know, they place their trust in us in vulnerable moments, maybe a healthy shoe on which they are trying to understand. You know, there's no more important responsibility we have than doing right by that trust. You know, when we provide Gmail to journalists and realize that their accounts may be under attack by an authoritarian government, I mean, that's what motivates us to make sure be privacy, be security, be trust. We are doing the right thing. Over time, regulation will have an important role to play here. I think privacy regulation is important in areas like AI regulation will be important. And so, I think, you know, those will be part of the answers as well. The Facebook fallout, that Instagram can be toxic to teens, for example, has this raised more or new concerns for you about the impact of technology, addiction, algorithms, YouTube even, on our children and their development and their mental health. I mean, you're a parent and you also have a lot of power over how this plays out. You know, I mean, like you, you know, bringing kids up in this modern digital world is something I think all parents are anxious about rightfully so. I think, you know, it's part of why a few years ago when in YouTube, you know, we were exposed to a set of concerns. You know, we invested. It became our number one priority to work harder. The reason YouTube invested so much in developing YouTube kids as a safe destination for young children and so on. The technology is going to play a big role in helping give children the next wave of opportunity as well. So, the answer is to develop it responsibly. We have changed our balance in these areas and saying, we think about content responsibility first and then the pace of development or new features in areas like YouTube. And so, that's how we approach it for a while. Facebook and Microsoft are all in on the metaverse. What do you think about the metaverse? What's Google's metaverse strategy? It's always been obvious to me that computing over time will adapt to people and people adapting to computers. You know, you won't always interact with computing in a black rectangle in front of you. So, just like you speak to people, you see and interact. Computers will become more immersive. They'll be there when you need it to be. So, it's always been excited about the future of immersive computing and being computing AR. And we are in that count as the metaverse. Is that what that is? You know, metaverse is, I think it means different things to different people. The way I think about it is evolving computing in an immersive way with augmented reality. As part of that, there'll be many experiences, some of which will be immersive, interactive virtual worlds, which is the metaverse concept. But I think this doesn't belong to any company. This is the evolution of internet and the web, the internet, all of it will continue to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible. They can be flexible.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2993,2022-10-15 02:37:32
14768," to evolve. Google was famous for its campuses, where you could go and never leave. You had everything you ever wanted. Now, you've said they can be flexible. They can work from home. They can work at the office. They can be hybrid. They can work remotely, permanently, perhaps. Are you committed to really letting them do this forever? And if so, how does that change the future of work and society? Look, we've really embraced the fact that the future is going to be flexible. At Google, we've always tried to give agency to our employees. But we do realize the importance of bringing people together the creativity, community, and collaboration that comes with it. So the balance we are striking is this notion of 3.2. And what we are giving, the strength of our companies, we have more locations than most of the companies. So we're giving people a choice to move anywhere in the world. Four weeks they can work from anywhere. We're going to accommodate 20% of our workforce to be remote over time. So we're going to embrace that flexibility. Forever. Forever. Yeah. And we're committed to it. Through it all, it forces us to design better products. And since people use Google Workspace to run their companies, I think gives us a chance to innovate and bring all that out. I think there is so much value in giving people more flexibility between their personal and professional lives. And I think it will lead to people being happier. And I think companies can be successful in that model. And so we are trying to get the best of both worlds, but embrace the flexibility and see where we go. How confident are you that when you look back, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world? We are putting so much energy and resource into it. There's a way to grow up. I've learnt that people are going to save money. I don't know how much it helpsas, IDK ads, I think I just know as a young person who works You grew up in India, you lived through droughts, water was scarce. How has that experienced shaped your feelings about the urgency of stopping climate change? You know, I grew up in Chennai, India, and a big part of my childhood was, you know, really pretty severe water scarcity, you know, we would get water trapped in for the streets and standing lines and carry a few buckets of water at home. There was no running water for many years. And, you know, but fast forward a few years ago, you know, Chennai had one in a hundred year flood, you know, which was a very extreme event, kind of drove home. That combined with a few years ago waking up to the orange skies here in the Bay Area, being the look of concern on my children's faces and having to explain it, you know, all kind of drove home in a deeply personal way for me. So I think it's the most defining issue we all face.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2994,2022-10-15 02:42:09
14769," So I think it's the most defining issue we all face and you know definitely something very motivated on working towards. I remember waking up to those orange skies too and having to have that same conversation with my kids. Do you think the commitments at COP26 went far enough? You know, encouraged by many things, you know, we have to tip our hat to the people who are working super hard. The issues and the trade-offs are genuinely difficult, you know, you have to keep the economies growing. You know, it really matters and but at the same time it's a pretty severe urgent issue. So I'm encouraged by the progress. I think it builds on the Paris agreement so I can see the forward progress. There is the deep anxiety that it all may not be enough. But you know, we have to be optimistic and keep pushing. Google has set some aggressive targets to run entirely on clean energy to be the first tech giant to do so 24 hours a day. How confident are you that when you look back on this time, let's say a decade from now, you'll be able to say Google did enough to help save the world. We are putting so much energy and resources into it. It's always been kind of a founding value for us. We've been carbon neutral since 2007. We've been matching our energy consumption with renewable energy over the past few years. So this, you know, we are now pushing its moonshot to be 24, 7 carbon free. That means every search you do, every email you send that we can do it carbon free. We were at 61% in 2019. The number is now 67%. We have set our goals to be 100% by 2030. And to do it globally, that means we have to solve new things which we haven't done before. Wind and solar alone won't be enough. We just started geothermal and Nevada. We will be investing in newer technologies, including carbon capture, etc. over time. So that's what excites me. We are a technology company at heart. So part of there are many answers to this problem. Some of it is that we are going to have to innovate our way out of it. And, you know, we want to push as hard as possible in doing that. Our Bloomberg New Economy Forum is happening this year in Singapore. And the Asia Pacific region is one of the fastest growing internet economies on the planet. Where do you see the most room, the most opportunity for Google to grow there? You know, it's such a fencing time frame. You know, glad you're focused on the region. It's the most vibrant region we see. It's our 20th year since we opened our office in Tokyo. It was the first office outside the Bay Area. You have two and a half billion people on the internet. There are many areas in which they are, they are leapfrogging trends, which are here and embracing the future digital payments is a great example. So many of our products originated from APAC, Google Maps, Google Pay. A lot of our journey to bring computing to more people is playing out in Asia as well. I am excited about also the work we are doing through cloud because the companies that are rapidly transforming themselves digitally. The chance to provide that is something very exciting for us. So super dynamic region. I feel like we are learning as Google being in the region. And so I think it will transform the first 10 years I would have said we took products here and brought it to APAC. For the past few years, we are beginning to build things there. And some of our future global products will be APAC first and rest of the world later. We will talk about APAC without talking about China and your facing stiff competition from Chinese tech giants there and beyond. What should US policymakers know about competing with China? There is a lot of conversations about US and China, the competition is fierce. Many of the areas like AI and quantum computing where we are investing a lot. The Chinese companies are neck to neck. What I think about, you know, was encouraged by the news coming out of Glasgow, about the US-China agreement on climate. To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas which are common challenges for all of humanity. The pandemic was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2995,2022-10-15 02:46:17
14770," To me, while we talk about all the areas where we are competing, some of the biggest areas, which are common challenges for all of humanity, the pandemic was one, AI and AI safety over time will be a shared one, obviously sustainability is another area like that. So I think these are all areas in which the countries can come together and so I think that's a way by which we think about as, you know, when we compete on the internet and there may be different visions of how the internet plays out. So I see opportunities both sides. What are the chances that Google search will ever come back to China or that Google Cloud would ever come to China? You know, today we don't provide most of our signed-in services in China and I don't see that changing. But you know, there are ways, as I said, in areas like AI or sustainability, I think there will be opportunities for us to work together. Through Cloud, we will support multinational companies which have presents everywhere and so maybe there are opportunities to work that way as well. AI is advancing at an astonishing rate and it is hard to understand sometimes what this really means. In concrete terms, how will our lives look different? Let's say 10 years from now as a result of AI. You know, done correctly, you know, in many ways it's going to be helpful to you. You'll take it for granted. The same way today, for example, in India, over one-third of the queries on many phones come through voice. That is something people take for granted. You can do it. So over time, you will expect to speak and be able to understand any language in the world. And you know, those are always it's going to make it better. You may go to a doctor's office and go through a scan and the system may be prioritizing for the radiologist so that they don't miss some important things, maybe giving them a second opinion. You know, so these are all ways in which it will seamlessly start playing a role and I think we'll see that. You mentioned if done correctly and there are concerns, there are fears that AI will replicate the worst of society even under Google's own roof from your own researchers. What scares you most about AI? What keeps you up at night? It's the most profound thing we are working on as humanity and any time you're developing technology, there is a dual site to it. The journey of humanity is harnessing the benefits while minimizing the downsides. The good thing with AI is it's both going to take time. I think I've seen more focus on the downsides early on than most of the technology we've developed. So in some ways, I'm encouraged by how much concern there is. And you're right, even within Google, you know, people think about it deeply, we publish a lot of research. There are, I think it's more important that there are outside academic institutions, governments, nonprofits looking at this issue as well. So I think it'll be an issue which will have a lot of attention which gives me a lot of comfort as well. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? Cooking pizza, this learning cook which I was never good at. It's a bit of a cardinal, a little bit better.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2996,2022-10-15 02:50:54
14771," When I was just eating, I was going to day off. We are still going. Look, I'm sweating. So I used the Georgia for 30 days. besides getting LDL, if II can't wait. The winter is starting to get hot. You have presided over Google through massive social movements that reverberated in and outside the company. What have you learned as CEO since the walkout? For me, it was a moment, I think it changed the company for the better. We've always been committed. It gave us an insight on what more we could do. We undertook deep commitments. The biggest overall and diversity and inclusion, I think if you're committed and you actually put in the effort behind it, you can make a difference. Now we have stated clear goals. We don't track to meet those goals. But it forced us to think about new answers. For example, tech companies used to talk about the pipeline problem, but we are now going to places where the talent is. We are working much harder, going to Atlanta, going to DC, going to Chicago, going to New York. That's improving our diversity and representation at all levels. The war for talent is even more competitive now in this new world. What are you offering? Elon Musk has said, big tech is a place where talent goes to die. How do you respond to that? I look at the fact that we are looking to hire 30,000 people next year. I look at the impact we have on many people coming and working in the latest cutting-edge things. Many people come and people leave Google. We are proud of people who have left Google. I think there are over 2,000 companies that have been started by whom we call as Zublers. I'm equally proud of that. I think we are one part of a big system. I think I'm proud of the role we play in bringing in people and the impact they have over time and outside world. That's most of the heavy stuff out of the way. We're going to do some rapid fire just to get to know you a little bit better. You said you'd pick up some new hobbies in the pandemic. What did you start? I started cooking pizza, just learning to cook, which I was never good at. I've gotten a little bit better. Cricket or soccer slash football? Wow, stuff. Both. Please don't make use. Okay. Squid Game or Ted Lasso? I watched both. The Ted Lasso is much more common. I'd rather take Ted Lasso over-scoot games any day. I know you're a voracious reader. What's the last good book that you read? I've been on a podcast bench. It's a lot more podcasts than books nowadays. Okay. Favorite videos you watch on YouTube with your kids? A lot of music videos. Music videos. This whole notion where creators are watching other things and commenting on it. It's a trend which my kids are really into. And I've kind of gotten used to it now. So watching other games, it's a phenomenon. Screen time policy that's worked for you as a parent. You know what's not worked? You know, I've kind of given agency to my kids. The only thing I tell them is that I can look at their digital well-being once in a while with them. And so- How do you do that? I asked them to show it to me and they show it on their phones. So, you know, so that's pretty much the only thing. So beyond that, you know, it's agency and talking to them about it and making sure we are spending time doing other things. Making sure they develop good habits, basically. Metaverse or real world? Done correctly. You know, you shouldn't feel the need to make a choice. You know, you always want to be present in the real world. And when you feel the need to do something, you want to do that. You know, I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2997,2022-10-15 02:55:04
14772, present in the real world and when you feel the need to do something you want to do that but you know I do think presence and the realness of the real world will end up matting for humans for a long time. Do you own any crypto? I wish I did I've dabbled in it but you know in and out. In and out okay um Larry and Sergey I'm not going to make you choose how many times a week do you talk to them? I talk to them regularly you know it kind of ebbs and flows you know and so there are times we get excited about something and we spend a lot of time talking it through but it depends on you know what what I mean. A piece of advice you wish you had in your 20s and a piece of advice you wish you had in your 40s. 20s would be you know being patient you know I think when you're young you're very impatient which is a great thing but sometimes you do amazing things by slowing down and being really focused and doing it over a period of time and so I would advise the young you know the younger version of me to be more patient maybe at 40 I would say you know when I look at climate and I want want all of us to be impatient so you know I feel like when there's an urgency towards something and I think the world needs to be impatient so that's that advice I would give to a older version of me. How much do you personally wrestle with the decisions that you have to make and how much longer do you see yourself being the CEO of alphabet not just alphabet but also Google? Yeah on the look on the first one there are moments we all have to make tough decisions and you know in some decisions way on me and but I it's a privilege to do it I have very good people helping me think things through so I think the combination makes it all you know fine. On the second thing I am looking at it I'm so energized by the things we need to do you know I didn't have much access to computing growing up it changed my life a lot the one laptop a child goal really motivated me to come into technology and when I look at last week us launching a affordable smartphone in India the chance to bring the next billion users in Asia and in Africa online that gives me a lot of energy. We'll be watching from afar Sundar Pachai thank you so much for joining us thanks Emily. Pleasure to be here. How ever you get your new Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake Bloomberg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. On TV Radio and the Web this is Bloomberg.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2998,2022-10-15 02:59:09
14773," Music Jeff Bezos shocked the world when he stepped down a CEO of Amazon. Less shocking was his choice for successor. Jay Jassy was not only one of his longest tenured lieutenants, but the architect of Amazon's multi-billion dollar cloud business, Amazon Web Services, a moonshot that helped transform Amazon into not just e-commerce, but enterprise juggernaut. Jassy then needed to find his own successor, tapping a former colleague who helped grow AWS in its earliest days, but had since left to run Seattle software giant Tableau. His job to continue the reinvention of AWS and in turn, Amazon. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, new AWS CEO, Adam Salipski. You worked for AWS for 11 years and then went on to become CEO of Tableau Software in 2016. Then you get a call from Amazon to come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one-on-one at my prior company.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2999,2022-10-15 03:03:34
14774," Come back and run AWS as CEO. Tell me about that call. Well, I was having a one on one at my prior company and my app old news alerts went off like everybody else's did and it's a Jeff Bezos is taking on a new role and Andy Jassy is taking on the CEO role of Amazon. And of course Andy and I worked shoulder to shoulder about 20 feet apart for 11 years. So of course I reached out and congratulated him and we started talking and the conversation turned to some of the possibilities and next thing I know a little while later. Here I am back at Amazon, absolutely delighted and honored to be the CEO of AWS and helping to shepherd this amazing business for our customers. In that process did you talk to Jeff as well? I had some communication but it was you know principle with Andy who of course was you know knew the AWS business best and of course was taking on the CEO role but yeah there was you know contact as you might expect with a small handful of other people. So what did Andy tell you he wanted in the next chapter for AWS? Andy reminded me nothing I needed reminding but that it has really still day one for AWS and for our customers. It is still so early in this business and we shouldn't think that just because the business has grown rapidly or just because we're currently the leader in the in the cloud that it's anything close to mature and so he really reminded me that we have to stay hungry innovate as quickly as we ever have done in the past. You're about half a year into the job. What changed while you were gone that surprised you? Well I think that so many more customers have really adopted the cloud and really decided that they're going all in. So I mean it was a pretty decent size business when I left but it's really grown and the customer base is really expanded and so now we have very deep relationships at the CEO level the CIO level across every country every industry every use case and we're regularly interacting with the most senior people at our client organizations. So you were working at real networks in the early 2000s and I understand you were offered a job at AWS without even really knowing what it was. I guess AWS was in stealth mode. Well it was very secret so it was it was it was hard that the company didn't want to talk too much about it but of course you know we had to talk a certain amount about it. So the call I got when something like we have this initiative to turn the guts of Amazon inside out and expose it to other people and it sounded intriguing although I confess I didn't fully understand what that was all about so I came in and started talking to Andy and a few of the other senior leaders and eventually to Jeff and I would have to say that even by the time I took the job I thought I mostly understand what they're talking about and it sounds like a good idea and I'm in but I also was like well you know we'll just have to see how it goes and and you know Amazon's a big big place and so I think we got a lot of a lot of intent to succeed here and that's the thing that impressed me was Amazon really had the desire and the intent and the belief that this could be a really good business. AWS comes out of stealth mode and is the first to market with a cloud infrastructure service in 2006. How important was that first start and and do you think AWS still has an advantage today because of that? I think the the time to market advantage that we had which was probably honestly five to seven years had started before other companies really started to take this seriously was in a norm frankly it was just one of the biggest things that happened to us in the early years because at the beginning a lot of people didn't get it I would get asked a lot in 2006 so what does this have to do with selling books and I mean I didn't have to slide with kind of a pile of books on it and a question mark next to it and the answer was it has nothing to do with selling books but the technology which enables us to sell books being global being at a massive scale being secure being low cost being a highly performant all that technology has everything to do with offering these types of services externally. Now AWS isn't a scrappy startup anymore and you do have big rivals even though AWS is still the leader Microsoft and Google are big rivals how do you make sure that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3000,2022-10-15 03:07:54
14775," You're gonna get me in trouble, aren't you? Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! You worked 10 feet away from Andy Jassy in the early days. Tell us something about the Amazon CEO that no one knows but you. Ha, ha, ha! You're gonna get me in trouble, aren't you? I grew up in Seattle and Andy coming from New York has this fascination I don't understand with New York sports teams. So I've had to endure that for a lot of years. New Yorkers, yeah. So what are you gonna do? I think come to adopt some of the Seattle teams, particularly the New Hockey team, the Kraken here. As he should. As he should exactly. So how do you expect Andy will be different from Jeff? Or how has Andy already been different from Jeff? Well, I think we're all different as leaders. I think it's all important that we all bring our own stamp to it and operate within ourselves. I don't think I would be a very good Andy. I don't want to presume but I would assume that Andy wouldn't be a great Jeff because Jeff's Jeff, Andy's Andy, and I'm me. So I think that Andy was certainly bringing a great depth of experience from AWS, which is one important part of the business and we'll having operated that business for so long. And I expect that will also give him an opportunity, although he was involved in other parts of Amazon certainly for a number of years. We'll be able to bring a fresh perspective to the whole company just as I hope to bring to AWS. And I think that fresh perspective is often helpful. I think just the mere act of change is useful for the business, for customers, for employees, and just to shake things up a little bit. So I think just a fresh perspective. How will you be different from Andy? I think that the world around us is changing so much that we're going to have to be different. It doesn't matter what we did yesterday. Right after I joined, we actually added two new leadership principles, which is very exciting. One's around striving to be Earth's best employer, and the second around focusing on the fact that success and scale bring broad responsibility. And those are things about which I personally am very passionate. And so I really personally look forward to digging in and helping the company to figure out what are those things that we have to figure out? Where can we innovate to be Earth's best employer? And then also to figure out externally, what can we do to really be great citizens of our local communities, to be great citizens of our national communities, and to be great citizens of the global community? And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I'm trying to put a good amount of energy and time and focus.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3001,2022-10-15 03:16:05
14776," of the global community. And I care a lot about those things, as a lot of other people do here, but I plan to put a good amount of energy and time and focus and hopefully help Amazon innovate in all of those areas. How closely do you work with Andy Day-to-Day? Does he regularly weigh in on AWS decisions or not? Well, he's got a pretty broad scope of things to worry about now, so he's got a pretty intense day job, I believe. So he's really focused across the company as you would expect him to be. But that being said, obviously, AWS remains an important part of Amazon. And so we touch base regularly, be it in person or via email, just on the most important things going on in the business. Does Jeff ever weigh in on AWS decisions? Yes, I mean, really from the beginning, Jeff was involved at the very, very beginning at some of the most fundamental decisions. How do you price EC2? What do you name S3? What does the detail page look like? Obviously, over time, we, the business grew, but this, Jeff was always available when we needed him. And I certainly anticipate that'll be the same going forward. So is he still available now? And what do you understand that Jeff's priorities are? Sure. Well, I'll let Jeff speak to his own priorities, but certainly Jeff has been available when, for example, we've been doing our annual planning cycle as many companies have. And it's been great to have Jeff, you know, weigh in on really where we're heading for the next year and beyond and to just make sure it's easy to get focused on the details of the business. And it's great to have multiple people who can help you pick your eyes up a little bit. Now, you joined AWS in the middle of a pandemic. You came back to AWS in the middle of a pandemic. That's hopefully moving into the rear view mirror. Moderna is one of AWS's biggest customers. If it weren't for the cloud, if it weren't for AWS, what do we have had a vaccine as quickly as we did? I've got to tell you, I'm Iuseb, it's been an absolute privilege for us to work with Moderna because what they're doing, obviously, is literally life-saving. And they've been so innovative and so creative. So Moderna took a drug development process to get to a vaccine candidate. That process would typically have taken them 20 months. And doing that on AWS in conjunction with all the innovation on their side reduced that 20 months to 42 days. 42 days to get the vaccine candidate, the mRNA vaccine candidate for COVID-19. And those really running multiple parts of Moderna on AWS. So if you look at the drug design part, they had their drug design studio running on AWS all the way to manufacturing with the new digitized manufacturing that they call their digital manufacturing platform. So it's really end to end and the ability to use massive amounts of resources and to pick the exact type of service and capability for each part of the job and to really bring the full set of resources to bear. In addition to not having to focus on the IT and the infrastructure and the technology and rather letting Moderna focus on the all important job of drug discovery. So working in partnership, it was just magnificent to see what they accomplished. Since you joined AWS, a number of longtime AWS leaders have moved on to Microsoft, to Stripe, to Tableau, does that concern you? Well, actually retention has been very good. If you mentioned the senior leaders, if you look at the VP plus ranks, the VP and above ranks at Amazon, the average tenure is over a decade, over 10 years. So that's actually very, very strong retention. So of course, you're always going to have some level of people coming and people going. And at the end of the day, that's actually healthy for the business. You want new perspectives to come in. Of course, in the right proportion. Amazon has opened an investigation after 550 employees supported a petition, claiming a culture of discrimination, harassment, bullying and bias. What's the status of this? Well, we are incredibly focused. And I personally believe it's incredibly important to really have a very diverse, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3002,2022-10-15 03:21:09
14777," A very diverse, you know, inclusive and equitable environment. And we're going to make sure that whatever it takes that we've got that. So we believe that we're really doing a lot of things to deliver on that. And we've got a lot of innovative efforts around bringing in a diverse workforce, which we have to have both because we're going to serve our customers best, they're diverse, we have to match that diversity. And also I just believe that it's our responsibility and it's the right thing to do. Any time there is any possibility that things are not, something is not gone the way we wanted to. We're going to investigate it thoroughly. That's what we're doing in the middle of doing in this case. And we'll make sure that we're operating in a way that's consistent with our values. And that's always the only goal. If you could rewind to the early 2000s, the earliest days of AWS. Is there anything you would have done differently to build an inclusive culture to start with a more inclusive culture, to make sure that it didn't become a, you know, a boys club? Well, I don't think that's what we have. I think that we do have a really fun, exciting innovation led and inclusive culture. And that being said, these are hard problems. I think we've done a lot, but we are nowhere close to where we need to be. We're going to be restless and dissatisfied with our progress on DE and I just as we are with every other part of our business. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sense. The metaverse is real. AWS has the biggest trove of sensitive corporate data in the world. I'm curious how you think about the balance between data and privacy and, you know, freedom and civil liberties in the modern era. I mean, there are governments. There are nation states around the world that want that information. Hackers and criminals want that information. Well, we are very clear to start with that. Our first job is security. We often say security is job zero. It was on the first page of our operating plan pretty much every year. Every year that I can remember. But what about when governments request that information? So, subpoena that information. Sure. Well, we are very clear that our customers data is their data. So the data belongs to our customers. And not everybody operates that way. We are not going to look at customers data. We are not going to compete against our customers using their data. Their data is their data. And furthermore, we have all sorts of architectural best practices that our customers should be and are using for any sensitive data. And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3003,2022-10-15 03:26:37
14778," And so a lot of that really relies around encryption. And so we build a lot of different encryption capabilities so that any sensitive data, which could leak for any reason, be it to a government, be it to a hacker, be it to anyone else, any form of security breach, that it's encrypted and useless to anybody else. Given the broad array of encryption solutions that we provide, it's actually very doable and powerful for our customers to safeguard their data that way. Mark Zuckerberg is making a big bet on the metaverse. Is AWS going to have a role in the metaverse? I think AWS already has a big role in the metaverse. So I think the cloud enables the metaverse. So if you think about all of the compute capacity, all of the storage, all of the machine learning, which is required to create, compelling and delightful end user experiences in the metaverse, a lot of that is already today running on AWS. So if you take Epic Games, for example, Epic Runs Fortnite, massively popular game, 350 million users worldwide, and Epic Runs almost everything on AWS from the backend, servers to the analytics and everything in between. So I think that's a great example of the metaverse at work and all that's happening today on AWS. And we anticipate that's only going to grow really rapidly in the future. How big do you think it's going to be? Such an interesting sentence. The metaverse is real. And yet it's virtual at the same time. I think that if we continue to do what we've always done, which is to provide a technology platform that allows organizations to transform, then these gaming and entertainment and social media and other companies will be able to do what they do best. Which is to focus on innovating on behalf of their end users. And I think that the metaverse in many other areas will be rich with inventions. So this next conversation will happen in the spheres in the metaverse. That's where we'll next meet. That could be, I'll meet you in the metaverse. All right, see you there. Now, I know that climate change and stopping climate change and your data center footprint is a big passion of yours. How fast will Amazon's data centers get to carbon neutral? Amazon is already the largest purchaser of renewable energy in the world. And we intend to be 100% renewable energy by the year 2025. We originally said 2030. We actually accelerated that by five years to 2025. And that's part of our broad climate pledge that Amazon created. And to which we've now gotten 200 other organizations to sign on to. And the climate pledge is to be a net zero carbon by 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Accord target. So we know how to do some of that. Other part are going to require invention, but we really look forward to it. And I think it's one of the most important things we can do for our generation. Amazon counts some of the biggest oil and gas producers as its customers. Isn't that a contradiction? Should you be kicking them off your platforms? Those customers are trying to get to sustainable business models, which rely on new energy sources. And so many of those customers are figuring out how do they get to wind, how do they get to solar, how do they get into batteries, all new business models relying on renewable energy. And I think rather than abandoning them and having them maybe dig in more, on fossil fuels, if we can enable them to move faster, to be more innovative, and to be more agile in figuring out new business models, new technical solutions, experimenting, failing fast, and moving on to the next idea, then the whole world will get to the renewable energy solutions that we need. At this year's re-invent conference, it'll be the first time that Andy Chessie is not giving the keynote. You will be, give us a preview. What can we expect to hear? We're going to have a lot of really exciting announcements. So I think across our service portfolio, you'll see that. We have a lot of exciting partner announcements. The partner ecosystem still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing. And we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to be able to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3004,2022-10-15 03:29:35
14779," The system still remains to this day so important to what AWS is doing and we have some great announcements lined up for that. And then I think people are going to want to see that we're making it easier and easier for them to consume the cloud and to work with AWS. And so we're going to continue to, in addition to building more powerful basic capabilities, we're going to continue to make it easier and easier in a variety of ways to interact with AWS.

So here we are on the elephants. Since this very first YouTube video was uploaded 16 years ago, the world's most popular video network has exploded to more than 2 billion users in the farthest corners of the planet, now raking in billions of dollars every year. It's evolved a long way from cat videos to become a one click journey to the center of the zeitgeist pop culture and kid culture. Amplifying some of the brightest and sometimes darkest traits in all of us while YouTube has elevated a generation of creators and educated and entertained generations of viewers, it's fought misinformation, terrorism, racism and violence many clicks along the way. Lately, YouTube's biggest battles are focused on eliminating COVID and vaccine misinformation and keeping the platform safe for kids and teens. On this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, we rewind to talk about where YouTube has been and fast forward to where it's going next with one of the longest tenured employees and women at Google, the CEO of YouTube Susan Wajitski. It's been five years since we last talked on camera and we have a new president. We are weathering a pandemic. The most watch video on YouTube is baby shark baby shark. So a lot's changed since 2016. How do you feel about YouTube 2021 versus 2016? I feel good about it. It's definitely been a while and in technology things move so quickly so a lot of things have changed since 2016. Overall, I've been really pleased that we've continued.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3005,2022-10-15 03:33:53

I'm with invested a lot in responsibility. And that's been a really big focus for us. And with weather through a pandemic and a lot of hard challenges, but overall I'm feeling really good. You've been at Google for 20 plus years going all the way back to Larry and Sergey in the garage. You've been the CEO of YouTube for seven plus years. How has your job changed in that time? Since I joined being the CEO of YouTube, I would say one of the biggest things that has changed certainly has just been maybe the recognition of the importance of digital video. So when I first joined, actually a lot of people would say, oh, like, why did you join? I was running ads beforehand and that's been the main way Google generates revenue. And so a lot of people said, like, why did you leave that and go to YouTube? But I always believed in digital video and I believe that now we see that the world also believes we've seen a lot of adoption of digital video and the benefits that that can have. You've championed this diversification strategy at YouTube since you started. What's working and what's not working? Well, our main way of generating revenue is from advertising. But we also have really grown our subscription revenue and that has been really, really important from many different reasons. So that has enabled our users to have an experience where they can have music, YouTube music and premium. We just announced the 50 million subscribers that we were really excited about. But we also see other ways that our creators generate revenue. So our creators, for example, generate revenue with channel subscriptions. They may sell merchandise. We also have things like digital goods, so like super chat, super thanks. And so we've basically diversified the number of ways that our ecosystem is generating revenue. The original tagline for YouTube was broadcast yourself and that concept has exploded. You have ordinary people in the spotlight. When they grow up, they want to be an influencer. They want to be a YouTube star or a YouTube creator. What do you see as the future of the creator economy? I see a lot of possibility with the creator economy and because I see that many people have a lot of interest and they have a lot to offer. And beforehand, they went up and able to have shared that with the world. And so there's so many people depending upon what their talent or their interest is, whether it's a sport or cooking or gaming or hairstyles that people have come out and really been able to share that and create a lot of jobs. So we actually see, like our, we actually saw a 35% increase in the number of creators that are generating six-figure income out of YouTube and in the last year. And so that's just an example of like how the creator economy is continuing to grow. And for years, YouTube was the only company that actually paid creators. But now a lot of companies are paying creators. Facebook, Instagram, Snap, TikTok. How do you see that competition playing out? Who wins? Well, it is a competitive landscape. And in general, competition's good. It makes everyone work harder and that's good. I mean, we look at creators and we say they're going to come to us if we do the best job. And creators come to us looking basically for fame and fortune. Like how can I, I have a skill or I have a talent, something I want to share with the world. And YouTube can help that be known, can help them provide that fame, but also we can generate revenue for them. And so as long as we're doing a good job of that, creators are going to come to us. If we start to fail, then they're going to leave us and they're going to go to another platform. And so we just need to work really hard to make sure that we deliver that for our creators. A year ago during the Black Lives Matter protest, YouTube made big commitments to Black creators in particular. What's been the progress there? And how do you see the potential for YouTube to be used as a tool for social justice? Well, so we've made an announcement that we were going to do a $100 million Black Voices fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3006,2022-10-15 03:38:37
14781," dollar Black Voices Fund. And so we're continuing to develop content there. But one of the other thing, and I think there'll be, there's been a lot of great content that's come out and we'll certainly see more. But you know, because YouTube doesn't have any gatekeepers, like you can just post and become a creator, you know, we have seen a lot of people of different backgrounds and under represented backgrounds become creators and have audiences. We never really measured it beforehand because we didn't have a way. And so one of the things that we've done is we've enabled creators to now tell us what backgrounds they they affiliate with so we can have a better understanding of how they're doing on our platform. Let's talk about YouTube shorts. It seems to be a top priority. Yeah, we all know that TikTok is on the rise. How important are YouTube shorts to the platform, to the company? So YouTube shorts, it's very important. We see that creators and users want to watch all types of content, long form, short form. It turns out that the first video that was actually ever uploaded to YouTube, me at the zoo, was an 18 second video. So it was a short form video. And we have lots of short form videos and we've had it way before TikTok did. But what we have really been leaning into more is just enabling those to be found. And then a lot of the creation tools. And so bringing a lot more mobile creation is really important for us going forward. Did you notice that viewing time was being lost to TikTok? Did you see that trend? And do you see TikTok as a sort of existential threat? I mean, we definitely see many competitors in this space. What we're just focused on are like our own metrics like do we see our users engaging? Where's our opportunity? We're always looking around and seeing what our competitors are doing. And if they're doing something that we think would be good for our users and our creators, we're also going to look at how we can improve our own economy, creator economy, and what's good for our users. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough. One of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to get their messages across. Today's your big day. Are you excited? Mama is tired. They speed up work. You have to feed your creativity. So this treehouse, you guys ready for the movie? See what we can do. At this point, YouTube has become a hub for discovery, for information, for, you know, it satisfies our curiosities, right? That comes with a lot of inspiration, but also with misinformation. When it comes to vaccines, vaccine hesitancy, videos that cause a public health risk, where do you want to see YouTube do better? We've taken responsibility very seriously. It's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3007,2022-10-15 03:42:40
14782," Very seriously, it's been one of my top priorities. So first of all, we want to make sure that if there's information that violates our policies, we came up with 10 different policies around COVID. Then if that's a violation of policies, then that's something that we'll remove. We removed over a million videos associated with COVID, but we also want to make sure that we're raising up information that we think would be that come from trusted and authoritative sources. And we've really been able to do that. I think a lot of people, you know, we talk about vaccine hesitancy and they blame social media. They say YouTube's not doing enough, you know, how do you respond to that? Yeah, I mean, I think, first of all, we're always learning. I just, just to be fair, like we're always thinking about how can we do better? We're looking at the feedback and working with public health experts across the board. And, you know, I think one of the big things for us is to continue to work with public health experts to understand, you know, what are the ways that we can partner with them to get their messages across. And I really believe that that is something that's really changed is the evolution of bringing creators, musicians, experts talking about public health. We never would have seen that before in the pandemic. How much do you internalize the criticism of YouTube's content? Do you take it personally? And how does that influence the decisions that you make as CEO? I want to be doing the right thing. And I care about that. I care about the legacy that we leave. I care about the world that we leave to our children. I care about how media is consumed by the next generation and by everyone today. And so I really have put a lot of time and effort to make sure that we are acting responsibly. And there's always a balance between the free speech and the, right, but being responsible and taking down content that we think could lead to some kind of real-world harm. And so I mean, sure, I think whenever you're in a position like that, there's going to be a lot of criticism. But our goal is just to continue to talk to experts and evolve. And how do you make decisions in those tough moments where it's a tough call? Like how much of it is making a decision or leading by consensus and how much does it come down to you? The goal is that when we have tough decisions, they're not, we're not, they are like improvising in some way. Like we've made a concrete set of decisions beforehand. And then we're looking and saying, is this something that meets our standards? Is it a violation or not a violation? And if it seems like there's some set of issues with the content that we have on the platform, we're going to go back to experts and then reevaluate. It should be making changes to our policies. YouTube helped keep a generation of children connected, educated, entertained, distracted, through the pandemic. What have you learned from that experience? And what do you see as the potential future of YouTube as a tool for learning, as a tool in schools? When I meet people and they find out on the CEO of YouTube, almost always, they tell me about something they learned on YouTube or someone that they're something their family member learn. So I see that as being a very significant part of YouTube. And during the pandemic, we certainly saw that a lot more education went online, and we had all the homeschooling. We had people who had to also just learn a lot of skills that they hadn't learned beforehand. But probably the biggest thing that we also learned was just, and that I really saw was the need for us to continue to work with educational institutions. And the need for us to be able to integrate with some of the learning tools that the kids are all using because they are using YouTube. And there's a lot more that we can do to really help educators have YouTube be a key part of the curriculum. My kids are on YouTube a lot, and sometimes more than I want them to be. And sometimes it's super productive, and they're learning something cool. And sometimes it's not productive at all. How are you innovating to make the time that kids spend on YouTube more valuable? And of course, safe. It's very important to me as a parent to make sure that we're giving parents options about how what they want their kids to see. And that's one of the reasons that pretty much as soon as I got to YouTube, we started working on YouTube kids, which is a separate app, which is important for kids in terms of how we can control the quality. And we can give parents a lot more control about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And you know, there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens with...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3008,2022-10-15 03:47:18
14783," about what kind of content is appropriate for them and their family. And, you know, there are many other things like we actually just came out with a supervised experience for tweens because tweens was one of the age groups that was actually hardest. They usually don't want to be on the kids app, but they're not 13 to be on the on the main app. And so the supervised experience is something that we recently came out with. The Wall Street Journal has been doing some in-depth reporting on Facebook. The report is that Facebook knew that Instagram was toxic for teen girls and didn't do anything about it. Does YouTube look at the impact it has on teen users? The influence it might have on someone's body image or self-esteem? First of all, I think it's a very important topic. And we do have a panel of experts that we work with to be able to help us understand what are the different ways that our product could be used or what are... How do we face some of these challenging issues to make sure that we're getting the best advice? And we certainly do see for a lot of really tough issues that YouTube can be a really valuable resource. So body positivity, mental health, we see a lot of creators actually talk about mental health. And that for a lot of kids, it's really... it like destigmatizes and enables people to talk about what they're doing. And it enables people to talk about what's happening and what's going on with them. The potential long-term impacts of YouTube on teens and on children, whether it is toxic or whether it's addictive. Is that something that you wonder about? Is that something that you struggle with not just as a CEO but as a mom? We certainly want to make sure that we are doing what we can to be responsible with kids and in every way possible. And that's one of the reasons that we actually have worked hard to give parents as many options as possible for them to decide what is important for them and their family. Whether that's like limiting screen time, like limiting what is the content they actually have access to. I mean, even letting parents just say, these are like the 10 videos. My kid can only see these 10 videos. And so that is really important for us to give the tools back to parents for them to decide what is best for them and their family. Are you concerned about looming regulation? There may be regulation that is well-intended but actually then has a really negative impact. But if we select on twist an? I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack on the United States Capitol. Like all Americans, I am outraged by the violence, lawlessness, and mayhem. How much did President Trump test YouTube and how much did it test you as a leader? The integrity is something that we see incredibly, incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3009,2022-10-15 03:52:12
14784," It's something that we see incredibly, it's incredibly important, and we've leaned into in every way we possibly can. We treat all public figures and all public leaders, the same as we treat any individual. And so, meaning that everybody is held to the same standards. And so, we definitely held President Trump as we would hold all other presidents and all other elected officials to the same standards that we hold our creators and anyone else on YouTube. But was that difficult for you as the CEO of the company? I mean, that's kind of, that's like a big responsibility. I mean, yeah, it is difficult, but it is very important, and we also are global. So, we're dealing with leaders from all over the world. And there were a number of leaders that, and there continue to be a number of leaders that, you know, that poster, that there's content that may be a violation of our policies. But we do hold a consistent standard across everything that we do. YouTube was the last platform to ban Trump. And you have said, his channel will be reinstated when an elevated risk of violence has subsided. How and when specifically will you make that decision? Well, we'll make that decision based on a number of different factors, whether that is like events in the news, signals we're seeing from the, from the government. And we'll certainly continue to evaluate that based on a large number of signals that we see. And will he ultimately be reinstated? I mean, we've stated that we will reinstate him when we believe that there is no risk to public safety or no public danger. Google just removed a voting app for Russian opposition leader Alexi Navalny. The Russian government seems to be stepping up requests to take down content. You've talked in the past about your family history, your grandparents living behind the iron curtain, being concerned about censorship back then. And Russia is a huge YouTube audience. Yeah. How concerned are you about Russian government overreach? One of the things that we're is important to us at YouTube is the fact that we do enable so many voices and that we do enable people to express themselves and really celebrate the freedom of speech. And we certainly, yeah, that's, that's a core value of ours. But when we work with governments, there are many things that we have to take in consideration, like whether it's like local laws or what's happening on the ground. And so there's always going to be multiple considerations that we're going to have to take into consideration. Navalny said that YouTube deleted a video, one of his videos. Was that at the request of the Russian government? We certainly get requests from governments. And, and we look and consider what's, you know, why are we getting the request? What's actually happening on the ground? And based on a whole bunch of different factors, we make a decision. So we don't always, like those are not always requests that make sense for us to honor, but in certain cases, you know, we will honor them in that country. The Biden administration seems to be targeting big tech. We've seen Mark Zuckerberg. We've seen Jack Dorsey now test a five before Congress multiple times. And I've heard it said that YouTube is getting a pass. Do you think you should be up there testifying? Well, I think we do go a lot of scrutiny. I feel like there's a lot of scrutiny. And because YouTube is part of Google, Sundar has testified a number of different times and answered many different questions on YouTube. So I do believe there's a certain amount of scrutiny. And, you know, if I were ever asked to testify, it certainly would go and testify as well. You're one of the most senior women at Google. It's not the most senior woman at Google. Google has faced a lot of scrutiny for how it treats women in recent years. How much progress do you think Google has made in hiring and promoting women across the company? And how much progress do you think still needs to be made? I see a really big effort across technology as a whole to be able to be more inclusive. And I think that is really positive. I've been a big supporter of it. It's the very beginning. And I mean, I think at Google, there are many efforts and there's a lot of work that has been done. And I'm sure there's a lot more for us to continue to do. And if you just look at the stats, you can see they're not enough women. We need more women in technology. And I think we have made a lot of progress. But it still has.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3010,2022-10-15 03:56:03
14785," More for us to continue to do and if you just look at the stats you can see they're not enough women we need more women in technology and I think we have made a lot of progress but it's still hard it's hard to be it's harder to be a woman in technology it's harder to be a minority of any kind and so I think there's still a lot of work for us to do. When we last spoke five years ago you know I asked you about being a mom you have five kids and you said something that really stuck with me you said being a mom makes me a better leader. I prioritize better I see something growing fast and I run towards that if something's growing closely I'm like I don't have time for that. How has that management strategy played out for you? I think it's played out really well. I mean, rare sensation is everything when you look at it because we have a lot of opportunity there's a lot of moving pieces a very dynamic environment so if you can prioritize and say these are like the most important things to do then you're going to get there faster. Larian, started to have no left. How long do you plan to keep running YouTube? How long do you plan to stay at Google? As long as I have a mission that I believe in and that and things that I'm excited about getting done. So I have a lot of ways that I see that YouTube can continue to grow. I have a lot of products and ideas and things that aren't yet released and things that we don't aren't yet doing and I'm excited about getting those done. So I think if there comes a time where I no longer have a list of projects or I feel like I don't have that much more to add then it'll be probably time to do something else. Would you throw your hat into the ring to be Alphabet's next CEO or if the board asked you would you step up and do that? Well, I think Sender is doing a great job. I'm very pleased. I think he's doing I mean it's a very challenging job. There's a lot of different constituents and a lot of product a lot of different issues and I mean I'll just say I'll always do whatever would be wherever I could be most helpful to the company. Do you still talk much to Larry and Sergey? I do still see them socially though, not not work wise. Do you ever talk about work? I mean sometimes it would be casually but our business is very complex right now and there's a lot of things that are happening and so it's hard for I mean people may have different opinions but to really engage it's a long conversation. What do you want your legacy to be? I am proud of the way that we've been able to enable people to have a channel to have an audience like I just met with a number of three three creators and like YouTube really was able to let them shine and create audiences in a business and employ people that otherwise never would have happened and so that's certainly one continuing to grow that. I'd say second it's been really important to me to to see a lot more women in technology that has been just a personal goal of mine is to like be a role model and try to support women and I feel very fortunate to be have gotten to where I have and I know it was due to like many different factors and I want to support the next generation of women and make see technology as like an open place where anyone can come and be successful and then probably lastly continue to grow what we're doing with education.

Our name, image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will be not allowed to make money off of their name, image and likeness. Today is the last day that amateurism has at least a shadow meaning in our culture. The most seismic change in college sports happened in 2021 and its aftershocks are still ricocheting across the landscape. Non-pro athletes getting paid for use of their name, image and likeness until last year banned by the NCAA is now allowed and it's changing the face of sports and business radically. According to OpenEndors, brands spent almost a billion dollars in the first year of the new rules and that number is only going to grow. With some of the biggest winners, they may surprise you.

14787," Top female athletes are cashing in and women's basketball players are standing center stage. Your heels you want your heels to go down. You took a pre-ride coup. And I always really is pretty surreal. I don't think I really wrap my head around the concept that I am making money just doing the thing that I love. Starting her sophomore year, Aisy Fudds already signed deals with Chipotle, American Eagle and others, earning tens of thousands of dollars leveraging her on-court prowess and off-court social media following. She's also getting massive investment from the pro game as well, becoming one of the first athletes to sign with Steph Curry's SC30 Inc. The two even designed to shoot together. One Steph Curry would wear during his 2021 NBA Finals MVP performance. It's an investment directly into a future player, but also the future of women's basketball. And especially for the women's game, NIL deals may not only benefit the students, but the pro game as well. I'm gonna call Carly knows everything. Hey, hi Carly. I have my TV mounted on the wall in my room, and I'm wondering if I'm moving back into the same room. Can I just take the TV off and leave the mouse? Kind of all the little things that I said I have too much of. Um, AZFUD can almost trick you into thinking she's just a regular college student. You can't judge me by what you see here today. We just finished our summer session, so I'm about to move out. I got to completely move out to remove in the exact same apartment. Sorry to stress me out. I gotta carry this back. Who's gonna help you move all the big stuff now? Oh, well, you see, I leave tomorrow, so I will be probably playing at all lighter. But not if my mom is watching this, I will be going to sleep early and getting my rest. Don't let a messy dorm room and procrastination fool you, though. It's very clear, very quick, that there is nothing ordinary about her. FUD was the class of 2021's number one consensus recruit while she was playing for Saint John's College High School out of DC. Now she's playing for one of the most storied and winning programs in any sport in history, the University of Connecticut Huskies. The national championship goes to Connecticut for the fourth year in a row. As the dynasty fulfills its destiny. Winners of 11 national championships, producers of Olympians, and multiple WNBA MVP's. But AZ has something that the trailblazing women of Yukon's past never had. The opportunity to not only play basketball, but get paid for it. I remember just learning that you could profit off of your name and brand. And like, I could profit off of AZ, the basketball player, not just AZ, the person. Which I didn't really understand why you couldn't, because at least for me, like, AZ, the basketball player is also AZ, the person, like, basketball is such a huge role. And my life that I didn't understand why I wouldn't be able to profit from it. It's important to understand exactly what made this all possible. In 2021, after decades of debate, lawsuits, and legislation, the NCAA prompted by a unanimous ruling by the Supreme Court, finally relented on one of its longest standing strictures. That athletes could not in any way be compensated beyond scholarships and small stipends from their schools. It would only take a few months before AZ, a freshman at the time, would sign her first major deal with Chipotle. Before the freshman even got to play a game for the Huskies, she aches her first NIL deal as a college athlete ambassador for the magnificent Mexican restaurant chain. You are on the leading edge of something that feels, for those of us who've been looking at sports for a long time, like a very meaningful moment in sports. Like, the economics are changing the role of sports in society is changing. We see that from the outside. You're inside it. Yeah, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell like how important it is, but at the same time, like this is all I know and come.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3013,2022-10-15 04:08:50
14788," See that from the outside, you're inside it. Yeah, does it feel momentous to you? You can tell how important it is, but at the same time, this is all I know in college basals, NIL. So I'm still trying to find my way in it, find my groove and stuff. But I know how important it is, and the people before me paved the way and set that path for me to be able to do this and how important it is for me to be able to take advantage of this and be able to continue this on for the athletes to come. While colleges and universities still can't directly compensate their athletes, those athletes can legally be paid by third parties who want to use their name, image and likeness, or NIL. AZ, advised closely by a team led by her parents and her agents, has created a portfolio anchored by relationships with Chipotle, American Eagle, sports drink, bio-steel, and SC-30. Brands, she already admired as a successful athlete, and American teenager. I've been lucky that the deals that I've been approached with have been things that have been really good and things that have, like, American Eagles, one of my favorite brands. I always wear their jeans. So it's one of the easiest transitions type things. Bio-steel was something that I hadn't really tried before, and once I did, I really liked it. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ On the basketball side, it's impossible to be on Yukon's campus and not feel the weight of history, especially when you see where the team works out. Officially called the Worth Family Yukon Basketball Champion Center, it's a 78,200 square foot complex that costs $40 million. It's most striking feature. It's split right down the middle between men's and women's basketball. Seemingly identical when you walk in, except while the men's team boasts four national championships, the women's side has more than double that. And that actually understates their dominance. The team has gone undefeated in six seasons, and its players have been staples on the US Olympic team. Suburred and Diana Tarrassee are only the latest in the line of superstars that began in the early 1990s with Rebecca Lobo. The Huskies have featured 12 AP national players of the year, including Lobo, Maya Moore, Twice, Brianna Stewart, three times, and most recently, Paige Becker's will get to her in a minute. It is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you gotta know when and how and why to use that information.

What do you take from that personally? I think it can be seen for sure as like overwhelming kind of pressure to live up to the standards. But I use it kind of as motivation. This is our Yukon program like there's no need to compare ourselves to the past. Like we're not those players that we see on the wall. We're different players like I'm A.C. I'm not super. We need to forge our own path and our own story and the Yukon books. Those former Yukon stars helped to establish the Yukon team as a product to watch. Over the last decade, meteorites moved from Connecticut public television to S&Y and now include Fox Sports. With game coverage mixed with behind the scenes documentaries, Yukon has become one of the biggest platforms for women's basketball. The Yukon women's team is so well known that at the moment, it's arguably a better platform than most if not all of the professional women's teams or even the WNBA overall. Well, I don't think there's any greater female sports collegiate brand than Yukon women's basketball. It's on TV. You can follow those athletes in a way that if you compare it to the WNBA, you don't always get consistency of coverage, local or international markets. You're not always able to follow those athletes. It feels so nice to be back. This is Angela Regiro. She's a former hockey player and four-time Olympian. She now runs Sports Innovation Lab. That's a Boston-based company that uses data science to help teams and leagues understand their fans and figure out how to better engage them. The future of sports really is how do you optimize and drive revenue in these digital spaces, these digital communities? So collegiate athletes are going to really benefit from the change in the NIL ecosystem because they're authentically themselves. They're using these platforms already and they're being entertainers. I'm not sure how to work this. I think it's recording. Fans of women's sports and female athletes want more authenticity. These fans are dying for not just the game and the stats and the scores. They want to know what you're doing 24-7. They want to know what these female athletes think. What are they wearing? What are they dating? What do they care about? What are their causes? And that's going to build a wave of support when those athletes graduate that they'll hopefully bring to those WMBA teams. I think that this is really an incredible opportunity for me and all of women's basketball to be able to benefit and it's sad knowing that this is kind of our most profitable age. So I think that that's also a big and important part of being able to use NIL now before going pro. But dance videos and homemade tostinos ads can only take that mission so far. AZ knows that success on the court comes first and will allow everything else to follow. And while Yukon has had a storied history, their last championship was way back in 2016. Lucky for her, she's playing with not only just a good friend and dance partner, but the best college player in the country, Paige Becker's. Paige Bucket's Becker's is also one of the biggest college students when it comes to NIL deals, striking the first NCAA athlete deal with Gatorade, as well as partnerships with StockX and CashApp. And she has been estimated to potentially bring in a million dollars in NIL deals. We do a lot of team activities for some horse riding. Yes, this is my first one involving a live animal. During the last week of official summer workouts, AZ Paige and their teammates finished their last session and went over to Yukon's horse barn for some team bonding. Oh, I'm so happy. I have an extra large. Right, so when you're working with the horse, as you want to try to stay calm and relaxed, you're going to make him anxious. I'm sorry. The typical day in stores can pick it. So we don't we don't play basketball. Peasants. Fair well. It was a light moment.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3015,2022-10-15 04:17:36
14790," It's what we do when we don't play basketball. Peasants. So well. It was a light moment before everyone went off to hang with their families and get rested up for the season. A few weeks later, beckers would have announced that her 22-23 season was over before it even started. You conwomen's basketball junior guard, Paige Beckers, suffered a torn ACL in her left knee and will miss the 2022-23 season. It's an injury AZ knows all too well, having gone through her own ACL tear in 2019. While Paige's absence will test the team's depth and metal, what was on display in stores and apparent in conversations with AZ was that she and Beckers were intent on using their increasingly higher profiles, not just to benefit themselves, but their entire team. Bruh, Peasants. Now you didn't. She's so sweet. Oh, I'm so excited. In AZ's case, that means free to vote like. Thank you. Both AZ and Paige are conscious of the inequality that still exists in NIL. While the players in this room share the benefit of playing at Yukon, not all can or will get the deals AZ and Paige have already signed. Stop being so fuzzy first since I catered. People outside of your world of actually doing it speculate about the consequences and maybe some of the unintended consequences of NIL, you think, well, you know, the really prominent players like you were going to benefit and then other players are not. And so maybe there's some jealousy or envy or whatever. How do you make sure that it doesn't? We were very tight. We're a super close group. I mean, you've been to stores or not, there's not much else to do besides play basketball and hang out with each other. And I think it also is because that whatever deals we get, like, you share with each other. So I have a deal with Chipotle and my whole team whenever they want Chipotle, they let me know or American Eagle, they can get whatever they want. I think it goes both ways with whatever deals. Other people have that we're super open and always willing to share. I think I'm posting an answer around about this. This would be the last team meal for AZ before going on summer break. And when we next caught up with her, it would be about as far from a dorm room in stores that you could possibly get. AZ's out in LA this week to do a commercial shoot for a new underarmer shoot alongside both Steph and Seth Curry. Along with her is her family, including her former coaches and current business screens, her mom and dad. We make sure that one of us is at everything that she does just to just to give her that support. So I've been at a lot of them still blows my mind like, okay, well, you look really cute in that outfit, but it just doesn't like really. I don't know, sink in that that she's this public figure for lack of a better word. The partnership with Curry is both historic and important well beyond the deal itself. AZ was the first woman and the first college athlete to join the SC 30 brand and has developed a friendship with Curry. She fully concedes to initially being a bit starsore.

14791," are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalise the nation. Corporate Giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. It's kind of crazy. I mean, I try to keep my cool when I'm working out with him and like with Seth and Seth on set, but in my head I'm going a little bit crazy. Yeah. I first met him at Curry Camp right after my freshman year in high school. I got invited. I was one of the first two girls invited to camp. And then I was invited the next year as well. And then Curry ran me out to my agent, my group, and they let me know. And I was all for it. I'm working out with someone that I look up to and someone that inspires me. So getting to see firsthand, like him in action, like what he does behind the scenes. Like I get to challenge myself and compete a little bit with him. It's amazing. Shooting ads for unreleased at Paral isn't something cameras are welcome into. But Azee is also in LA for basketball, getting private workouts with Steph Curry's own trainer, Karl Bergstrom. Azee's also been a part of Curry Camps, including this past summer in San Francisco. She also helped design a shoe for the SC30 line. The Curry himself wore in an NBA finals game this past season. The 2022 Bill Russell NBA finals MVP award goes to Steph in Curry. Did you know that on average women have 30% less income for retirement? Yeah, I was one of the first brands where I kind of got to use my platform to speak out about title 9 and retirement equality. I think that's definitely something that I still want to continue to do. But that was big for me because I'm still trying to figure out what I stand for and what I support and things I want to be able to support. She's got to formulate her own understanding and opinion about life. We all have our own perspectives and that's what makes us all unique. We all have our own opinions and experiences. And I'm just proud that she found the level of comfort to be able to speak on something that she had no idea exists. I didn't know it existed. Retirement inequality women retired with 30% less income and retirement than men. I didn't know that was a thing. And I think from being a girl dad having her come along has awakened my senses to things that my wife is experiencing as a player. That I've seen firsthand being a girl's basketball coach. That the girls endure. It's been pretty tremendous honestly. And as a fellow girl dad, crazy involvement with an equality campaign was notable, but not surprising for AZ, who said she was drawn to his brand as much for his off the court persona as his championship pedigree. He is a very big family man. You can see that with his kids with his wife and I'm huge with my family. I do everything with them. They're with me here on this trip. So I think the family aspect was huge and just kind of his personality. He welcomed me in right away. Even when I was at camp, he made me feel part of that group and special. Just being here, I feel like I'm really part of this brand, part of this team, part of the Curry family. And I could be more grateful. I've never, of course, remembered as an NBA legend and rightly so, but it's a father of four daughters. Curry's also filled a void that AZ and others thought might be left empty after Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gigi died tragically in helicopter crash in 2020. Bryant had been arguably the biggest advocate in the world for the women's game. And without him, it was unclear who would carry that torch. That was kind of a big question when Kobe died. And I think that was going to step up and continue to help fight for women's basketball and help kind of raise the game. And I think Steph is doing a really good job of trying to invite a women to his camp. And little things like that that are helping to elevate the women's game. And this deal is incredible being not just the first NIL, the own college athlete, but also the first female scientist who has brand. I don't even really know what word to use to describe that feeling when I first signed it and being here now like it means so much. And this is connection to a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3017,2022-10-15 04:26:17
14792," and being here now, it means so much. Aze's connection to and reliance on her own family was unfolded by an LA. She'd come to the West Coast with her mom, dad, and two younger brothers, and her success as a burgeoning business provides some fun perks. I'm going to go on trips like this. I love just watching my parents reaction because they've been in the game. They've always played in college and they play professionally. So seeing their reaction to kind of where I am, it's just really funny. I mean, like my dad loves being around all these NBA players, and my mom loves seeing all these high level workouts. So seeing them happy, it's really fun. Bye. Aze's parents both played Division 1 basketball in college and coached her throughout her youth, which she credits made her the way she is. Even if sometimes it's not so easy to grow up with two coaches for parents. Part of the reason that I am the way I am is because they didn't really compliment much. So I always had something to work on. I was always working hard. I think they did a very good job. Obviously, my playing really bad. I would hear about that, but they did a really good job of separating mom and dad from coach. Yeah. I remember when I was younger, my dad would take me off to get ice cream and stuff after games. That was something when we started coaching. And we were very cognizant of not having that coach role carry over. I harbor things a little more. So sometimes they'd go get ice cream, and I'd be like, yeah, she's up. Why are you getting ice cream? I'm not getting ice cream. But then he really likes ice cream too. So when I started the coach, I definitely did not want to have that contentious relationship at all. And so the ice cream thing became a reminder to me, a treat to like, now I get to go back and be dead. Katie Fud played at NC State and then Georgetown in the late 1990s. As women's basketball was starting to gain a bit of traction, and the WNBA was in its form of years. She had to deal with inequalities that she never wanted her daughter to face. When it came time for AZ to pick a school, her mom had a big influence. When AZ was getting recruited, I felt very strongly about what is the culture. When I was at Georgetown, it was kind of it's a men's basketball program and not really much else. It's evolved since then. But in our practice time was limited on the court based on when the men practiced or, you know, it was just all based around the men. So there's a lot of schools that she was looking at where they had some storied men's programs. But how do the players interact? How does, you know, what's the culture on the campus? Like let's make sure that we're doing the right thing by both the men's and the women's program. AZ's parents were able to go from being her coaches to fans in the stands, but now have evolved into her advisory board on her branding deals. I think we spent the better part of the pandemic on seminars and YouTube and listening talk. I probably have a four year degree in and of itself on NIL just because we're just making sure we understood it as well as we could to help her, but also connecting with the right people. I think the fact that we have such a great relationship with her, she trusts us implicitly. Like we're not gonna put her in a situation that one she doesn't support the company or doesn't, you know, she wants authentic stuff and then we're not gonna put her in a situation that just isn't good for her. Yeah, I like these. As the new season starts, AZ's NIL deals existing and new will be in the background. Expectations are always high at Yukon and even more attention will be on her given Becker's injury. While new NIL opportunities grab headlines and attention, AZ has a clear focus on what's ahead. How do you raise your NIL game? How do you grow it in a way that's authentically easy? Well, I think now that I have my first year kind of under my belt, I have established my brand with all these other people, but I think I need to be able to kind of like establish my own brand more like the AZ brand and post about myself more as well, but I think just knowing that what your priorities are that my priorities right now are basketball and school because without good grades, we'll be able to play them without basketball. I wouldn't have these opportunities in these deals. I'm going to play them with you. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3018,2022-10-15 04:30:53
14793," You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You will get insight into limitless possibilities. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women. Less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, OK, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gao and Jennifer Fonstat, who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water rises and the mountains shake. All our will remain. We will never. We will never. No. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. July 2022 Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image, and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the college football hall of fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterback, it's favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Let's go. After hardly a full year of name, image, and likeness deals being the reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture, and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergr...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3019,2022-10-15 04:34:29
14794," image and likeness deals being the reality. He already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin not just UCLA quarterback but name image likeness superstar. I am siked for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. Chase isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback but back on campus in LA his nickname is president Chase and after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business sports and equality it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage I only wish I had if you want to buy stock and human being buy stock and chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even 10 times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campuses mostly for the athlete to run lighter but still regimented schedules. Attending classes working out a little bit of hanging out and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup albeit an impatient one. In the topsy-turvy past couple of seasons dotted with families games and COVID protocols he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin gonna throw to the end zone wide open again touchdown UCLA. Beating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full fledged comeback mode. For Chase UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better that so many of the people that UCLA pride itself upon being the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA greats like Arthur Ash Jackie Robinson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Cursey have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent ruin alum the basketball player Ed O'Bannon. Ed O'Bannon who was an ace-smith player of the year national champ UCLA sports legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing if we give him the roses he deserves we add Ed O'Bannon to that list of UCLA greats. O'Bannon who played at UCLA from 91 to 95 initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name image and likeness. He sued the NCAA in video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their likeness for game. In 2014 a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Terossi and LeBron James, California governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3020,2022-10-15 04:38:56
14795," On an episode of the shop surrounded by Obanan, Diana Tarrasi, and LeBron James, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent seemingly reluctantly. And IEL payments were officially allowed as of July 1, 2021. Today is the last day where name image and likeness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be, if you will, not allowed to make money off of their name image and likeness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIL thing is the wild, wild west. The NIL change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIL hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, which was fantastic. I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. And then Shell did hit and then boost my whole deal hit. And then you keep on building clear cover. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaire strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right, Jason. So here we are, World Headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pieces in there. And this is the best appliance since dog phone. If I already put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. The fridge filled with leftovers, a well-used PS4. And of course, the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. Bejon Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines that Muhammad Ali are proucely pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know, you're doing neither of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all due respect, not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. I mean, first I look at this is my own room. I got everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. And that's what it y'all is following the media. Yeah. And someone hears about a 5 million or 10 million dollar deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness, people are going to read this. Hey, I'd count two things. Like, how many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? And how much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghinis and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in saving it for a month.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3021,2022-10-15 04:43:47
14796," And I know some of those kids, but you know someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in saving it for a long pay, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media and they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great, but the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is the fact I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile, along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffel, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in burning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach and resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. The world is a global economy. The world is a global economy. The world is a global economy. Music It's a song by Julianne. I heard the opening. I just took that opening and I pitched it slow or I think I sped it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3022,2022-10-15 04:47:17
14797," I just took that opening and I pitched it slow, or I think I sped it. At his desk, when he's not making music, another side project, he's either networking with CEOs or investors he seeks out, or who seek him out, or negotiating new deals. Hey, Mallory. Hi, Chase. How are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You're no worries. This is an average NIL deal. A brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If the two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September, and the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Right. Are they video posts or are they, you know, picking captioning? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. So that's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point, after I do a Zoom or something like that, I get to chill out, go back to land down, if I was watching a movie or something, or, you know, go to YouTube, just start looking for more samples. This is pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with an athlete is more attractive to these brands now as well as a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the great iron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin, quarterback, class 19, Hado, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, from the back. He's there. I'd hope that if he can catch it. And I, he does touch it on the back. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons. But I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Joyner Cursey, and Abdul Jabbar. Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually never moderated. So this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting is terrible. The last day the conference Chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The United States is a very important organization for multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3023,2022-10-15 04:52:20
14798," I'm excited to be here. UniWorld Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson to help reach the black and brown communities. And they have big ambitions in NIL. For UniWorld Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media, advertising, community level engagement work. UWG launched a program called The NIL to help black student athletes partner with major brands. But to help them understand how to do that, they brought on chase to serve as a student athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 20, to the best way to have credibility is confidence. And the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for black student athletes in the NIL world. ROI. Return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIL deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. I think we're getting ready to stop boxes, trying to feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIL deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIL game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue, Jettin and rating sports for the ball festival, 88% of those athletes are black. When you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIL space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this help by any means. But statistically, by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. You're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students, some of them first gen high school diploma, some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIL. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly, have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIL athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIL industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIL space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3024,2022-10-15 04:56:31
14799," Time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went out through for 3,000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5. I mean, I could already say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But, you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. I'll be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for chase, his story is something he's not chied away from, but embraced when it comes to his NIL deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach taught me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs allowed him to capitalize financially from football. Even the last season, he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself changed Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't seem much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. Where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money and this is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect, but perhaps most of all when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the Bread Basket of Europe and taken with Russia the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade. They produce more than half of the world's sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throwing rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pendants interpolated 120%",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3025,2022-10-15 05:00:44
14800," Food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence. Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. A much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The new new bond market. China is a really big fault. Bitcoin ain't that long today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. I'm Bloomberg Reak. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg Crypto. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. If we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. In unconventional path, what I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became ski bump. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. And acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks, I met every tenant, I was counting the car traffic, I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk. If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely, where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Baron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. If my partner, I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. My father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that. Family. In fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 of them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3026,2022-10-15 05:05:23
14801," The idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why, then I'll let you do that and open account for you. So I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and I was called McDonald's company or from Cleveland and they were right by Asbury Park High School. So I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks and I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look, I got a report on this mom of county national bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asbury Park. And I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you just stay the same or win up an eighth and it was printed the 15 stocks in the Asbury Park press. And everybody says the same and then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1000 became $1700. I said, man, there's nothing today I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadeil. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Bulkertown, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were maybe doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fast nation with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock. Quos is that right? So it's amazing is is you know, I love the line. People go well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We're always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have never resolved. And the fax machine was revolutionary in the 1980s real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage. And what are the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No, never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer. And I...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3027,2022-10-15 05:10:00
14802," Mother and father, you said I'm going to go to law school, but you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days? I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. And so, in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, OK, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in New York. And so, he said, why don't you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so, that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So, I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski boat. But if your family say Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student, you're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I went skiing. I, my father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood Argon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood Argon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck 100 bucks a week, two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, find shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood Argon? Why did? And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paul O'Lent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their conservation lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did a scientific work at the Getty. And then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edrige, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple business classes at UCLA. And through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. And I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve. The Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while. Then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so he said, OK, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant. And my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break. And when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said, hi, I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work in a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in. And I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3028,2022-10-15 05:14:20
14803," We do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little, I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling at the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or yes. Not keeping, but people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, they just keep added. OK, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. My nights? Yeah. He's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Oh, put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right. I will, I will concede. I can see. Ah. You got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. OK. Mm. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Erdos, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management points out comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2,200 analysts starting today, and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3,600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very, in the September time period for their full-time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic manner. That's a 2 to 3 year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular eight-hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base-level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week. That cuts you down to about 2 and 1-1-half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting. And I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3029,2022-10-15 05:18:15
14804," talk meeting and I call it like a mini university and it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio and then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else and you're synthesizing all that information every morning and then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Don Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Erdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot. You know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers, but I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people and a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the two loops for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes, and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the great-grade shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business, and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local, because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about the value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years, and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010, and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up, and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing's going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate, plus you travel a lot, like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground, and we're local in those markets, and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. Thanks a lot.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3030,2022-10-15 05:23:26
14805," going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

Ask a question or visit searchgo to find answers now. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, views and analysis inside from and about politics power players. Weekdays, this is Bloomberg. This is really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see pressure on the U.N. We did see suppression of futures. That is now being reversed. One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Each top and venture firm has its own bar. So it has its own set of criteria for kind of whether it thinks that you should be done or not. And then the top tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. And it's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. Like after you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top and venture capital firm and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. And so this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top and firms is interested in it, that might be a very, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top and firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. In one of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. So Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while, you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers. Like the money is made on the aberrations. And so I would say you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point, things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That's that. I guess I would say we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not-macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods, but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods. Right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. You know, our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep going, keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through, and basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is on charter territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in art business is go for higher risk higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduced risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. Why?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3031,2022-10-15 05:27:09
14806," But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is I don't mind a 90% chance of probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with, it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now, what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are a million ways to make money. I think there are a million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality and that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor, like Clinder Perkins Chairman John Doer, has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtel-Schheim, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There have been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker. Or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. Well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well and so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geolphe will potentially arise. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? Well, we have a unique way that we go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong, it just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks may do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3032,2022-10-15 05:31:23
14807," I've tried to a little bit, I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long-term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level and that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again.

How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into? The crypto. The people are. I think that that I think was more last year. Do you think it's kind of a way of that past? No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with $1.5 billion to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why. Well, but with each cycle, there are.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3033,2022-10-15 05:35:48
14808," Those, we're all gonna make it hashtags. I'm seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of kind of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three hours. What's been your takeaways from all of that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara, that was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important. If you fast-tored and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time, and I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I felt like fascinating. There was a human aspect to it and people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime, but then really mistriing cases, being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV, going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I died at the largest prison gang in the world at the time. I was on motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology that we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time. It's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions. And five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3034,2022-10-15 05:40:30
14809," The Silk Road and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity, and it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, D.C. were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dieting and I ended up prosecuting those agents and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund in front of scratch? You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You can look at insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. That's very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? Crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC, take these things.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3035,2022-10-15 05:44:29
14810," to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company Coinbase OpenC take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for in Silicon Valley in the United East of Alexandria and Harowitz. What was your experience at A16Z-like? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Hearts. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think, really that speaks to the fact that, as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. You know, Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Hearts. It was running to another opportunity and you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport or it's like, you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7, it's global and it's hustle and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off and at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens to participate in the token ecosystem. Or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional venture capitalist, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia, you also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Does it how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles. But I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different. But I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators, who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on our early stage. But we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still keep us motivated without the needed available guidance and our 다�f I missed the touch.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3036,2022-10-15 05:49:43
14811," More of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's OK. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? It's just I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. Do you get VC FOMO and have you deploy that? Look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If there are amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan. If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're costating customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all given the downturn? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman, anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am. But if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. We're falling behind. We're falling behind. We're falling behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3037,2022-10-15 05:53:04
14812," When you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt. Before you change the world, Bloomberg. What about NFTs? NFTs, are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer, like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as the plumbing, if you think of the fiber-hubbic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? And are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see, we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes, too. And I think what I see is crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year over your growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just squash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register, just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, file the S1. And still, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC. And I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that it started with the ICO mania back in 2016, 2017. I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3038,2022-10-15 05:57:54
14813," out about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Wem 3? Mm-hmm. And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases. Especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find. Not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple still exists. I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, which would it be? Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcast, you're binging now. Yeah. Okay. I'm, yes, I am. Gosh, I'm binging on wheat crashed. Something that brings you simple joy. You know, one of the things that I love and I've missed being away from this summer is swimming. I just love, I find like some of my best thoughts come to me while I'm moving career philosophy. Yeah. Do a job where you know 50% of the job and where you're going to learn 50% of the job. Again, that goes back to no growth in the comfort zone, no comfort in the growth zone. Yeah, you Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order that's going to look like?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3039,2022-10-15 06:02:17
14814," We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on it pays them and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. You foresee two thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm François Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protect and the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know you should have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving our Earthshot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3040,2022-10-15 06:05:41
14815," Te Maffat. We must come together behind the innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place to must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, are the sky, father and papa to our Nuku, their earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now, it is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity, because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our share tomorrow. So we must choose and we act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3041,2022-10-15 06:10:06
14816," this transformed the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious, but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks, so Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. OK. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yeah. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. We did & found a sentimental conclusion to what the Welcome back to the best of the Earth Shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know when I last went through Europe people were the leaders were all saying hey give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said hey in five years you're going to be able to call him up. And they were like no we'd like it. Now. It's like here and now. Hey that how's your planning permission regime and all the you know planning for that future grid seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields it's about eight years now we have a pipeline of innovations.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3042,2022-10-15 06:14:35
14817," Fred, seeds typically between the time you start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles. Because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth Tempter's not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051. Take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is. And you can't just plan for OK, 2030, 2030s, where your maize production in central Africa is down 25%. By 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat-sensitive crop to sorghum. Now sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years. And then they are going to have to switch to sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafferable recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof-program money, is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece. It's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half-a-packed Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the problem. It's still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires, there are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energies funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new and there's some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third now and",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3043,2022-10-15 06:20:05
14818," the focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric, you know, so that's the field that we're further still long. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, and you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%, other people might say 70% 80%. You know, the amount you have to build, we're, you know, not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium, that's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. At a steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes should go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called the green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, OK, we want to get rid of that, which goes to our 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. It's over 200 billion foreign aid. Never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely. So there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1,800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. The market is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets.

Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit.

14819," And will award a peer alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists, and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future, and here's what they have to say. This is the Earthshot Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. And our Earthshot is, as Pari said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least. 30% of the ocean protected by 2030. And we know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There's going to be these protected areas are going to produce a spillover that will exceed the foreground catch. So we're going to have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces $10 in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security, and for climate, and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission, to in the next eight years. And that's where the Earthshot is pretty crazy. In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our Earthshot won't seem so improbable, the work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore. And not just places on Earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area, which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We have more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geomapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy. Which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500,000-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3045,2022-10-15 06:27:46
14820," Data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature And so one of the goals that we've said is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world I know we're going to hear from the mayor of a Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030 And so that's through data tools in sites whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030 Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place.

I'm fronstein lack well from New York and this is Bloomberg So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship? Then when you're trying to please investors. Where's the greater pressure? Oh, I think I think it's definitely trying to win a championship It's hard because a lot of like when you invest and you know this when you're investing Um, you can control a lot more things When you know in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's gonna make a shot you've got to get lucky And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous I wish I could do for one each year that would be great, but um, I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment That um, you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients, which I think is great I think winning a championship is It's a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you um, you know, we had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside It's 17,000 in uh stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside Um, and when we won like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal So, uh, Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3046,2022-10-15 06:31:53

It's hard to think of any athlete better known or more polarizing than Alex Rodriguez. He's doing it again! He's swatted the ball out of a rose head. See ya! He joins the 3000 hit club! A three time MVP, 14 time All-Star and World Series champion, he retired in 2016 as the highest paid player in MLB history. Fourth all time on the list of home runs. But his playing career isn't likely to be remembered by those statistics or by who he is or isn't dating. Record suspension tonight for baseball star Alex Rodriguez over his use of performance enhancing drugs. You say you did not do these PDs that they are choosing you to do it. You're correct, Mike. Okay. Best dude is unbelievable! A phony to the end! While it was the most painful time of my life, it may cost me the hall of fame. And that's on me. Nobody else. I think in a weird way I'm going to look back and say that's one of the best things that happened. Five years after his retirement, Alex Rodriguez, the CEO, is getting back into sports this time as an owner of a pro basketball team. And he wants to build more than just a franchise, but a legacy, maybe, with a dose of redemption. The mistakes made in baseball are done, and I can't go back and fix them. I want to keep a clean record of the father as a friend, as a business person. And because those mistakes, I think I have that opportunity and I'm having a time of my life doing it. A-Rod, Alex Rodriguez is buying the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx. The purchase price is expected to be in the range of $1.5 billion. You know, for me, I think making the transition from player to owner, something that's very exciting to me, I'm really excited to bring my experience both in business and in sports and in locker room, and do really, really exciting things and bring a war championship to the city. In April 2021, Alex Rodriguez joined one of the most exclusive clubs around, folks who own a pro sports team. And while his name and his fame made the headlines, it was his business empire that allowed him to actually close the deal. The easy to remember name, A-Rod Corp, it's grown into a diversified investor and operator, taking a cue from mega firms like Blackstone and KKR. A-Rod Corp has taken a real estate portfolio and expanded into venture capital and private equity and media, and like any business in 2021, it's own SPAC. I was more lucky than smart. I started investing very small in real estate, simply as a hedge to, as my earning power would close, my real estate would not only appreciate what, but create more cash flow. And then I would take their cash flow and I would buy more real estate and other private...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3047,2022-10-15 06:36:26
14822," Our wood clothes, my real estate would not only appreciate what's but create more cashflow. And then I would say their cashflow and I would buy more real estate and other private equity type investments were generated more cashflow. So as my Yankee income went to zero, hopefully my real estate and my businesses would grow over time. And while players nowadays are becoming better and better business brands, few are able to achieve the scale as A-Rod Corps has in such a relatively short amount of time. But understanding how that growth happened in business, just like baseball, has to start at home. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing, right? Like nothing. So I had two hip surgeries and I never wanted to be the old guy that couldn't get up, you know, this there. So I built a flat house all entertainment on that side, my room, your dad and the girls on this side. It had to be one story because I am always forgetting things. And B, I wanted it to be like, oh my god, I can't get up the steps because of these hips. You know, I walk around here, I mean, first of all, the arts are beautiful, but tons of pictures of you and the girls. And I mean, you've really made a family life for yourself here. Tell me about that. Well, tell you what, I'm not at home. I'm not a cleanup hitter and I'm not a CEO. It's very close to remind me every day that I work for them. Yeah. People always ask me, what are you doing your life? And I say the three Bs, I do baseball, not basketball, two, business and my babies. And that's kind of, that's my happy zone. It's funny through pandemic. We spend so much time here and in my 46 years, the toughest time in the world that I've witnessed. On the other side of that, we were in here and we felt safe and we felt loved. And it was like 90 days of breakfast, lunch and dinner with my girls. It was a dream come true. They got so sick of my dad jokes, so sick of my dancing. It's actually what it leads you to take time. I've been begging, trying to bribe, I let you do one with me. She was daddy, you have no swag, no drip. I'm not doing anything with you. A.R.A.D's dancing may not get his daughter's approval, but his following on social media is huge, with nearly 4 million followers on Instagram alone. That number is larger than his new basketball team, the Yankees or the Red Sox, not to mention any other single baseball player, current or former. Who has better taste in music? Whose room is decorated nicer? What is it that makes you engage the way you do in social? You know Jason, a lot of that came through my time during my suspension. You know, I spent a whole year serving a suspension, and in that time I had an opportunity to turn the lens inward and understand why I was making some of the good choices, the poor choices, the bad choices, and understand kind of conversation, understand storytelling. And it's something that I'm enjoying, is still fairly new, we're not experts by any means, so every time we look at companies or opportunities or partnerships is data driven and social driven and it's been quite a tool for us. That suspension, which obviously people will forever associate you with, and there's an interesting choice you make there at that moment and then in subsequent moments to not lean out, to not retreat, but to lean in to some extent. And especially in the last couple of years, tell me about that. If you think about my career, sure I've hit home runs and been part of a world championship team, but I'm also, I'm fifth all time in the history of strikeouts. I mean, that means that only four people in the history of mankind have failed more than me. But I think as a result, I've been, you know, PhD in Phalian, but also an MBA of getting back up.

For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance Bloomberg's covering all things crypto the people the transactions and the technology Bloomberg crypto Tuesdays. I was born in New York raised in Miami so when I got to Miami I was around eight and a half and nine years old. My father left when I was around 10 and at home it was mom my brother Joe my sister Susie they took the role of like my brother became like secretary of sports my sister became the secretary of education and my mom just had to you know make enough money to pay her bills. I think you know my father leaving us at 10 kind of left a huge vacant spot right and I think I I needed to then kind of fill that void by having a collection of mentors. One of those earliest mentors was his baseball coach Rich Hoffman right here at Westminster High School. See walks through this this area a few times. Oh yeah this brings back some pretty cool memories. If you hit a home run here goes to the basketball courts and the pool right and I kind of like it is kind of like this Fenway. Yeah exactly. Set of the green monster you have the green pumps. Yes exactly. Well it's really where I really started to understand the power of mentorship and dreaming big and if you think about it I have one of the most important conversations with coach Rich Hoffman and that happened at 15 the first day I walked on campus. He goes look Alex you're gonna come in this year you're gonna have a good year and then you're going to the junior Olympics to represent the US you'll do well there you get much stronger by that time you'll be like the top junior in the country and then you're senior year you're gonna be the number one pick in the country and then you're gonna be off to the big leagues. Coach you're talking to me. Yeah I'm talking to you Alex and Jason I went home that night and I believe them it just like it changed my complete vision on me and my future and then I did everything in my power not to let coach down so the leader today when I have young people",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3049,2022-10-15 06:44:37
14824," And my future. And then I did everything in my power, and that's how they coached down. So I had a leader today, when I have young people. It's my job to not only give them the opportunity, but to push them and push them to a level where they now see the world in a different way about themselves. That prediction came true. In the 1993 MLB draft, Rodriguez was selected first overall by the Seattle Mariners. And while his playing career was just getting started by the age of 22, he'd invest in his first piece of real estate. It was what I knew best. My mother, she was in a homeowner. She was, we were renters, right? We were tenants. And every 18 months, we would move because the landlord would always raise the rent. And I remember as a young kid saying, boy, if I can ever trade places with the landlord, and they can be the tenant, that would be amazing. I bought my first duplex. And then I owned that for a few years. I sold it for double by four plaques, eight plaques, 60 units, and off we went. When it came to those first investments, whenever he does something, he's going in at 100%. This is Jose Gomez. Everyone calls him Pepe. Along with Jose More, he's the co-seo of Newport Property Construction and also a childhood friend of Rodriguez. From 2004 to 2007, we ended up acquiring 5100 units between Florida and Texas. We renovated him. He would buy him. I would renovate them. And the rest was history. Being a real estate investor, especially in high growth markets like Florida, well, it hasn't been a straight line up for the past two decades. Miami's high-rise condos are monuments to a burst property bubble, while most half of Florida mortgages are underwater. We had this run up to 2007. The prices were going up like this, and then it just fell off a cliff. The great recession crushed owners and developers alike. Few were immune, except those that had other sources of income to take advantage of falling prices. Income like, say, one of the richest baseball contracts in history. Our huge advantage was that Alex had W2 income coming in from playing, and we had that staying power. So we were able, even when things started going, you know, south for some people, we were able to grow within those difficult times. Monument capital management has done within 60 deals since 2012 worth more than $900 million. The extent of that ambition in real estate is evident here at Grand Station in downtown Miami. The 30-story residential tower, complete with a sprawling amenity floor and pool, has sweeping views of downtown. It's a bet on Miami's growth, and it's a bet that's looking smarter as Wall Street firms and other companies look southward. People always question Miami, why do people live there? There's not any great jobs. You know, we don't have a lot of financial services here. We don't have anybody manufacturing anything, but that's changing. People see this as a very cool place to live and work. Now, before it was always a cool place to live, but where you're going to work. Now it's okay, the jobs are here first. Cool place to visit in the past. Right, yeah. And now each pocket is being built out. I think our Basel years and years ago started that, and then there have been a course of events that have followed that continue to enrich Miami, and I would say we're still early as a city. But while Miami may be home base, Rodriguez's most aggressive current real estate project is buying, renovating, and renting out single-family homes in markets across the country. And in this case, he's not just emulating some of the world's biggest investors, but also getting into business with them, including real estate legend Barry Sternley. Just as behemoths like Blackstone who've been mass single-family homes, Rodriguez, through the Tuber Capital Group, has snapped up 5,000 homes so far. We think we're still in the early endings of single-family housing. Rents are going up about 18 to 19 percent. Once we find something, then this I learned from Warren Buffett is, you know, be disciplined, but when you find your pitch, you know, don't go for a single or double, you know, going and going big, and that's exactly what we've done multi-family, and now with single-family homes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3050,2022-10-15 06:49:41
14825," but when you find your pitch, you know, don't go for a single or double, you know, going and going big and that's exactly what we've done multi-family and now with single-family hellers. Going big has required Rodriguez to build a team around him and he's opted for a delicate balance of homegrown and outside hires. On the one side, friends dating back to childhood and adolescence, including Aaron, Pepe and Jose. On the other newer editions such as Kelly Laferia, Stuart Zook, David Becker and Lisa Pire. Managing the chemistry among the small and growing team is akin to the elusive intangibles Rodriguez saw in clubhouses when he was a player. Getting it right, well that's the difference between being a champion and an also ran. Lisa, take it away. So I think next we're going to have David on table, some Kelly and Pepe's at least to the little set of the club. So teams 11-11 and one exciting development is the 12-17 hymn and selectors is going to use piano. So we were not on the Eastman's table in New York. At the A-Word Corp offices, you'll notice the memorabilia, the pictures of famous athletes, the real-time social data being displayed on the TV wall. But you'll also see pictures of Rodriguez with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. Alex has become a sponge and he started that as an active player when he was on the road. He would go and visit the Jerry Rhyne's Dress of the World in his uniform and ask them business questions and he's surrounded himself with really good, smart people. The wide network is critical in sourcing deals, including in the venture world, where the A-Rod portfolio has included more than 60 companies, brands like Hems and Hers, Gopuff and UFC gyms. But having the best team doesn't mean you win every at bat. Their SPAC Slam Corp was recently negotiating a roughly $3 billion deal to merge with collectible company Panini. That didn't materialize after Panini stumbled. Slam's still in search of a target. But Rodriguez's belief in taking swings, striking out and hitting big is also the same way he would end up with his own sports franchise. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our way in some sort of circulation fears. Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Access the financial world on demand.

JLo and A-Rod are angling to buy the New York Mets. They're not just angling. I mean, they are in the process of putting the money together. Rodriguez along with a group that included his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, entrepreneur Mark Lurian several others, mounted a bid against frontrunner and hedge fund billionaire Steven A. Cohen. These guys are all rich, you know, as far as we go, they've made millions and millions of dollars, but we're talking about billions here. The very public process ultimately landed A-Rod and JLo's consortium as the runner up, with Cohen by the team for $2.4 billion. We have a little bit depressed about it.

And so when it just sort of came to a complete halt, it was sort of like the shock to the system. We were sort of depressed and down. Mark Laurie is a New York-born businessman who most recently had been a senior executive at Walmart. He'd gotten there by selling his company, jet.com to the mega retailer and stayed on to run that division. And while ARAD's partnership with Jaila would come undone, he formed a close business and personal connection with Laurie that's lasted. House rules, man. I told you, no, high is man. You can't make a great time. You grew up in a sort of very similar way and from very, very humble beginnings. I love Mark. I love him like a brother and he's a great partner and a great friend and, you know, he's sleep to my house. I sleep at his house and we both have this drive and this mission that I want him to win in the worst way and I think he does the same for me. I want to show you this clip because it spoke to me a lot about the depth of your relationship. Yeah, I think this is getting a little bit deeper now, but I think it comes down to our dads, you know, they both felt like, you know, we had something to prove in order to just sort of feel love really and when you did something spectacular, you felt, oh, maybe, maybe, you know, like, and I think he similarly had felt that too where if you wanted to feel love, you had to do big things. What do you make of that? I never thought about it that way, but I know that when my father left at 10, it left a huge hole in my heart and my stomach and I knew that I had to do better. And I think before therapy, it was probably better for the wrong things. I think post and current, I look at it as just my purpose. But I also know that I'm enough now and probably before that I thought it wasn't. The deep connection with Lori led to a new $400 million venture fund called VCP and notably allowed them to quickly pivot to a successful deal in sports ownership. They're pursuit of the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota links. He called me and he said, hey, are you serious about this? He said, I won't do it unless you're serious about it. And I said, I'm serious about it. Are you serious about it? And again, a minute conversation. We're both in and we probably got the deal done in six or seven days. NBA ownership has radically transformed into the past decade. It's tech executives like Steve Balmer and Joe Sy and Wall Street investors like Mark Lazzari, Josh Harris and Tony Restler have snapped up teams. There's a supply demand imbalance where anyone, you know, most people, if they could, would own a professional sports team and there's, you know, very high barriers to entry and, you know, very limited supply. In the case of the Timberwolves, Glenn Taylor bought the team in 1994 for $88 million. The sale to Rod Regas' group values the franchise paired with the four-time WNBA champion links at $1.5 billion. And that's relatively affordable. A Rod's old team, the Yankees, is worth more than $5 billion, according to several estimates. And while ownership is changing, so too are the players. I think players today want more in every sport. They're into fashion. They want to be good investors. They want to learn about venture. The NBA players today that I've been around, some of them are more prepped at 20 than some of the guys that I played with at were 50. And meeting with our athletes and talking about business and them reaching out to me, it's great, it's humbling, and it's really impressive. And if anything, their ownership has maybe gotten too close to the players. The team being fine $250,000 for violating league rules with an off-season workout in A Rod's hometown of Miami.

14827," But buying a basketball team instead of the meds might accomplish a goal he thought was unreachable, actually making him cool to his daughters. I recently went to a six years game and my little one Ella who's 13, she closed that and really liked this basketball thing. Like one day maybe I get to run the business here one day. Really? And I was like, oh my god, that's like the greatest thing I've ever heard. And she goes, you know, it's like, you know, base was a little slower, but this stuff I can really get into it. I said, whoa, baseball's great too. It's just, you know, it's more of a thinking man's game. It's like chess, not checkers. And she goes, yeah, yeah, whatever. I don't like chess either. But she says this basketball thing, I have like real passion is like the entertainment and I have thoughts and I have ideas. And I, and she thinks much more like a producer. She likes dancing. And I mean, to me, that's just like, boy, that's the great thing about sports and music. It brings people together. And it's only that that for us that night. You have built this, this amazing business. And there are people who are watching this. She's like, this guy, you know, it's like that they'll always remember you for your baseball career and a baseball career that was this controversial to say the least. You could be a little bit on an island somewhere. You don't have to do this. I thought about tapping out a bunch of times. I would wake up in the middle of the night and be in tears going like, how in the world we get pocket aces and figure out a way to screw this up. That was a very painful time for me. And I think the year suspension allowed me to not only put lipstick on the house and paint it and fix the windows, it allowed me to tear the entire house down and start building it one brick at a time. And in that process, I became even closer to my daughters. And when I think about those mistakes and the lessons learned, I think about, okay, but you know what? That was baseball. And I had good moments and I had very tough moments. But clean slate when it comes to being a father, to being a partner, to being a businessman, to being a friend. So I draw some incredible motivation through something that sucked, something that I did to myself. I say to myself in the darkest hour, boy, if I ever get another opportunity, I'm not going to screw that up again. And I'm trying my best not to do that. Okay.

We will never. Lord, now we will never. No. Searching in vain for solid ground in an escalating Russian war in Ukraine in a troubled global economy and goodness knows in the British authorities economic management. This is Bloomberg Wall Street week. This week, Special Administrator Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. The governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nupi her play a huge role at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country. And NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2% and core accelerating to 6.6% year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones, we went to bed last night not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted and called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone after the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the Nasdaq down over 3% and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%.

14829," 3% and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. To help us sort out a wild week in the markets, we welcome now Joanne Fini, partner in advisors capital management and Lizanne Saunders, chief investment strategist at Chow Schwab. So welcome back both of you to Wall Street Week. Let me start with you, Lizanne. What happened this week? I feel like we hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day. You did see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517. And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying, hedges being taken off, some short covering, and that fed on itself through the end of the day. You could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joanne, a fair amount of noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there. But on Friday, actually, they gave up pretty much everything they got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know, David, I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Let's say there's a lot of talk about it. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joanne's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility, but financial system instability, maybe what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates. And I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digesting to come, particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual, it's not just the inflation problem. The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And the risks that are out there haven't really abated in many ways, although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne, I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world, we've gone to a multiple or economy, it feels like sometimes. We have, and I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded, is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pentound demand on the good side, you saw pent up demand on the services side. That tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3055,2022-10-15 07:11:22
14830," And on the services side, that tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now, on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slowdown, downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way, because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones, where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding, while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment, from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based, like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific, where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending, like Walmart saw, right? Whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going, and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, Joanna, your point about the upper end in better shape is what is by what the retailers are saying. There's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that, even though the excess saving story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we all talk about, when is the market going to bond them out? When is the bad news bond about? When do we know we've got it all out? We know how to deal with the bulb from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk, the global economy is facing. It's not just the US and inflation problems globally. We have the war in Ukraine. And there are some, maybe low probability, but very large risks associated with that. And then you have China. And they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high level chips and the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, a hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world, then now we might find that US companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point. And we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Joanne Fini and Lizanne Sauners will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and back to our Wall Street week. I'm Bloomberg.

14831," Music Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. Music We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now, startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Music Well, this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for. And then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. And the housing industry's trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That, of course, was Louis Ruckus here on Wall Street. Back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now, when all the markets wanted, was a slowing economy and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. And the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now, the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down. And the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfini of advisors, capital management, and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So, Joe, let me come to you. The question is, what do we do other money in this world? Where does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors. It really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so, one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now, as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. So, one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's General Mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the 4, 5, 6% range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But, you know, it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Lizanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in the part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do, but gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market components of",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3057,2022-10-15 07:19:43
14832," actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds tight and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market components of say big tech and look at it monolithically make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're an arising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, lower volatility. It's just kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we're going to bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now. And they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that in a balanced strategy with the equity front, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done and it's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Liz Ann, are you to the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer duration for the income? So my my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a from a teen environment. There is no alternative to Tia. There is an alternative. And there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies and a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, you know, Liz Ann, I wanted to pick up. That was exactly the point I was going to make is the challenges that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if if the client has appropriate risk tolerances in time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now, what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash so that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated for that cost of inflation or rote in the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Liz Ann, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth. And for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine, what are earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week, they're earnings, which actually were pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub though is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3058,2022-10-15 07:24:25
14833," It has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S&P earnings growth. But you exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And that's, if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook, if you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that are matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking an account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if when how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple of years, three years, five years, right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Anson, it's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

Coming up, if we're really serious about getting to zero missions, experts say expanded nuclear power has to be part of the plan. We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3060,2022-10-15 07:32:20
14835," in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world. And we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that, Amol. First of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you saw, in an example, of what happens when you take nuclear offline, when California took the San Anofary nuclear reactor offline, their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions. I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety. And you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And they're based on our history. You can prove that, in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long. It's been used as, frankly, a fundraiser, a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand, particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference, particularly if you think about the rural parts of America, where you're not on the grid, or you're not close to the grid. You can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town, or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety, because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear, or is it technological development, such as you're referring to small modular reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that, when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods, and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one footfall field to the height of the goalposts. They might have gotten slightly above that now, because this was data from several years ago. But the point being, it's not this massive thing, this size of the state of Vermont, that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is, 97 to 90% fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that, and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the, quote unquote, bad stuff, to down to 15%. Let's say, and it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that you explained to them, because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. And there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system, really, that you had the partial meltdown, Fukushima Daiichi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power. Their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our Nuclear Regulatory Commission said to our nuclear...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3061,2022-10-15 07:40:48
14836," or backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with a reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, then, in fact, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was not even 10 years ago, I guess there were two four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. We were very hopeful that those were going to come in on budget and on time, and they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles, but you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamlined how you approach them, so that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this, is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in, and that's one of the big challenges that seems to get so overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not, I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former Governor Christine Todd, Whitman Now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributed Larry Summers of Harvard. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever given by anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling at the wrong time? And they sell when the prices go down? Yes, or not keeping. People have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3062,2022-10-15 07:44:30
14837," This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week, he is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we waited for this week. And boy, they came in, how to expect it. It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure, which is wages. Or you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking. And I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Kroobman, who are very quick now to focus on housing. And the fact that the private indices lead to public indices when the private indices are looking soft, but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. So I think we've got to be very, very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation? How can you tell? What are you looking at right now to tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component. Whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices. And very crucially for me I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything. And all of those are saying that inflation is not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers Larry, a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and more importantly the management of the British economy. Look I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 17th inning of this particular set of challenges. I had said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition. I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down the road. So I think we're going to see more tremors more after shocks more problems. At the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry I guess I'm",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3063,2022-10-15 07:48:48
14838," We have accesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry, I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time we have central banks and development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're going to see similar, won't be the same, but similar sorts of problems elsewhere, particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit, some of the non bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector, I think more of them may be international. You know something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions at all these countries. But don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. And I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There's some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IIF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece. Also actually speaking with David Maltes, the head of the World Bank about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach. And we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital. And instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there's a lack there Larry, often that lack comes for a lack of leadership. We not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House or for that matter at the World Bank. I mean, would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very, very difficult moment in Africa at a very, very difficult moment in Latin America at a very, very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did was put to semiconductors and China. The chip's market really went down substantially. It took a lot of the tech with it. At a time of so much difficulty globally, what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know, the kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation in semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3064,2022-10-15 07:53:23
14839," All judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw, which depend on classified information, which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was a pretty across the board effort in something that's very, very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far reaching implications. Very finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on. And that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else. It was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Divvig using mathematics. Careful, historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. OK, thank you so much to Larry Summers.

Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Yeah, too. Yeah. My guest this week is the Pulitzer Prize winning Americanologer Lindsay.agi. Ukraine, Afghanistan, South Sudan, to name but a few. She has been there with her camera at the majority of the conflicts in the 21st century. I want to hear about the stories behind those images and what it's like living, working, existing on the front lines of these waltz. Lindsay, thank you so much for joining me and joining all of our viewers. I know it's rare for you to be sitting in a seat safely away from what you're covering normally with your camera. You've come to the world's attention many times with your work over the years, but very recently, at the beginning of this year, in fact just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine, you did come to the attention of many people because you took a photo of a Ukrainian family of trying to cross a bridge who had been killed and that photo ended up on the front pages of the New York Times. Can you tell me a bit about how you came to that seat? I went and I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately was covering sort of daily missile strikes and the destruction and those who had been killed and injured. One day, I was watching images come out from the wires and others who went to the European bridge and there were hundreds of civilians crossing, the elderly, women, children crossing out of your peen and all of those suburbs. We made our way toward the bridge through side roads. As we approached, the territorial defense soldiers were taking injured over to a brick wall off to the side. We ran across the street and almost as soon as we got behind that wall, a round came in. It was either a mortar rounder or tank shell, we're not sure. It came in and hit off to the distance and then the Ukrainian military fired back. My security adviser said, would you like to go? I said no because everyone knows this is a civilian evacuation route and those rounds are probably going toward a Ukrainian base that's off in the distance. But how wrong I was. The next round came in closer and so we dove for cover and as soon as we popped back up, the next round came in right next to us essentially. It was sort of equidistant between us and a mother and her two children and a church volunteer that was helping us for them to safety. It was very chaotic and obviously we were all sort of in shock because the round had landed very close to us. Everything was very dusty and our security adviser immediately went to the aid of the injured and to a soldier who was nearby. By the time he called us over, the protocol as we wait to be told, it's clear you can come. By the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured but I anticipated it being a soldier. Although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean because nothing was...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3067,2022-10-15 08:06:46
14842," being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean because nothing was shielded, so people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course, I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point, I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of a sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed, you know, something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. So we were, our security adviser Steve was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly and we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces so that we had some options. Well, the image you, I'm talking about, certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way, now you've said that, the way that you look at the image, you can't see them, but you can see them. It's more you look at the scenes of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting as horribles, that sounds because obviously I've just witnessed the most devastating scene, but I'm also a photojournalist and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles. And frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the, by I think the United States ambassador to the United Nations to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted because I was there. I witnessed the run up and I, and I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position.

Indians make up about three-force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US. And it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the C-suite. You mentioned being a mother, has that changed the job? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that. But for me making decisions on a minute-to-minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going sort of all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps, when you see an image, when you create an image, when you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you, would have always affected you. I imagine. Has it changed, though? Yes, it has changed. I think, you know, I photographed, I have photographed children dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Somalia during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. But it was always devastating, but I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother. And I know, you know, I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. So, you're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. And perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, would you say you have become desensitized, though? No. And do you have to be, in any way? No, not at all. I mean, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment. But you know, part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs. And looking through the viewfinder, that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional. And that's okay. I mean, I, you know, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but, you know, I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think, I mean, you talk about hanging back because of the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front. And yet, when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive. When you know you're not where you need to be and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with because if I'm close and something happens a little closer or a little further from me, but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think my, where I'm positioning myself is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. You know, if I hear that the school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. You know, if I hear that a building has been hit on the front line, but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although, that building's been hit, but no civilians have been killed. I mean, this talks to the idea of not you per se, but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies, trying to find the very worst to document. And being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? You know, for me, the highest toll of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie. That is documenting reality. And the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another and every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presumably that for you in this work that you do, you don't obviously just cover war, you cover humanitarian disaster, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3069,2022-10-15 08:15:22
14844," War you covered humanitarian disaster climate, change the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself, to your family, and to those who could be critical, is that you are providing evidence. Yeah, and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others, of the actual killers before? I mean, I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. You know, they obviously don't allow us access to things when they are killing civilians. You know, I think that there was a time in the Korngall Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd, me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times Magazine, and the point was to understand the nuances of war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. And in fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Korngall Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency, because he believed that journalists needed to understand sort of the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. And so we were in Operation Rock Avalanche, which was in the movie The Documentary Restrepo. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days, and eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. And we were ambushed from three sides, and there was a huge gun battle. Three soldiers were shot, one was killed, and in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers. Everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields. And he literally had me look through the scope of his gun, and there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness. And I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops, and really was willing to risk my life, and to be there in the middle of Operation Rock Avalanche. A shot you took during that maneuver, we're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush, where it's a very dusty picture. It is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rughal, and he's in a body bag, and it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is sort of leading the way, is crying, and they're walking through this very sort of desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? You know, what are we doing here? Years after 9-11, fighting in the middle of the mountains, where there are no people, you know? And it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind, and for us to have a look at and talk about an 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So, in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship. That is, in America, it's called a Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from a cellist to a scientist to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work, because it was the first time I could decide not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research, and I decided to focus on maternal mortality, and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And I scan it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3070,2022-10-15 08:19:41
14845," and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours and imagine being in labor, you know, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain. And there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. And we stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? And it turned out the woman on the right, Norene Soe was in labor. And Norene Soe's husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so determined to not lose her that he managed to get a car in the village. But when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. So I said, well, just get my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Fiasabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, okay, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road, you know. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly, and brought him back in the whole family piled in my car. And we took them to the hospital. And everyone asked me if she delivered safely. And if I took photographs, and yes, she delivered safely. But no, I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course of that story with my presence by taking them. So you took a photo. I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames. And that's when you had met. And just seeing it. Because it's so striking, the blue. Exactly. I met them. We asked their story and then we asked permission right before Ziba left to find the husband. We asked permission for me to take a few photographs. Lots happening on Wall Street.

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. The signal shipping is the key component of global trade. About 80% and 90% of all the world's goods are transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's is your true mission from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stock maritime behemoths? I think on balancing a woman has been a help to you. A huge help. Being a woman. Rather than a hindrance. Yes, everyone thinks it's a hindrance, but in fact, it's a huge help because people, first of all, have access to men and women. And particularly when I'm working in countries like Afghanistan and Somalia, where men and women are usually segregated by gender. And people underestimate women I find, and they still do. And so they sort of discount me and say,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3071,2022-10-15 08:24:41
14846," Men and women are usually segregated by gender. And people underestimate women I find, and they still do. And so they sort of discount me and say, okay, sure, sure, go. Nice to be underestimated. Yeah, I love being underestimated. I love being underestimated. I love it. Yeah. It's one of those things. But I mean, I suppose on the other serious, much more serious side of it is that, again, when you're thinking and calculating risks, you know, rape as a weapon of war is a unique tool wielded against women. Yes. And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice. The first time was in Iraq, and that was only a day, and it turned out, compared to Libya, was quite sort of, it was manageable in the sense that we were working outside of Fulugia. I was working with a colleague from the New York Times. We had heard a helicopter of American troops went down. We went to find it. We got cop-in surgeons who thought maybe we were with the American occupation. We finally convinced them we were journalists. They held us until dusk, and then eventually let us go. Obviously, it was terrifying. We had guns to our heads for about 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally, we had been two in each car, but one of the cars, one of the driver's brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle, and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion, because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous a situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Gaddafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels we had been covering started opening fire on that checkpoint, so we were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me is the only woman. I was sort of left sitting there, because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored, so I had to get out of the car, because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the backseat, and when I jumped out, Gaddafi's troops came to me and was pulling at my cameras. Instinctively, I was pulling back, even though there were bullets, literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind the checkpoint building, and we're all told to lie face down on the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads, and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said, you can't execute them, they're American, which this was all in Arabic, and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. In retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American, because in the Middle East, a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded, and essentially for the next three days, we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution, and for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly, I was not raped, but of course, in that time being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of ironically looked to them for strength, because I thought, well, if they survived it, and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just minutes a minute? A minute to minute. I mean, in a kidnapping, there is no sort of an outward on the line. It is literally every second is survival mode. It is, what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? I mean, it sounds like the scene from a film, and yet it's your life. And I believe Jennifer Lawrence has been interested in your life all of that was told of the film. She was. We spent about three years together when Warner Bros. optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that, called It's What I Do, a Photographer's Life of Love and War. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3072,2022-10-15 08:28:22
14847," I wrote a memoir after that called It's What I Do, a photographer's life of love and more. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. It's not like taking Jennifer Lawrence to Walshine. I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be close to a war zone. Obviously we had to worry about her safety. So I couldn't take her. I got a word about why I would a list while you're deep in with this. It was very stressful. Let's just say when I put her on the plane from Uganda, I could walk for a week. My back went out. But yeah, but she eventually dropped out. And so now it is being made into a limited series. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. Okay. But you, at least Jennifer Lawrence now knows what it's like to do your job. She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. So I think she got inspiration from it. But what have you learned that from being in these scenarios, coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah. I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness. The fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous. And yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered. But I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after. Well, thank you very much for taking us behind the lens with you. Thank you. Lindsay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye.

That's a slogan of ZUX, a California-based company hoping to revolutionize personal transportation. It's creating an entirely new autonomous vehicle targeted at the Robotaxi market. Just don't call it a car. A car is, there is an inference that there is a driver, especially a human driver. And from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver. Whereas in our Robotaxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. The name ZUX is a reference to a marine organism that, like the Robotaxi, depends on renewable energy and is able to maintain a symbiotic relationship with its surrounding habitat. Chief Executive, Aisha Evans says sustainability is at the heart of what they do. But it's keen to stress that going green means more than just one thing. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, sharp and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability. Not just any justification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. In this episode of Leaders Goes Green, I speak to ZUX Chief Executive, Aisha Evans, about the challenges of developing artificial intelligence, being acquired by Amazon, and making a driverous future a reality. Aisha, thank you so much for joining us on Leaders with Lackwin. Amazon acquired ZUX back in January 2020 for what reports suggested was $1.2 billion. Since then, the company has revealed it's ZUX vehicle. This is, I think, a rectangular passenger focused vehicle with no driver's seat or steering wheel. First of all, how would you describe it? We describe it as a purpose-built vehicle, but it's video robot taxi that's its purpose. And essentially, it's about transporting people from point A to point B on demand. And in the most effective, cleanest and most enjoyable way. Why won't you call it a car? Because a car is, there is an inference that there is a driver. And in our case, especially a human driver. And from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver, the hood, so that you can see ahead of you, the windshield, even the seating arrangement, and the people you're transporting do not bother you. Whereas in our robot taxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. So is there a piece of technology? I sure that you wish you'd have at your hands to make it better, to make it workable 100%. No, I'd time, if I could accelerate through time. That's really, that would be fantastic. Look, it's about testing. We can drive. That's not the issue. The issue is, and we follow the rules very well. I always say that when it comes to products that use self driving technology, there are two numbers that are too metrics that are really important. Safety. We know that in the United States, on average, over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help us. We actually spiked up to over 43,000. And...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3074,2022-10-15 08:36:43
14849," but lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help us. We actually spiked up to over 43,000. And those are mostly caused by the human driver's errors. Human were not at times the most disciplined. We're looking on phones. We're maybe a little bit de-habitated because of a couple of glasses of wine or we're talking to somebody. And that causes errors. But computers are very good at not making those types of errors. But there's another statistic that's really important is that on average, in the United States, humans collectively drive 100 million miles before causing a fatality. Just think about it. 100 million miles. And it takes a lot of testing, a lot of statistical math and forecasting to meet and beat that number because we strive to be better than humans. So when you focus on safety, I said, how much in advance can actually zoogs predict events that are about to happen? We can predict things. So the way the AI stack works is, first of all, and this goes to our robot taxi and the sensor architecture and compute. It's important to maximize all of your chances to see what is going on around you and in your environment. And this is why our sensor architecture uses camera, light hours, radars, and long wave infrared cameras. So that, for example, we can sense heat and something is alive. This is why we have them at the top four corners so that at any point in time, three of those sensor pods are basically seeing you. And then the compute, being able to basically fuse all of that information and data on a continuous basis. And then predict what are the agents around us going to do, potentially, and therefore, how should we react and we're constantly in that loop? And the better and the faster you can do that, and basically, the more we'll be there. But that's not really the issue we're having with the testing. The issue we're having with the testing is what I call the millions of unique edge cases, last minute things that happen, that humans basically are very good at dealing with. I like to say that you've been learning to deal with them as a human ever since you came out of the hospital, basically, as a baby. You're already seeing cars, agents, when do I cross, when don't I cross, all those types of things. So that accumulated knowledge is what computers are not very good at. But we're able to run a certain level of prediction. But what is this concretely? So is this reflexes? Is this morality issues? It's things that, for example, another human broke the rule. They came onto your oncoming lane. You could say, hey, you're not supposed to come on my oncoming lane. But the reality is that when your human drivers see somebody else come on their oncoming lane, they assess the situation and quickly either stop, slow down, go around something. It's all of those little mini maneuvers every time something's different happens. So you're trying to, you're not only trying to replicate the human mind, right? And I don't know how long away we are from that. It could be decades, are you trying to better or to make better decisions in the human mind? We're trying to make, I don't know that they are better than the human mind, but for a robot, they make a lot of sense. So we're trying to make the kind of parallel applicable decisions so that we're moving people around. And so that means we won't normally, we won't necessarily replicate what a human driver would have done. But we'll make a maneuver, a responding maneuver that makes a lot of sense is safe, keeps the flow of traffic and also our customers comfortable. I mean, you have such a complex industry that you're dealing with. It's AI, it's regulation. It's of course actually making the vehicle. What would you describe your company as? We basically are a mobility on demand company from point A to point B, first for human transport. That business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're on an app today, whichever app you choose, what shows up is a passenger car with a human driver. So the business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3075,2022-10-15 08:41:20
14850," shows up is a passenger car with a human driver. So that's the business. It exists already. All we're doing is replacing the tool, meaning it's not going to be a passenger car with a human driver. It's going to be a robot taxi that comes in. It's a more enjoyable experience. It's electric. Yes, it uses self-driving technology to move it, but that's it. So for those who thinks we're doing everything, we're not, we're doing the van diagram of what is necessary to accomplish that goal. So how far away do you think we're from accomplishing that goal? You're talking about, for example, gathering information, the perception phase, right, which is cameras, radars, inference. And lidar. Look, it depends. We tend to be very realistic about what's going on here. This is a beginning of a wave. When you look at all of the big industry transformation, they did not happen overnight. They took quite a while. So in a geofan's area, we hope to be out there very soon. Our focus is being on public roads with our robot taxi soon. But it will be in a moderate, small to moderate scale. And then the question is, how ability to be able to add geofancies, to add cities on a continuous basis and in a way that is sort of good for customers? Because there's no point in doing it in one tiny little geofan's and not being able to go to a bigger geofan's. Because then the customers will be like, this is a gimmick. When is that coming to me? Up next, evolution isn't always a smooth process. And Aisha Evans expects things will get bumpy on the road to the future of personal transportation. But she says innovation will find a way. One thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. A fundamental change in the way we move around will require a fundamental rethinking of the way cities are built, especially when taking sustainability into account. Carry on the conversation with Zouk's chief executive, Aisha Evans. When you focus on green or sustainability, how do you think this will change cities? So I think it will improve things dramatically. The fleet will be, oh, is fully electric. That's a good thing. Second of all, today, humans, when we buy a car, we actually only use it 4% of the time. The rest of the time, it's parking either in our garage or in somebody else's garage or in the street and taking time. And so just from a mathematical standpoint, we're building more things than we need strictly for human transport. So we will make less things because when you're not using the robot axis, somebody else is using it. So it's very effective and efficient. Now, I call it an improvement because we as an industry, and I mean, overall, there needs to be a lot of improvement in the battery ecosystem, whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the using of them, as well as what happens on the end of life of a battery. And I believe that they are still a lot of work to do. But I think there'll be a lot of innovation in that space.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3076,2022-10-15 08:45:44
14851," of them as well as what happens on the end of life of a battery. And I believe that they are, they are still a lot of work to do. But I think there'll be a lot of innovation in that space. But when do you think we'll have the first off driving robotaxi in a big city that's also very eco-friendly? It's going to be, I don't know, if we don't get into dates at Zooks because we feel that it's better to show and then tell than the opposite as an industry and you know this I'm saying an industry meaning I think everyone included with me too many, oh it will happen. We've kind of like been, oh my gosh it's going to happen tomorrow morning. Oh my gosh it's never going to happen. So we don't really get into the dates. But within definitely a more realistic time frame that maybe some people are quoting out there. I mean, testing has started for all of us. And so I think it's much sooner than people realize. The question will be the game of then replicating that to several cities, to an entire country and then to several countries. Were you frustrated or are you frustrated? Now when you started, did you think it would be quicker to have these self-driving robotaxies or slower? You're going to out me. That's not nice. I actually think it's going about. I thought it would be even slightly slower. You know, even the ecosystem of driving, right, or with passenger cars, from the cars and buggy and all of the infrastructure that comes around it to where we are today, it took a little bit of while, right? And so I actually think that it's going at the correct pace. It's slightly slower, maybe than I expected, but it's about the pace. This is a big deal, this is a hard technology and this is a societal transformation. At the same time, we talk a lot about this environmental transformation, maybe taking longer than we were expecting because of some components not being readily available. Do you worry for the car industry for the industry urine that we just don't have the right components for the battery or for the self-driving vehicles? I think we have the right component at this point in time. The question is, how are we going to stimulate the industry, academia, research, governments, regulatory to pour a lot into this space? It's not just about having mandates. By 2000X, all cars will be XYZ. There's a whole infrastructure across all of the different vectors, including academia and research, that also has to come with us so that we have enough innovation for the scale that's going to be necessary. How do you change people's perceptions? I imagine that you're worried that in certain countries, people won't want to give up their cars. Yes, disruption is always interesting. There are a lot of countries whose economies depend on the car industry. I do worry about that, but I think that one of the mistakes we've made in terms of disruption is to not have engineering empathy for the company or the country that's being disrupted. I think it's better to have conversations now. Figure out how we manage through the transition together as opposed to good or bad. Because one thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. I like to say sometimes for effect that if you could wake up somebody who died 2000 years ago magically, and then drop them in the middle of New York City or Mumbai or Cape Town, they literally couldn't function. They would know what to do. I think that we need to be generous with each other and manage through the transition together, but understand that this is unstoppable and inevitable. Even someone who passed maybe 100 years ago would be complete. We lost in New York City. Exactly. They would be looking for the stable and the buggy and the coach and be like, no, no, no, you need to either buy a car, take the subway, take public transportation or call a mobility. And by the way, where's your phone? No, no, we don't mean this phone. We need a phone that's a computer in your pocket. Do you know what an app is? So yes, that's why I think that we just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But if we look at the last, let's say, 20, 30 years, it's amazing the pace of change and how quick that was in the last.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3077,2022-10-15 08:50:00
14852," We just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But if we look at the last, let's say, 20, 30 years, it's amazing. The pace of change and how quick that was in the last six to seven years. Can we replicate that again? Oh, I'm confidence we can. Look, I, um, prior to being in this industry, I was in the wireless industry. Had a lot of fun with that from, you know, people forget even the landline was an evolution, right? It used to be switch boards and an operator needed to be on the other end of that. And then from there, we went to cell phones. I remember being in a lab when we received the first text, uh, string, uh, on an LCD screen, uh, through, um, uh, GPS and edge. But then we were already working in research on LTE and, uh, basically Wi-Fi and all these things. And we were dreaming of have people having the internet in their pocket and what that, what that would enable. By the way, we didn't really think about apps or anything like that. But we just trusted that with the availability of that, of the, of the infrastructure, people will innovate on top of that. And boy, did they? And I expect the exact same thing to happen in the self driving space. Up next, Aisha Evans on what life is like being part of the Amazon family. No, I don't hang out with bezels and drassy and limp and, I mean, this is a job. Uh, they want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. Uh, they want us to build a great company and that's really the basis of the relationship. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. We all know Jeff Bezos has otherworldly travel ambitions, but his acquisition of Zooks in 2020 proved that the Amazon boss very much has his eye on the future of transport on this planet too. I continue the conversation and Zooks chief executive Aisha Evans. What's it like being part of the Amazon family? Do you get much exposure to Jeff Bezos? I get this question a lot. First of all, we love being inside Amazon. We literally are grateful and privileged because this takes a lot of capital. There are a lot of really good success stories and also good learnings at Amazon about being long term oriented and being part of creating a new industry and driving to use a cliché transformation. We get a lot of good advice. It's been really great. No, I don't hang out with Bezos and Jassy and Lemp. This is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company and that's really the basis of the relationship.

14853," you were growing up, you were always, from my understanding, very passionate about science and technology. You know, when you were kid, it's funny. I wish I could get a redo, because man, I would be a lot more chilled than, I mean, I knew I wanted to study and be in the field of science and technology. I knew I wanted to match it and mix it with what enabled things for humanity and society across all continents, but exactly what form that would take and whether I was going to make it. I often think about, you know, when something bad happens to a human, I often think about, well, why them and not me? So no, I was a lot more stressed out about, is it, isn't going to work out, than am I going to be exactly here? But I'm pretty unhappy to be here. I feel blessed. Is that the kind of advice that you give to, if someone very young work to come and see you and say, like, I don't know what the jobs of tomorrow, what the future brings, what should I study at university? What would you tell them? So first, I always tell people, spend a lot of time with yourself. The longest relationship you're going to have in life is with yourself. Understand who you are. I can tell you that I don't know that I fully understand Isha yet, but there are a lot of things I understand. Simple example, you know, Isha likes disruption. So do not put Isha in charge of something that doesn't need to be disrupted, because she'll mess it up. And that doesn't make me good or bad. It just makes me different. So spend a lot of time with yourself. Second thing is understand your passions, because if something doesn't feel like work, it feels, you love it. I know that's a cliche, then you'll be able to go through the ups and downs of it, and you'll be able to evolve with it. Third, I believe that the blend is the most important thing right now. I think not understanding technology at all is going to make it difficult if you want to be in that field or in sort of the field that drive things, but understanding empathy and humanity and blending technology with that is where it's at. I mean, AI is all about that at the end of the day. Talk to me a little bit. If you have to choose between sustainability, right? If you look at Suks, it's sustainable, it's green, but this very advanced technology for a driverless. If you had to choose between the two, which one would you choose? It's a non-choice. They have to advance together. Now, we can make some compromises short term versus medium term versus long term, but it has to go together. I mean, sustainability, and that's one of the things that's a little bit of a bad people of mine. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, shop and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. What kind of leader are you? An evolving leader, a learning leader. I place a lot of focus on people. At the end of the day, my job is to serve the people so that we can reach the goal. I can't do anything by myself. I already know what I think. And so what's more important is how do I enable others? How do I understand why they think the way they do? And how do how do we get to the same goal? I think that I'm a little bit of a control freak, but this is some in rehabilitation. I've been on it for 15 years. That's probably the thing that's the hardest. And it manifests itself usually on Fridays at 5 p.m. And so everybody at Zouk knows that if you're going to schedule a difficult meeting on Friday at 5 p.m. You might need to manage through Aisha because I'm just exhausted by that time. And my ability to control myself is not as effective. Do you remember the hardest day in your career? And what did you learn from it? I've had plenty of hard days. One hard day was at Intel. I was in a very, very, very difficult meeting and situation. I was angry coming out of that meeting. And I will always be grateful to Stacey Smith. He was the CFO back then. He gave me a call and he said, how are you feeling? I said not good. I use choice words. And I'm going to do",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3079,2022-10-15 08:58:39

And he basically said, look, first of all, I hear you. I understand why you feel that way. Why don't we do this? If Monday morning you still feel like sending that email, then send it. But hold it in your inbox until Monday. And needless to say, I didn't send it Monday. I learned a lot from that sponsorship, generosity, being proactive, managing your triggers and so on. I would say that I've had some tough zoos moments, especially around choosing what to do long-term. But stay through to your principle and play the long game, not the short game, because with zoos, if we have chosen the short game, it would have been not good for the company in the long run. I should thank you so much for joining us today. Francine, my pleasure. Thank you. I'm going to name a couple of your babies. I don't know if I'm asking you to choose amongst your children. But you know, some of the most recognizable buildings by, of course, the Millennium Bridge, London City Hall, the Reichstag, and the Great Court British Museum. What was your favorite project to do? The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral and there's a public building that's sustained. It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which, as I mentioned earlier, is the ultimate in sustainability. If you can give a new life to a building, it also creates public space at the roof level. It's the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them. And that, of course, was made possible by the politicians. So it's a demonstration of democracy in action. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates.

14855," In 2021, Shake Shack was looking to hire a new chief financial officer. Fast-casual restaurant chain found the perfect candidate in an unexpected place. Wall Street. I had worked at Goldman Sachs for about 16 years. I was covering the restaurant sector. Katie and I worked together for a long time. She was an analyst covering our stock. The day that I knew I was looking for a new CFO, the day that I announced it, I went to a recruiter and I said, what about Katie Fogarty? I remember working with her. You think she might be interested in this? That same day, she had heard about it and went to her family and said, this is the job I want. Literally that same day. It was something that I always wanted to take a more of a leadership role at a company. We hit it off. Katie Fogarty spent the first part of her career asking hard questions about corporate strategy. How she's responsible for answers. I think that there's a number of things that a cell-side research analyst can lend to a company, especially a company that is in high growth mode. One, it's just really a very firm ability to analyze strategic decisions, to really get into the numbers, into the models, and to have a firm view of different scenarios out there. When those Wall Street executives move into the company seat, they bring an understanding of hopefully of the fundamentals, company sector, but also what it means to be a stock. The total stakeholder perspective includes shareholders. How are we measuring the incrementality of a great offer like this? Katie's skill set, so uniquely, is able to harvest in her mind so much data and information, turn it quickly into tremendous insights that end up driving our strategic priorities. That is her sweet spot. I look at a CFO from Wall Street as someone who can bring a breath of fresh air to a business that often can become very in bread. They're extremely grounded in data. They're curious about data. They're pushing the data. They know what to do with the data and tie that into telling the story. There's a reality check that Katie brings to the business to say, you know, I know you think this. But let me tell you what the data is really telling us. She's still looking at data to predict the future. Only now, she's taking it a step further. Before, it was a lot of kind of sitting almost in an armchair type basis and analyzing different and now, you know, pieces of information to see where I thought the best investment dollar would be allocated. Here, it is actually driving a plan of how we can best maximize shareholder returns. It is about leveraging data analytics, driving real insights through, you know, not just your own guest data, but leveraging statistical models and really kind of figuring out where the best strategic decisions will be made over time. This is an industry that really needs that type of analysis that help the strategic vision now more than ever. And so it was incredibly exciting to start to apply that here at Shake Shack. Shake Shack began as a humble hot dog cart in New York's Madison Square Park. It opened its first restaurant as a kiosk in that park in 2004. A decade later, there were more than 60 Shake Shack restaurants around the world. And in early 2015, the company went public. At the end of 2021, Shake Shack and its license partners operated nearly 400 locations in 16 countries. At least 60 more are expected to open by the end of 2022. We always feel like we're just getting started at Shake Shack. Somehow, you know, we kind of describe ourselves as a public startup. We have a huge footprint and white space out there that we can grow globally. And we're going to continue to do that. The pace of expansion is nothing new for this company, but maybe different is the shape. Shake Shack has thrived in high density urban locations, which provided 60% of revenues before the pandemic. But return to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable, hampering sales growth in cities. Now Shake Shack is exploring new formats as it...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3081,2022-10-15 09:07:15
14856," pandemic, but returned to office patterns during COVID have been unpredictable hampering sales growth in cities. Now Shake Shack is exploring new formats as it extends its footprint in suburbs. It is not just a reaction to COVID. This is stuff that we've been working on before. What COVID did was accelerated the pace and excitement, frankly, for some of the things that we've been planning before. Drive-through amongst them as the most important. We were right at a pivotal moment of thinking drive-throughs were obsolete and then COVID hit and it was a saving grace. When you get out into the suburban areas, drive-in becomes incredibly important because that's convenience and if a significant percentage of your business is drive-up, you need a smaller facility. So the investment can be smaller. This is the first time the company has ever you know put in a drive-through. We opened up our first one in December of last year. We have six open, very exciting stuff. Drive-through lanes offer long-term opportunities to build revenue and increase margins. But right now they carry a higher price tag. Overall we've seen and you know a rise in our build costs. We talk about 10 to 15 percent higher build costs across the board. Things are just costing more. It makes site selection ever more important. It makes all of the work that we do in real estate and that whole process you know incredibly more important. Since Katie Fogarty became CFO of Shake Shack in June 2021, inflation has risen at a record rate making her job that much harder. Everything that enters our business, commodities, foods, cost of building restaurants is getting more expensive. I don't see that ending anytime soon and we've got to continue to plan for it. If you look at the price of beef, if you look at the price of dairy, eggs, all of these core things, even paper and packaging. It's just meaning that everything costs us more and more and more and we're not alone. This is happening to the entire industry right now. The industry is also dealing with a sea change on the labor front. Hourly wages have soared and the great resignation has hit restaurants hard. Labor costs aren't going down because of the training and turnover at the 30, 60 and 90 day mark. If someone's you know can even figure the job out, do they stay and and that's still not under control whatsoever. So while maybe like the actual wage inflation can taper, turnover and training costs are still elevated. We've invested more than $10 million in our employees over the past year and we're going to continue to invest more. We're testing four day work weeks to help, you know, especially our working parents kind of juggle that balance between childcare and your work. I know I deal with that all the time. This is really a people first company. In even an inflationary environment, you're going to see us continue to lead with our people. Do you worry at all about a price wage spiral, not just here, but in the industry, in the economy? Yes and I think that, you know, this is something that, you know, many business leaders are focused on and, you know, time will tell kind of how all of this lands. I think the wage price spiral continues for quite some time and I think we probably have been a lot less aggressive than we can be and than many other companies have. In terms of raising crisis. Yes, we've taken our time. If you look at the 20 year history of pricing in this company, we've taken about 2% a year on average. We've never taken what we could, we've always taken what we should. We have to pay people more. We have been and we'll continue to do so. We'll take a little bit of a margin compression on that as we've had to and I think that's the right thing so that for the long term, Shake Check continues to be what we're building, which is the next generation's burger joint. Shake Check margins have come down from pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, the company's cash position has improved. During COVID, we actually took two opportunities to raise capital. We have a fortress balance sheet like we've never had before. Good timing, good planning. So when we use that money, we're looking for a great return. The area with the highest potential return is right in Katie Fogredy's wheelhouse, advancing Shake Shacks digital transformation. It's amazing to sit here and think that this is a company that had essentially hardly any digital sales prior to the pandemic. And when the pandemic hit, we went full force on digital with the app web with third party delivery. And here we are now with, 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels, even as our in-shack business has been available. That doesn't count the kiosks, right? That does not count the kiosk. When we look at it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3082,2022-10-15 09:11:48
14857," 43% of our sales still coming from digital channels, even as our in-shack business has been available. That doesn't count the kiosks, right? That does not count the kiosk. So what kind of investment was that? Was it a home run? Is that something where you're like, Randy, this paid off big time. Well, it's something that we continue to invest in. And we continue to see opportunities to improve our app, improve that guest experience, improve the ways that we're incentivizing our guests to really lean into our digital channels. If you simply kind of look at what the higher frequency we get from those digital guests, moving more and more of them into the channels and continuing to invest to drive frequency of that base, it's a really good recipe for a strong long-term traffic growth. Coming up, digital investments have boosted Shake Shack's business. Katie Fogartia shares me they're not done innovating. We want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. This is Bloomberg. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in burning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derogatory integrity. With unmatched reach in resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC From its early days as a kiosk and Manhattan's Madison Square park, Shake Shack's brand has combined simplicity and style. The menu features classic items with a creative twist while the ingredients and service are a significant step up from fast food. The concept was an instant success, but maintaining growth and staying relevant comes with a complex set of pressures. We've come out of the pandemic with a new world and where something that might have been an evolutionary change has been a revolutionary change. We've made changes to the way we eat. We've made changes to the way we operate that might have taken years have been compressed into months and days. The role of CFO in a company like ours that's so dynamically growing, so constantly changing, and focused on digital, is critical. Candy plays such an amazing role there. She's not just moving numbers around. This is not your grandfather's CFO anymore. MUSIC The digital infrastructure, the way we think about things out, is a monster that needs to be fed all day long every day and is always hungry. And you could probably have 150 digital priorities today that all our teams will fight about. Ops wants this, tech wants this, marketing wants this, I want this, Katie wants that. Katie's job is to take all that prioritization, think it through, understand which one is going to have the best return on capital, and which ones have no return on capital, and you still got to do them anyway. That's the reality of the world we live in right now, and it's critical to lead that in the right way. I visited a Manhattan shack with Katie Fogarty. Our first stop inside the restaurant was an ordering kiosk. And on the burger side, you can see the option here for the bourbon bacon jam burger, with salads on top, the avocado bacon burger as well, our beloved smoked shack. The kiosks are an investment in engagement. We just see a gas kind of sit with the menu and really appreciate and understand how they can customize their order for the different add-ons that they have. So we really do believe that this provides them with an even better experience than going to the cash register. What's the payoff? I mean, the cost to put one of these in compared to how much more a customer spends on a kiosk. We do see a very nice lift off of the kiosk. And actually, this is not even a very fancy kiosk technology as an iPad. What has more investment tied to it, it's just the constant innovations that we've had to make the kiosk functionality better and better, and we're driving towards a parody situation where the kiosk and the cash register have exactly the same functionality. And we want the kiosk to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3083,2022-10-15 09:16:08
14858," functionality and we want the kiosks to be able to identify who you are and what you like to order when you come into the shack. Improvements like these take resources. Shade Shacks, General and Administrative Expenses have risen as the companies put capital behind digital initiatives and the changes ripple out from there. As our digital evolution has been underway, we've had to make a number of adjustments to the layout of our current existing shack base and really rethink the flow of the shack that we're building in order to really capitalize and enable and let our digital business thrive. In many Shacks, we've taken out cash registers, we've moved them around. A lot of times it's two or three cash registers that are just taken down to one. We've had to really rethink the way that the flow of our guest journey is in our shack. So one perfect example of it is we put in pick-up shelves here at most of our restaurants. Guests who are looking for that to go experience can come in and pick up the order to go and they don't have to sit there and wait with everybody else who is waiting for their food ready to be made. We are constantly monitoring and identifying ways to be better in the kitchen. And it also goes down to the products and the types of offerings that we have. We never want to have something that is going to overly complicate our team members journey. We don't want to have something that's going to slow us down operationally. So you'll see a lot of our LTOs just really be building our core menu ingredients and allowing our teams to kind of do a little bit different with what we already have. LTO stands for limited time offer. It might be a special shake flavor or partnerships like a recent venture with Distiller Makers Mark. But Shake Shack's core offering is the burger. And it's not just any burger. The company pledges to source premium meat that's ethically raised and costs more even when inflation is not at historic levels. I've heard a lot about the importance of the quality to you guys in terms of ingredients. Doesn't that get expensive especially right now quality beef must be rising in terms of price? I mean we've always used premium ingredients and those premium ingredients that come at a higher price. We always have an eye on the margin. But we know also at the end of the day you're running a very dangerous game if you're trying to reverse engineer into something that you want from a P&L standpoint. The guests might not like it. Shake Shack's standing firm on quality and it's also practicing transparency announcing plans to raise menu prices by 5 to 7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Shake Shack is the best example, the definition of a fantastic value proposition. However, not all customers across this country have, you know, that change in their pocket to pay for that average ticket at lunch or dinner. And I think they're very comfortable with that and I think it's very interesting and very different than what others are doing. I mean it is who they are. They're not trying to escape it. They're not trying to be something they're not. And the fact of the matter is if they picked a different path and it's fine, it would be hard to pivot back. We are serving fresh whole muscle, hormone antibiotic free beef. That is a totally different thing than you're going to eat at nearly all other restaurants, certainly traditional fast food. And you got to pay more for that and you should want to. And when you see things like $10 or $2 for $5, we can't do that because our ingredients cost more than that to bring it to you and you should want to pay more for that. And frankly, who am I to argue? I like that. I might finish this. Coming up, why Shake Shack believes it's got everything to gain by going global. I mean there's so many opportunities for us to add to our licensed business. We see it as a huge, white space opportunity for us. And Katie Fogarty tells me what skills she's relied on while making the transition from Wall Street analyst to CFO. I would say just a lot of grit. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. This is Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space.

14859," Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space, really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. Nearly 90% of Shake Shack locations in the US are company operated. Around the world it's a different story. The business has grown internationally by working with licensed partners to operate restaurants. That's a trend they intend to keep going. Today we have Shake Shack since 16 countries. Everywhere from China to Singapore to the Philippines to London and beyond. We see it as a huge white space opportunity for us. Many restaurant brands struggle to move outside of their own core market in the United States. Perhaps it's something that's very New England and when they try to move outside of the New England area, guest reception is just not there. Or it's a West Coast brand that takes 50 years to bleed across the country. The thing about Shake Shack and the magic about it is this is a company that can sit here with only 200 restaurants in the US today. Open up one in a Tier 2 city in China. And the guest reception for that restaurant is mind blowing. These are some of the largest opens that we've ever had. We have big plans for our licensed business. It's a really asset light, cash accretive business for us. We love it and we love it when our partners overseas make a ton of money. Because they're going to build more restaurants so we're going to all continue to grow. I mean there's so many opportunities for us to add to our licensed business. And certainly I get so many text messages from people traveling the world. If there is a Shake Shack there, guess which one this one is. And if there's not one, why don't you have one here? The first Shake Shack in mainland China opened in 2019 and they're now more than 20. Although the government zero COVID policy is weighed on revenues, the company is committed to expanding its presence. The China is a fascinating business for us. It's one of the most exciting and biggest opportunities Shake Shack has. Over the initial couple of years of the pandemic, they've faired much better than we did here and much better than most places around the world. Today it has been erratic. It's been lockdowns, it's been closures. But here's what's amazing. The resiliency of the Chinese people, our team over there, is unlike anything I've witnessed, it is one of the toughest places to do business in the world. But our brand seems to be really resonating with people over there right now. And I see it as one of the biggest areas of growth we have in Shake Shack. Restaurants haven't been resonating with Wall Street recently. The sector has underperformed the S&P 500 for much of 22. But the industry is historically resilient. Restaurants are undervalued right now. As a person who has been following restaurants since I had hair. I think restaurants are probably the most flexible. It's a ball.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3085,2022-10-15 09:24:47
14860," there. I think restaurants are probably the most flexible and most creative of businesses that we have. The routine and the social engagement happens at restaurants and that's not changing just because we may or may not go into the recession. It just isn't going to change. And so the restaurant stocks will rebound. This industry is the third largest employer, you know, all the population of workers in this country. This is like the fabric of the economy. And the economy will rebound and restaurants stocks will blow up. If you want to trade in and out of Shake Shack, you know, you just may not be the time for you. If you are a believer in the brand of Shake Shack for the long term, like we are and have been, we're going to create tremendous value for our shareholders over time. We've done that. Shareholders should measure us on are we building things for the long term? And if you want to be here for the long term, my sense is Shake Shacks and me good bet. One of Shake Shacks' long term assets is a bright new CFO. Katie Fogarty now has a year of experience under her belt. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What's the opportunity for Shake Shack in the next 10 years that excites you the most? I have to say it is in watching our people grow and develop. I see a very strong growth roadmap here for the company in terms of units and sales potential. But what that really means at the end of the day is that our hourly team members are able to grow a career with us in a way that is unique to Shake Shack and cannot be found at many other restaurant brands. We have a number of people who start off as hourly team members and are now making six figures and have equity because they've grown up through the system and they're paying it forward by training other people to allow them to have such a great career path as well. What's the challenge over the next 10 years that keeps you up at night? It also goes with people. It has been a very challenging staffing environment for the restaurant industry as a whole. It's been well telegraphed that some people have just left the industry all together. We know when we have to high turn over, we're not operating at our best. I do think that there's an amazing opportunity that once the world stabilizes and returns back to normal that we have people considering the restaurant industry as more of an exciting long term career. In terms of your role as CFO, how do you see that or your role with this company changing and developing over the next 10 years? I think that it becomes ever more important to have a great grasp on the insights that are driving the business, on the factors that are driving your business. That's very important for CFO to do but also to collaborate with other business leaders within the company to help cross-pollinate strategies. Whatever I do in a vacuum is not going to be nearly as impactful as our entire executive leadership team coming together and acting on something. I think that that is ever more apparent sitting on this side of the table than it was on the other side as a Wall Street analyst. Speaking of that, what skill or what area of knowledge do you think has helped you the most in your first year as CFO? I would say just a lot of grit. This has been a very challenging industry for sure. I never thought it was going to be easy and it's proved to be quite the learning opportunity. Coming in every day just excited to learn something new and make a difference wherever you can, knowing that I'm sitting here with a team of people growing a company that will potentially have an impact on a number of people's lives going forward. So what advice would you give someone else then who maybe is watching and gets promoted to CFO? What advice would you give to a future CFO? What advice would I give to a future CFO? I guess I would just be get into the details. Super, super deep and really kind of understand and ask a lot of questions. Peel the onion. I think a lot of people just don't go deep enough and don't ask the questions so that you actually cannot, if you're not versed on what's going on, you can't find root cause and you can't try change. So I would say get into the details, have an open mind. It's an incredibly fun job for sure. Working with people who are coming, everybody's aligned here to drive the future of Shake Shack, but everybody comes at it from a different angle. So it's very exciting to work with an amazing team of people. I'm Matt Miller, this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3086,2022-10-15 09:29:05

This is Bloomberg. So as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received, but that I've lived my whole life around. Is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists. Because in the intersection of the debates that go across that wide range of personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with 3 1,000 colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day. And collectively, as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet.

And how much like the consumer is paying them? And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's a kind of flexibility. That's our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to come back at? It's different in different places. Or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms.

That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulence over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, are they just to live or pass somewhere? That's an easy job.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3087,2022-10-15 09:34:27
14862," to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere. That's an easy thing. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. She views her role as much more than just a number-cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise. But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. We need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important, what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem, they share it first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company? Where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. German Post and Postal Service, Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain and E-commerce Solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of E-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. E-commerce is a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company. What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape. But no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectory than anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalization restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage. So we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realized that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global economy,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3088,2022-10-15 09:37:40
14863," Laya, in one province, in one country, is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account, it's the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative, and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also with our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is, fortunately, the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities, and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion Euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person, and that's great, if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening and I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happening more.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3089,2022-10-15 09:42:07
14864," about the level of inventory that is out, you know, in the system, if you will, with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last, that makes pre-mance is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, in the coming slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. You know, we are everywhere in the world, the world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DPDHL is to start some extent recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, look at DPDHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art and logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. Not that little of Kayleigh Limes in New York and Anna Edwards in London. Australia's central bank raises interest rates twice as much as forecast. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brown with some Jonathan Ferro, the RPA, Fronts and Sensor. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain its normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different reality? Bloomberg's surveillance. Be informed. Be prepared. Be ahead of the game. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it and I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship as a consulting firm and I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at a time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Maloney Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025 which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So, mobilisation, connecting the birds.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3090,2022-10-15 09:46:18
14865," which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So, globalization, connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalization, and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say, yes, this is worth the 123 million euros. Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course, there are always debates, doesn't really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labor supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business, but it's going to be less need for labor, for workers. Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they are doing every day. We are over set in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalize the organization. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job, I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone holds. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long term leases and visit growth in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate. Is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-hat where we finally came to the conclusion that this is the right number. This is the right approach. We convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are. We are seen as somebody who really commit. They are not that many companies who have corn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3091,2022-10-15 09:50:43

I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. This is really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now it's had really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Access the financial world on demand.

And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit naive in not thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women. So I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were dox, suits and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every way.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3092,2022-10-15 09:54:44
14867," Expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organisation? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organisation. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. She's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know, what I like about there, she is still, you know, a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person, I think she's a great role model. And a whole that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DPDHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DPDHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges, what keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything, that's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year-plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex. You can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3093,2022-10-15 09:59:26
14868," Curious and ask as many questions as you can? Try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business, and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CEO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs, because you all started with young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it. It's sort of in my blood, but it's really fun starting a business. It's fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, yes, it's fun. And it started how? You started by making, you want Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah, so I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 and for all time bags. And I remember how it made me feel, and I think fashion is fascinating for the mood changing. The confidence boosting aspects. There's a tribal aspects of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of a levergaer, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn actually, and be surrounded by craftsmen who, I mean, making things is important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating. Actually, I mean, I watched the off-shoring. I literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back. To local, we have to. When we're all looking at objectives in terms of carbon, you know, proximity is going to be key. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Searching in vain for solid ground in an escalating Russian war in Ukraine in a troubled global economy and goodness knows in the British Authority's economic management. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Administrator Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy.

14869," They can play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country. The NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won, and must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, there will be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2 percent and core accelerating to 6.6 percent year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm, and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed-Share Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones. We went to bed last night not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted. It called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing, with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone. After the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the Nasdaq down over 3%, and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. And a couple of sort out a wild week in the markets. Welcome now, Joanne Feeney, partner in advisors, capital management, and Lizanne Saunders, chief investment strategist at Chaud Schwab. So welcome back, both of you, to Wall Street Weekend. Let me start with you, Lizanne. What happened this week? I feel like we had hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day. We did see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517. And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying, hedges being taken off, some short covering, and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down and yield yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joanne, a fair amount of noise, I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there. But on Friday, actually, they gave up pretty much everything they got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know, David, I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the U.S. and those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. And another target finally.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3095,2022-10-15 10:08:17
14870," Shrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. The market finally perhaps is digesting that. Listen, there's a lot of talk about. Sorry, go ahead, please. I think Joanne's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the market's almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility, but financial system instability, maybe what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates. And I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digesting to come, particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. It's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be still overs to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And the risks that are out there haven't really abated in many ways. Although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. And I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world. We've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have. And I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded, is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pentound demand on the good side. You saw pent up demand on the services side. That tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. So in some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the worst of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending like Walmart saw? And whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the year.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3096,2022-10-15 10:12:30
14871," because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth, over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And, you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape, as witnessed by what the retailers are saying, there's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that even though the excess savings story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So, I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we all talk about when is the market going to bond them out? When is the bad news bond going to end? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the bulb from here. Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk the global economy is facing, right? It's not just the U.S. and inflation problems globally, right? We have the war in Ukraine, and there are some, maybe, low probability, but very large risks associated with that, and then you have China, and they're continuing zero COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. Now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. The real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world, then now we might find that U.S. companies don't get access to that. So, we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point, and we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Do you know, Anthony and Lizard Sonders will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and up next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. It is crucial and important, and I think we've moved from this attitude from its endulgence a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want to wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3097,2022-10-15 10:16:38
14872," Well, this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for, and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down, as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. It was inventories arising ominously. The housing industry's trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Louis Ruckus here on Wall Street. We've back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now, when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. The number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down, and the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joanne Fini, the advisor's capital management, and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So Joanne, let me come to you. The question is, what do we do with our money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors. It really depends what time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. One of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. One area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's General Mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the four, five, six percent range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Liz Ann, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no, there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is, their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's a narrow gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds right and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market, components of say, big tech and look at it monolithically, make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, lower volatility. It's just kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joe, and what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we're going to have bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now. And they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right, we're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that in a balance strategy with the equity front, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3098,2022-10-15 10:21:11
14873," When you pair that with in a balance strategy with the equity front, you know, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done and it's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Lizanna, you do the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer duration for the income. So my my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four ish percent range. We have suggested you can consider lengthening duration, but I agree with everything that Joanne said to I think there are finally opportunities. You know, we've gone from a from a teen environment. There is no alternative to Tia. There is an alternative and there's income and fixed income again and there are strategies a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield that inflation ever came down. We might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, you know, Lizanna, I wanted to pick up that was exactly the point I was going to make is the challenges that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we, you know, continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances and time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. You know, for example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now, what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash so that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated more than compensated for that cost of inflation or road in the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Lizanna, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth and for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine. What are earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week, they're earnings, which actually we're pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub though is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April May period of time, both for the second half of 2022. And the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S and P earnings growth be exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And that's if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook, if you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Lizanne was saying, the real question, I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious and I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if, when, how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from and I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. So, I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3099,2022-10-15 10:25:35
14874," Not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. Think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple of years, three years, five years. Right now, we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Nansounder. It's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Get up. Let's go. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. We've had sort of a shift in our wean some sort of sideflation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. It's time now to look ahead to next week on Global Wall Street starting with Juliet Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. Chara will dominate the agenda in the week ahead following the party congress. The PBOC sets its one year rate on Monday. Bloomberg economics expects it to remain unchanged. Tuesday we'll see a data blitz with third quarter GDP likely to show only a week recovery and September activity highlighting consumption weakness and the important role public investment is playing in propping up the overall recovery. Wall Street Bank Indonesia is likely to hike by 50 basis points and Australia will probably report moderate jobs growth for September. Now over to Guy Johnson in London. Guy. The UK will remain the centre of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday the big question will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. We also get housing data and then on Friday we get retail sales plus we've got S&P and Moody's both updating their UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week. Food giants to know the Nestle are reporting Tuesday on Wednesday. Wednesday we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers pay attention to that one. And then on Thursday we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Netflix, Tesla and IBM. But also pay close attention to chip equipment maker lamb research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China.

We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Let's head inside. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. We will never break, we will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break, have a wide array of things and the mountains shake. All of us will remain. We will never, no, no, we will never, no. From the world of politics to the world of business, balance of power with David Weston, Newbs and Melisys inside, from and above politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Net Zero emissions. It's a lofty goal, but times are wasting. Just ask John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050, but the reality is, unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons, and so it's very advantage if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not, convincing the public about safety may remain an issue, given high profile accidents like and the downfall",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3101,2022-10-15 10:34:15
14876," get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not convincing the public about safety may remain an issue, given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when, kind of, you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is, what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially opposed the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today, and given the progress of fourth-generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy, potentially, in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving. And we're a 24-7 society, as is the rest of the world. The world is 24-7. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually, with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daiichi, overall worldwide. It's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world. And we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that, Amol. Well, first of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you saw an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline when California took the Senate and offered nuclear reactor offline. Their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions, I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long, it's been used as frankly, a fundraiser a lot and a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand, particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference. Particularly if you think about the rural parts of America, where you're not on the grid, or you're not close to the grid, you can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's first do that question of safety, because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear, or is it technological development, such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3102,2022-10-15 10:38:40
14877," developments such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They may have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being it's not this massive thing, this size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90 percent fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the quote unquote bad stuff to down to 15 percent, let's say. And it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. And there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system, really, that you had the partial meltdown Fukushima Daiichi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with the reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, then, in fact, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate it that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was not even 10 years ago, I guess there were two, four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. And we were very hopeful that those were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles, but you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and make sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them. So that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this, is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in. And that's one of the big challenges that seems to get over overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not, I doubt it. Hopefully, the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted, because we need every penny of it. Certainly, every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former governor, Christine Todd Whitman, now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harb.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3103,2022-10-15 10:42:47
14878," Governor Christine Todd Whitman, now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard. Let's next our Wall Street week on Bloomberg. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will, when burned, only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century.

Visit bso.org-slash-now. Where the music plays on, BSO season sponsor Bank of America. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week, he is Larry Summers of Harvard. Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we waited for this week and boy, they came in, how to expect it. It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure, which is wages. Where you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking. I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Krugman, who are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft, but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. I think we've got to be very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation? How can you tell? What are you looking at right now that tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component, whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3104,2022-10-15 10:46:34
14879," at the so-called median inflation component, whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices. And very crucially, for me, I'm looking at wages, which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything. And all of those are saying that inflation's not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers, Larry, a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain, where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday and to this week. Same time, we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and more importantly, the management of the British economy. Look, I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges. I have said before that people now, I think, understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention, you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition. And I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave, I think, is asking for trouble down the road. So I think we're going to see more tremors, more aftershocks, more problems. At the same time, I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were, this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal. And the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well, exactly, Larry. I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down, IMF this week came out and said, we're looking into a global slow down. At the same time, we have central banks in the development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're going to see similar? Won't be the same, but similar sorts of problems elsewhere, particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places. And places that are more difficult to see, some of the private credit, some of the non-bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. Something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze millions of dollars of finance for green transitions that all these countries. But don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. And I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There are some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IAF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece, also actually speaking with David Maltes, the head of the World Bank, about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3105,2022-10-15 10:51:14
14880," No, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach. And we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital. And instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there's a lack there Larry, often that lack comes for a lack of leadership. We not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House or from that matter at the World Bank. I mean, would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. And I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very, very difficult moment in Africa at a very, very difficult moment in Latin America at a very, very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did was expect to semiconductors and China, the chips market really went down substantially. It took a lot of the tech with it. At a time of so much difficulty globally, what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know, the kind of large-scale cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden Administration announced, I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was pretty across the board effort in something that's very, very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far-reaching implications. Larry, finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on. And that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else, it was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Divvig using mathematics. Careful historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. OK, thank you so much to Larry Summers. Our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it. Let's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3106,2022-10-15 10:55:16
14881," Coming up you can't always get what you want no matter how much you're willing to pay for it. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. However you get your news, this is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. I'm Bloomberg. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. I'm the Bloomberg Crypto. On TV, radio and the web. This is Bloomberg. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear it wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geopel it will potential rise in. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. Often decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation. Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. Finally, one more thought. When money is no object, watch out. They say the one with the most toys wins and let's face it, toys usually cost money. And the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take, for example, Jeff Bezos' new yacht, the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Or Elon Musk agreeing to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. Something most people think is worth a lot less than the price tag, that is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, you know, the deal falls apart and the stock that has been sort of artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who, you know, for the last three months has been saying that Twitter's been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense? Go all in, put all your chips on the table and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race, substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Bady just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. This is the Oasis. Does this look like an Oasis? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those vultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Metz. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off that's going. And then Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base and thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3107,2022-10-15 10:59:46
14882," Hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're gonna get to this great point and have all this momentum behind them and then they then they blow it. That's the match. That's metzing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? That is a great question. Great question. Great question. I get all night. Bloomberg. Top experts. Great questions. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. And if we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never. Hello! Good! How are you? It's so great to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this love getting into crypto? I think that I think was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly, it's when a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Yeah. Other audiences too, it's when it's in the news a lot. And when does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Katie Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase. It became the first female general partner, Adventure firm and recent Horowitz. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3108,2022-10-15 11:04:08
14883," And yours. Katie Han. Katie, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yep. And then it got pretty cold. Hmm. Well look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before. However, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too. Although I am spending less time on Twitter. So maybe that's why as well. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Yeah. Luna, three hours, what's been your takeaways from that? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned Luna and Tara. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career, I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs and the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at 8 to 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I felt like fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law and became a federal prosecutor. And I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases. Being back in the courtroom, being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV, going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs. Hostage taking. Bank robberies. Armed bank robberies. There was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time. 2012. One of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology. That we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first cryptocurrency task force. How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized that the task force was going to be a real problem. And the government realized at the time, it's not possible. Also not desirable. Because Bitcoin is not an entity. It's not a person. Right? It's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash. Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain. Because that's all that existed. That's it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3109,2022-10-15 11:09:08
14884," Let's go shut down the internet. It's not possible. Probably wouldn't be a good idea, either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all it existed then. This is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminality. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step-level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial. But I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, oh, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of the Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents. They knew how to cover their tracks. Had they not used Bitcoin blockchain. So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. MUSIC Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? MUSIC No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in banning them for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day, Bloomberg, your global business authority. So what's the best investment advice you've ever been? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day. And if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns. Compound business returns. Compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very... It's helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or not keeping... But people have conviction or they invest for the... If they invest for the right reasons, they just keep at it. So you became kind of a crypto convert after this. You joined the Board of Coinbase very early on. How did you and Coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank. And I believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges. You know, the government and the crypto industry were never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered. They've been losing share. The valuation of the public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is? And how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah. Well, I think again, a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also, if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3110,2022-10-15 11:13:18
14885," S1, it specifically identifies that and just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider training situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? I think crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most storied venture capital for American Silicon Valley and the United East and East. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horowitz and I met Mark Andreessen and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andreessen Horowitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andreessen Horowitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. Yeah. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, why don't you leave to start a crypto fund of my own? As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andreessen Horowitz. It was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like you're in it. It's excuse very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle and at this, and that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own? Yes. To launch on Ventures, what gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund, it's a crypto growth fund, and I think those are different things. But it's later stage. It might be crypto-publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem, or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. The space has become really competitive, even though you say, you know, crypto's had its kind of ups and downs. The thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of Venture Style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space, and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on Ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even the more traditional Venture capitalists, like entries in Harowitz or Sequoia. They also have crypto funds. Now, well, I think a lot of traditional Venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is, do you live in Brith crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you going to be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3111,2022-10-15 11:17:49
14886," Base full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure and there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year bets. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much for an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have a fish and execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think will still see correct, spoiler, I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layers in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You get VC FOMO and have you not to avoid that. Look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset. Right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-crackth, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct if they're amazing founders. There's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just sucked up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Anyone? Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during the period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a two-year deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened. But we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back great teams when we see them. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. We're falling behind.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3112,2022-10-15 11:22:09
14887,"郡 the market. The markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked about 45% of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. I'm upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. The tiny is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't going along today. It's going to be short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. What about NFTs? And are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. We think of that as like the plumbing. If you think of the fiber optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming due. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. It's not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward, but then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion ECNY wallets. A quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. We're falling behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be no longer the global currency, reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see 285% year-over-year growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures, too. But not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3113,2022-10-15 11:27:04
14888," is that we really do need to not just squash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed. And so to still view it through the ICO lens, when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics. And by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics, too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online, they want digital things, too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces, are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits, and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that, because I will get trolled on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist.

I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes. An unconventional path. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up the main and became ski bump. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families. Rarely were they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Baron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. After my birth, Metsua. I was interested in stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. And my father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3115,2022-10-15 11:34:31
14890," We've never done that, you know, family. And in fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. So I saw that and then he said, well, I had a thousand dollars at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then and show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open a account for you. And so I did research, I would go to this brokerage firm and I would, it was called a McDonald Company or from Cleveland and they were right by Asperic Park High School. So I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks and I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at a tape that hardly moved.

So look, I got a report on this mom with County National Bank and I start reading it and it was around the corner in where I lived in Allenhurst outside of Asperic Park and I told my father why I wanted to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day you just stay the same or win up an eighth and it was printed the 15 stocks in the Asperic Park Press and everybody says the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1000 became $1700. I said, man, there's nothing today I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sidel. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my formative years in middle school and high school in Bucke or Tung Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics. But you were maybe doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started up a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of a off the beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets and I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing is you know, I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel, we're always did it meant we used a fax machine, which you and I of course have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room. So I would have access to real time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I manage. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law, became lawyers and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3116,2022-10-15 11:39:26
14891," college and then you went to University of Michigan Law School and to please your mother father you said I'm going to go to law school but you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No, never. As a matter of fact I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer and I practiced for four days. Four days? I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. So, in the morning of the fifth day I went to see the senior partner and as only a 24 year old could do I looked in and I said I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said okay, there's the door? No, actually what he said is what he's going to do and I said I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Ann Arbor. And so he said why don't you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals and so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bum. What did your family say Nelson we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student you're going to ski I mean that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct they did say that. What did you do you said? I went. I my father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bum and he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood Argon to help them teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood Argon. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck a hundred bucks a week, two weeks that was all I needed. He said fine shave your beard off and do it. I said I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off and after about a week on the job I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Hood Argon, who I did and that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab and then I went to Los Angeles where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did study, I did a scientific work at the Getty and then I set up my own conservation studio where I worked with contemporary artists like Sam Edrige, Sam Francis. And I was running my own business and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio and so I started taking a couple business classes at UCLA and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art where you and I both serve the Lyscher Fellow and I worked in the paper conservation lab there combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening so we said okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break and when my daughter was probably two months old I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door and said hi I want to learn about endowment because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all and he took me in and I started filing and helping organize things and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars so that was one project I worked on.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3117,2022-10-15 11:43:35
14892," I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars. That was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how it's going to be. We have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading in the space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much we're going to pay them, and how much the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. And we're not going to the store doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women. Another trait of great investors that shouldn't surprise you is they all tend to have a high degree of intelligence, many excelled academically. But true success as Mary Erdo's, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset and Wealth Management, points out, comes from training and continuing to educate oneself. So training on Wall Street, but specifically in Wealth Management, is a very, very long process. We have 2200 analysts starting today and they're going to be working through the summer. We have 3600 analysts across JP Morgan Chase that will start at the very end in the September time period for their full time role. And we work very hard to go through in-depth training and then to work through which ones actually are good at stock investing, which ones are good at M&A transactions, which ones are good at helping people understand things in a more simplistic matter. That's a two to three year training program. But that's pretty fast. If you think 10,000 hours is about what you need to master any subject. If someone comes in and has a regular, you know, eight hour a day job, five days a week, it's going to take you about five years to have a base level mastery. On Wall Street, it's more like 12 hours a day, six days a week, that cuts you down to about two and a half years before you become mastered in something. Once they've got that under their belt, they can then join a team. And if they've been successful going through the analyst program, joining a team, then the team will work through how that works. But it is a constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers is.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3118,2022-10-15 11:47:36
14893," constant education each and every day. Every morning we start with an eight o'clock meeting and I call it like a mini university. And it's not just about what you've read in the newspapers as to what happened overnight. It's about understanding how all of those components fit together in a client's portfolio and then what might be right for you would be different than somebody else. And you're synthesizing all that information every morning and then you're going out and you're figuring out how to apply it to each situation. Dawn Fitzpatrick, the investment chief for George Soros, is of a similar mindset to Urdos. For her, the constant pursuit of new ideas and new voices keep her ahead of the game. So I read a lot. You know, in the morning, I'll skim through two or three different papers. During my days, I'm meeting with a lot of smart investors and smart people running companies. You learn a lot from there. I talk to peers, but I think part of the trick of this big business is being able to really aggregate and assimilate information. And one of the other tricks of this industry is trying to find sources of information that are different than the other people in the business because you don't want to get crowd thinking. I think that happens a lot in this business. Everyone's talking to the same people. And a view becomes consensus that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip throw through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes, and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the great-grade shopping center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four. So it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matredee. Because we were this tiny little business. And I was learning it firsthand. Now, one of the most famous things in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also, you might say it's local, local, local. Because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about their value of real estate in Europe or in Asia? And how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years. And you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say, though, that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouse is back in 2010. And we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up. And we started buying more in the US. It wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing is going to happen in Canada. It's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate. Plus, you travel a lot. Like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job. But they have teams around the world on the ground. And we're local in those markets. And I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai, the way we have, flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. And we are wrong a lot of the time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3119,2022-10-15 11:52:24

One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest wins come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you're leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Venaud Kostler. Each top-end venture firm has its own bar. It has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. Then the top-tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top-tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. After you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of this is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm. If it is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. This is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, if another one of these top-end firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top-end firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. In one of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angel List, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. Every once in a while, you get these outliers. It's fundamentally a game of outliers. The money is made on the aberrations. You want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now, a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point, things settle down. Do you worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised, or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit, and is that a worry for you? It's a cyclical business, for sure. It has a history of boom-buss cycles, basically, just like any other sector of the economy. That said, I guess I would say, we do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not-macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. If you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods, but also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods. They're pros and cons of those periods. It's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. Our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through, and basically bet on these micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk, higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively in",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3120,2022-10-15 11:56:18

Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues and the following categories. Protect and restore nature, clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour, we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you were all giving our Earthshot finalists the next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organizations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reasons to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city, and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. Well, my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement. I also acknowledge that",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3181,2022-10-15 12:05:10
14896," e reach their full potential with peace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I'll tear our New Zealand a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold a world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganui the sky, father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Kaitiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, kō ahō te tāau kō te tāau kō ahō I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now I've seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that it is a source of challenge, as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up. But because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is alive. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill and we just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem, or shrug it off for future generations to address. We're all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere. Where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities. Where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity. Where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3182,2022-10-15 12:08:57
14897," your renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent, and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by hope, not fear, by optimism, not despair. Because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate, to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system-changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prizes call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. This is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. Welcome back to the best of the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of states to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well, amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah, it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. When I last went through Europe, people were the leaders were all saying, hey, give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said, hey, in five years, you're going to be able to call them up. And they were like, no, we'd like it. No. It's a year alone. OK, that has your planning permission regime and all the planning for that future grid. Seeds, typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields, is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3183,2022-10-15 12:13:12
14898," It's about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. We've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded at about a billion a year. It's if people care at all about adaptation, that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean, there won't be anything close to the impact of climate-related seeds, climate-related maize, rice, wheat, sort of a millet. And thank goodness, because of human genetics, we know how to do the editing. Thank goodness, because of AI, we know how to find the alleles, because of drones, we can measure stuff in the field. So there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at full speed. The timing is very tricky here. The warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions. There's a lag in this system. It's about a 20-year lag. So you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content. So when you get to zero, it's not like 2051, take my air conditioner away. No, it starts quite a bit later. And so you have to look at what the peak is, and you can't just plan for, okay, 2030, 2030's where your main production in central Africa's down 25%, by 2050, it's down 70%. And you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to Sorghum. Now Sorghum productivity is super low. So we'll get people to do better maize for these next 15 years, and then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods in Pakistan, and nobody expected that. But if the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disaffirmary recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing, and what is food aid? If climate's causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money, is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going up. That's a system that's about 6 1.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger. But the demand for that piece, which is the acute half a Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is a- We still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires. There are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy? You mean everything to do with energy? You mean generation of energy? You mean batteries? You mean transport? You mean all of the new? And there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah, so every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on past and your cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're further still long. About 4%.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3184,2022-10-15 12:18:12
14899," And so the focus on the easiest third, you know, now 4% of new cars are electric, you know, so that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, you know, some people would say 100%, other people might say 70 to 80%. You know, the amount you have to build were, you know, not within a factor of five of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. cement, you know, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, you know, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium, carbonate, heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes a man. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron, there's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a dead industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity and some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electricity steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. That's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we tried to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid, never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Bloomberg. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely. So there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that. And they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates. After decades of stagnation, Japan's leaders are forging a more innovative and sustainable path forward to revitalize the nation.

14900," The annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and here's what they have to say. This is the earth shot decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy, some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today and our earth shot is, as Paddy said, 30 by 30. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. This will be this protected area, as we produce a spillover that will exceed the foregone catch. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. We know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. It is a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. That is the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years. That is where the earth shot is pretty crazy. In the next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that can be done? I am optimistic, there is no choice. I have seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold and if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult, it will take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we have all the essentials right here in this room. What is the challenge? It is the speed, scale and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. That is exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. That means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. While some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030 we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030 we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We need more nature in cities, exactly. Exactly, right. So we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy, which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is we want to enable over 500 cities-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3186,2022-10-15 12:26:19
14901," Data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as of course preserving and restoring nature And so one of the goals that we've said is we want to enable over 500 cities around the world I know we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a giga ton of carbon emissions by 2030 And so that's through data tools in sites whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieved by 2030 Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the grouch convention But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing helping Oh You've got me Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle Together everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste and that includes even you Me? Sorry, my guy. I got to get going to that convention but just between us. Yes. I do have a recycling bin right next to my can But no, I think it out okay. It'll ruin my image But my father believed in the power of the idea and over time the vision the purpose the courage it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges Not because they're easy but because they're hard President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute That it would require innovation creativity teamwork commitment and faith and that world would be better because of it The earth shot prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale To tackle the most pressing challenge we now face repairing the planet My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's earth shot prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston A city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice and the fight against climate change We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on the planet And that's all from the earth shot prize innovation summit you can find complete coverage of the event including full interviews and articles on blooper.com I'm Francing Lackwap from New York and this is Blooper What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common?

Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's derrige world integrity. With unmatched reach and resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. Thanks. Welcome, everybody. Welcome everybody to the inaugural NIL Summit and NIL Awards. In July 2022 Atlanta hosted what might sound like a boring legal seminar. A conference on the new rules around name, image and likeness in sports. But far from dry and academic, the first annual NIL Summit was in fact a flashy star-studded event put on at the College Football Hall of Fame. And Mingling amid the biggest current and former names in sports and media, there was a crucial cohort. The player is poised to redefine what it means to be a modern college athlete. And the winner of male athlete of the year goes to Chase Griffin. Among those up-and-comers, UCLA's Chase Griffin. The UCLA quarterback is among the students becoming as well known for making deals as making plays. And even in that group, Chase stands out. My name is Chase Griffin. What's up everyone? It's Chase Griffin. It's your favorite quarterbacks, favorite quarterback, Chase Griffin. When you look at it as an empowerment equity opportunity, it's really been unmatched in the sports world for any point in time since Title IX. Better a scope. After hardly a full year of name image and likeness deals being the reality, he already has more than 20 deals with major brands, venture and charitable groups. All the while bouncing, graduating undergrad in just two years and fighting for playing time on the field. Chase Griffin out of the gun. We are joined by UCLA quarterback Chase Griffin. Not just UCLA quarterback, but name image like this superstar. I am sited for this one. This kid could actually be the president of the United States someday. This isn't the starting quarterback for UCLA. He's not even the backup quarterback. But back on campus in LA, his nickname is president Chase. And after spending a couple days talking about his approach to business, sports and equality, it's not shocking to think he might someday hold that office. His level of focus and maturity at this stage, I only wish I had. If you want to buy stock in human being, buy stock in Chase Griffin. When it comes to building generational wealth, it's not about the money that you make in college. I'm very excited that I made the amount of money that I made last year. I am even ten times more excited that I know how to make that money. Summer on any college campus is mostly for the athlete to run lighter, but still regimented individuals. The tendon classes working out, a little bit of hanging out, and then more working out on their own time. Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup. I'll be at an impatient one.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3188,2022-10-15 12:35:07
14903," Chase is no exception. The 21 year old is a backup, albeit an impatient one. In the Topsy-Turvy past couple of seasons dotted with fan-less games and COVID protocols, he's been able to start three games for the Bruins. Griffin, gonna throw to the end zone! Why open again and touch down! UCLA! Beating Arizona and narrowly losing to both Stanford and Oregon. That was inches away from Chase Griffin and UCLA being in full-fledged comeback mode. For Chase, UCLA felt like destiny. He was born just a few miles away before his family moved to Texas when he was a toddler. But beyond being a sort of homecoming, the school's history of athlete activism was a massive draw. I always expected from myself to have some sort of impact that was beneficial for more people than I interact with on a daily basis. And choosing UCLA, a lot of that went into me seeing myself as someone who reflected the same want to make things better, that so many of the people that UCLA prides itself upon being the home for have done in the past. The legacies of former UCLA grades like Arthur Ash, Jackie Robinson, Karim Abdul-Jabbar and Jackie Joyner Kursi have had a wide-ranging impact on society well beyond the Westwood campus. Chase reveres these people, but he's perhaps most keenly aware of the activism of a more recent ruin alum, the basketball player at O'Bannon. At O'Bannon, who was an ace-meth player of the year National Champ, UCLA sports legend is also a legal hero. I think NIO could be the next installment where we look back in 30, 40, 50 years and God willing if we give him the roses he deserves, we add at O'Bannon to that list of UCLA grades. O'Bannon, who played at UCLA from 91 to 95, initiated a lawsuit that's widely credited for finally opening up the possibility of college athletes being paid for use of their name, image and lightness. He sued the NCAA and video game publisher EA for anti-trust violations, arguing that athletes should be entitled to financial compensation when schools used their lightness for game. In 2014, a judge ruled in his favor. And then on an episode of the shop surrounded by O'Bannon, Diana Tarrassi and LeBron James, California governor Gavin Newsom signed the first ultimately successful legislation to allow athletes to receive endorsement deals. The Fair Pay to Play Act led other states to follow suit and ultimately led the NCAA in 2021 to relent, seemingly reluctantly. NIO payments were officially allowed as of July 1st 2021. Today is the last day where name, image and lightness laws will not be on the books and kids will not be if you will not allowed to make money off of their name, image and lightness. Making money from Jersey sales and endorsement deals is a way for players to share in the massively lucrative world of college athletics. This NIO thing is the wild, wild west. The NIO change felt like many things that happened very slowly and then it happened very fast. And I wonder for you having contemplated that maybe this was coming at some point, how prepared were you, what was your mindset when the switch flipped? Right. I mean, I still think everyone's trying to get prepared for the industry. It's still sort of like a wild, wild west. I wasn't really expecting anything. I was more just thinking about honestly getting ready for that season and capitalizing on everything that was happening. When NIO hit and it turned out I had action, I was like, oh, okay, well after this degree deal, it was fantastic. I was like, okay, I'll see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. Now I've seen…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3189,2022-10-15 12:39:32
14904," I was like, okay, I see how I can be a staple in this game and I see how I can get better over time. That's why I teamed up with my friends at Shell. And then Shell did hit and then boosted my whole deal hit. And then you keep on building clear code. Like you keep on building and you get better in the meetings. And most of all, you start seeing where your value can be best placed in these new opportunities. The headlines and storylines in the aftermath of the NIL change introduced visions of instant millionaires strolling campuses across the nation. You might think the NIL athlete of the year lives in Splendor or at least in one of those athletic palaces that put most of our coach dorms to shame. Well, it's all relative to chase. All right Jason. So here we are world headquarters. Yep, this is where it all happens. So there's the kitchen right here. I actually really enjoy cooking. Oh yeah. Yeah, this gas oven gets really hot really fast. I make pizzas in there. This is the best appliance since dog phone. If I could put anything in there, I need to do these dishes right here. So no trappings of success yet. More a pretty average college dorm room. And so there's a well used PS4 and of course the requisite Godfather poster. It's a far cry from the lifestyle seen in some local news reports for NIL athletes during this first year. Bejohn Robinson made headlines with an NIL deal with Lamborghini Austin. Lamborghini's tend to make more headlines than Muhammad Ali are Bruce Lee pictures. Some athletes are living in mansions driving Lamborghinis. As far as I know you're doing either of those things. I see where you're living right here. It is with all to respect not a mansion. How much of that is a conscious choice and what does it say about sort of your approach to this? Right. I mean first off, I look at this is like is my own room a guy? Everything I need. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with living below my means. I think it's important to remember that the volume of financial gain is completely overstated. That's what it y'all is following the media. And someone hears about a 5 million or 10 million dollar deal. You've got to report it. Like, oh my goodness people are going to read this. Hey, I'd count two things. How many kids are even getting these deals? And then for the kids that do get it, how much of that is in liquor cash? How much of it is in assets? If you pay for a $2 million house out here in LA for a kid to stay in the college, that's great. But as soon as they're graduated, they're not going to have that $2 million house. I say the same thing, you know, for the kids who are driving around in Lamborghini's and stuff like that. That's awesome. Like, that's super dope. And I know some of those kids. But, you know, someone paying for your lease is different than someone actually giving you the value of that lease every single month. You're investing in it, saving it for a long time, etc. I say all that just to mention that product deals and stuff like that are overhyped by the media. And they also can land kids in some trouble if they're not paying taxes on it. That's one of the distinctly unsexy and easy to overlook elements of the new rules. Even if an athlete's not getting cold hard cash from a deal, the value of any products given are subject to state and federal taxes. So suddenly, what a player sees as free gear in return for some social media posts actually equals taxable income. And that requires the same forms you'd fill out as an independent contractor getting a check. I made a fair amount in NIO deals and I invested all of it. In my opinion, NIO is great. Doing all this is great. Making money now is great. But the most valuable thing I've gotten from all of this is, in the fact, I'll always know how to make money off of myself. All told, Chase has done more than 20 deals with major brands like Degree, Shell, and Boost Mobile. Along with venture-stage companies including Discord, Duffle, and Creative Juice. He's also made a point to work with charities like the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, where he's already raised funds for almost 60,000 meals. It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure.

14905," For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information.

I'll show you how you're doing. I'm doing well. I'm turning on my camera right now. You have no worries. This is an average NIL deal, a brand approaches an athlete who can help spread their message to a demographic they believe the athlete can help reach. In this case, direct TV is looking to market their NFL Sunday ticket to college students. If it be two posts, one post late August and one post on the first week of September, and the compensation would be 1200 per post, so it would be 400 total. Are they video posts or are they picking captions? They can be either. It's up to you guys. That was pretty good. 400 above, but they had originally asked. That's a win. So yeah, I mean, at this point after I do a Zoom or something like that, I had to chill out, go back to land down if I was watching a movie or something, or go to YouTube to start liking for more samples. This is presidential change. It's a pretty simple interaction for Chase and for direct TV, negotiated over a couple of emails and Zoom calls, and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs.

14906," and papered with a contract Chase will have his dad look over before he signs. And Chase, who's made himself as much of a student of the new NIL marketplace as he has a public policy at UCLA, says he understands why it's working. A brand ambassador with an athlete is more attractive to these brands announced rather than a terminal investment than even a post by a famous actor. If there's any place to learn that sports are deep in the hearts of Americans, it's on a high school football field in Texas. Friday night lights in the Lone Star State might be the gridiron equivalent of Frank Sinatra's New York City. Making it there needs your something special. Chase Griffin quarterback class 19, Hado, Texas. And Chase didn't just make it, he excelled. Let's talk about some of the top quarterbacks in the state. And when you look at that list at the top of it, you got to talk about Chase Griffin. I was lucky to play three years as a quarterback for Hado High School, which is a one horse town. We'd have great success. And so the town really shut down and came out and supported us every Friday night. Chase, right there. He's right open if he can catch it. He does touch it on the post. Chase, one word to describe that finish that game. God, that's it. Coming from a town like that where football is so prioritized, it has its pros and cons, but I think on the pros side, I learned how to win, how to get better. And most importantly, what it's like to build a team where everyone gets better. Emulating his UCLA alumni like Robinson, Jorner Cursey and Abdel Jabar, Chase is looking at the impact NIL will have not just for him, but the athletes that will follow. When the predecessors who have come before you have changed the world and made life better for everyone today, you can't help but ask yourself how the actions that you're taking now and the companies and brands and the NIL space that you work with are all cumulatively building something greater than any of us could foresee. I've actually, I've never moderated, so this will be my first time. It should be fun. I know my handwriting's terrible. The last day the conference chase was asked to co-moderate a panel with Monique Nelson, the CEO for UNI World Group. All right, I'm excited to be here. UNI World Group is one of the longest standing multicultural advertising and marketing agencies in the United States. The firm works with brands like Ford, Home Depot, and Johnson and Johnson to help reach the Black and Brown communities, and they have big ambitions in NIL. For UNI World Group, the idea of this was pretty epic in that because we serve the undervalued, overlooked, and the underserved, we knew that this particular group of people would fall into that category. And we plan on being the premier practice for NIL athletes that are looking to do purpose-driven, media advertising, community-level engagement work. UWG launched a program called the NIL to help Black student athletes partner with major brands, but to help them understand how to do that, they brought on Chase to serve as a student-athlete executive in residence. For me, I do nothing without tremendous amounts of data for all of our clients. I really wanted to be thoughtful about this practice being very athlete-centric. If I were to build it or anyone on my team were to build it, it would not have the athlete at the core. When you're 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, the best way to have credibility is confidence, and the only way for confidence to be authentic. I'm actually learning on the job. I'm learning about the brand side of NIL, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black student athletes in the NIL world.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3192,2022-10-15 12:52:27
14907," of NIO, but I'm also trying to make sure that empowerment equity is built in, especially for Black student athletes in the NIO world. ROI, return on investment. Both Chase and UWG see NIO deals as something much more than making money for students. It's also a potential investment in a community long overlooked. Think we're getting ready to stop boxes, kind of feed the people of L.A. A piece of each of Chase's NIO deals go to his belief brand campaign, which has raised more than $13,000 for meals for the L.A. Food Bank backpack program. But athletes giving back is only one side. I'm here with legal zoom to give you five tips on the NIO game plan. UWG and Chase believe having brands investing in the athletes, especially athletes of color, can be a force multiplier for these historically marginalized communities. When you look at the revenue jet and rating sports for the Bombass, 88% of those athletes are Black. So when you're doing stuff to empower student athletes in the NIO space, you're also helping to deliver on your promise. Now student athletes are not the only ones who should receive this by any means. But statistically by doing that, you're going to be delivering on your mission. Additionally, student athletes on average come from lower levels of income. So you're also delivering on that promise. And a lot of these student athletes are first generation, their first gen college students. Some of them first gen high school diploma. Some of them first time receiving the amount of money that they receive in their families. This has been a wild first year in NIO. We all knew that there would be bags of cash around, right? There's always been bags of cash. There's cash everywhere. What we know is that that's not sustainable. We know that athletics has an expiration date on it. So for us, inclusion ultimately means this is just a part of you. It is a tremendous part of you and we're going to celebrate that part of you. But we also know that you're bigger than that. So we want to empower you to live past your expiration date for this part of your life. And quite honestly have equity in everything that you have poured yourself into as an NIO athlete. It may still be the Wild West days for the NIO industry. But in the first year, about a billion dollars in business was done with NCAA athletes. For the early leaders in the NIO space like Chase, they're striking a precedent for athletes that follow them. And that's important because collegiate athletes don't have that much time to profit. Only an estimated 2% of NCAA athletes go on to the pros. Even the hardest working are often limited by things they can't control. For Chase, it's been his height. I'm 5'10 now in high school after my sophomore year went up through for 3000 yards. I was probably like 5'6"", 5'5"". I mean, I get arguably say I'm one of the best in the history of Texas high school football. But you know, I've gone through the height test where they'll call you out of class, shake your hand, look at you up and down. And be like, nice to meet you, you go back to class. It's a sad but timeless story for student athletes. And for Chase, his story is something he's not shyed away from. But embraced when it comes to his NIO deals. I'm frequently the smallest person on the football field, but I always strive to be the most impactful. My middle school coach told me that I would never play in high school. Chase's deals with degrees breaking limits team and clear covers inspired underdogs, allowed him to capitalize financially from football, even the last season he never saw the field for UCLA. I play football because I love the game. I play the football because I'm a good competitor. I love to compete and I play football because I'm good at it. At the end of the day, I don't play football for my livelihood, which is important to remember when it comes down to identity. I myself chase Griffin as long as I'm that. I got something in this world. As he moves into the news.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3193,2022-10-15 12:56:49
14908," I'm that I got something in this world. As he moves into the new season and focuses more on football than business, Chase doesn't see much of a differentiation between the two in terms of his mindset. I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't playing football in five years and it was running in Fortune 500 company, but also when it be surprised if I was went in to Super Bowl five, ten years from now. And either way, I'm going to keep on working at the tools that would align myself and my future with both. At the end of the day, you're always going to have yourself. If you can make profit off of yourself and know where you add value in any world you're in, you'll be able to adapt and find ways to generate wealth for yourself. Part of what I love about business is you get to build things from nothing. I don't have any investors. All this is all money in. This is me just building. It's pretty much full service shadow banking with nobody in charge. At some point you had to fight for the trademark for the red soul. Is that stressful? Very stressful. Especially, you know, we are a small company in a way and you have to fight people who have those huge companies who put you 27 lawyers on your back for something which is yours is very stressful. I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is less than in a way bad or good. Once it's done, it's done and you're sort of happy. I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely avoided, but it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful? I'm actually so big. No, no. When I started the company I wanted to have a shop in Paris which is my hometown and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say actually I still make pretty shoes for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would have been so successful without the red soul? I think the red soul definitely, of course, participates to my work but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to, yeah. Watch Bloomberg's surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it.

14909," We will never break. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water roses and the mountains shake. All of who will remain? We will never. No, no. We will never. No. This is my kitchen table and also my filing system. Over much of the past three decades, I've been an investor. The highest calling of mankind I've often thought was private equity. And then I've started interviewing. I watch your interviews because I know how to do something. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. I didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell. And how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world, is that right? In recent decades, one of the most important figures in Wall Street has been John Mack. He led Morgan Stanley for many years and led it through the financial crisis of 2007-2008. John rose from modest circumstance in the North Carolina to become a dominant figure on Wall Street for quite some time. I sat down with John recently to discuss his life story and also what he sees as the future of Wall Street. So you spent more than 50 years on Wall Street and probably the most difficult time was during this 2007-2008 recession where Morgan Stanley came close to going under. Was that the most difficult time of your career? No question about it. I mean, we were on the brink of going out of business. And you thought you had a good cash reserve for a while, but then all of a sudden people started pulling cash out. Your cash reserves went down. How close did you come to actually going bankrupt? Well, we were very close, David, into the point that Tim Geithner, at the Fed, was trying to get us to sell to Jamie Diamond at the time. And he kept saying, that's what I want you to do. So I called Jamie and I said, look, Geithner's all over me. He says you'll buy the firm. He said, I don't want your firm. I said, well, go tell Geithner that. And he said, John, if he forced me to do it, I wouldn't pay you $2 a share. So that made it easy on me. I was not going to listen to them. And as a result, we called our board in and we're thinking we're going to go out of business. At one point, you're on a phone call with Ben Bernacky, the chairman of the Fed, Hank Paulson, Secretary of Treasury, and Tim Geithner, the head of the New York Fed. And they say you should file for bankruptcy. And you slammed the phone down on them. Was that easy to do? For me, it was easy to do. I mean, thank God I left out some four letter words. I said, I'll take the firm down first and I hung up on it. Okay. I can't tell you why I did it because I'm my gut. It was the wrong thing to do. So now, after your retirement, you decided to write a book. It's a very good book. I read a post and all in about your life story. So how hard is it to sit down and write about your life and go through the good and the bad things that take you along with a long time to do this? And do you ever say, why did I agree to do this? No. No. I enjoy sitting down and working with the person who works on the book. Look, I have a lot of memories and a lot of things that I did that in talking with him, it came up of other things that I had done. So I enjoyed it. It was, I got along really well with my writer and Linda Coleman was just terrific. And we had fun doing it. So I enjoyed doing the book. So at the end of the book, you say something that I found to be surprising. You talked about the fact that you've recently been diagnosed with some cognitive impairment, which you say could lead to Alzheimer's. Correct.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3195,2022-10-15 13:05:34
14910," I think that I found to be surprising. You talked about the fact that you've recently been diagnosed with some cognitive impairment, which you say could lead to Alzheimer's. Right. And why did you put that in the book? You didn't need to put that in. No, I didn't. Christian, I talked about it. And she said, look, John, you're always up front with people. You're writing this book. Tell people the truth. Tell them you're having some issues. So we talked about it, and I agree that it's the right thing to do. I mean, I didn't put it in there for sympathy. I didn't put it in there for, you know, come over and give me a hug. I just think my personality has been up front. I tell people what's going on. I did that when I ran Morgan Stanley. I did it at Credit Suisse, even though Suisse didn't like me very much for doing it. I did it at Credit Suisse. That's who I am. I'm up front. I tell people what's going on. Look, it happens. You say that maybe you thought it came from your football injuries, or maybe you fell off an ATV. Right. But in hindsight, is it more of a genetic kind of thing do you think, or does the doctors don't really know? Well, the doctors don't know it's genetic. I mean, my mother did have Alzheimer's. I just think you need information. Look, I hope my cognitive skills last a long time, but life's life and just live it. And I don't think trying to hide things. You know, if you and I didn't know each other like we know each other, go out to dinner, I don't want you to say, John, you just told me that three minutes ago. I want to put a little warning out there, you know, give me a break. I may repeat myself. And I cover myself by saying I may have already told you this. Now, Christie is your wife of more than 50 years as well? 49 years. 49 years. Okay. So, where did you meet her? I met her through Charlie Rose. So Charlie Rose and I were at Duke University. He was a couple of years ahead of me. And he had moved in New York and I was in New York working at Smith Barney at the time. And he called me up and said, you know, my wife's sister's coming up. We'd like you to take her out. I thought about it a little bit and got a date for Friday night and called him back and said, okay, we'll go out Saturday night. And I got to their apartment on 96th Street. Mary was a beautiful woman. And Christie walked in and took my breath away. Not only beautiful, but had a great smile. She was very warm, very friendly. If it wasn't love at first sight, it was pretty close. Let's talk about your background. So you grew up in North Carolina, but your grandfather immigrated from Lebanon, is that right? But why did you go to North Carolina? Was there a big Lebanese community there? Or did he intend to go to another place? There was a big Lebanese community in South Carolina. And he was going to go to Marion, South Carolina when he got off Ellis Island and he ended up in Marion, North Carolina. He stayed the night in the train depot. No one came to pick him up. So finally, the conductors said, get on the, pull him on the train and took him to Charlotte, North Carolina on that train. And there was a Arabic family around a coffee shop at the train station. And they talked about the mix up. They gave him a job, he started washing dishes, then it became a peddler. Then he went back and got the rest of his family. And they had made enough money to get a wagon. And they went in the countryside selling cloth, sewing materials, shoes, stuff like that. And then that evolved into John Mackinson's, John Mack was my grandfather's name. And it was a clothing department store. My father, who was an entrepreneur, decided he wanted to be totally on his own. And he started wholesale grocery business. And so they wanted you to go in that business at some point? I don't think my father did. My mother was a very strong force. She only wanted to be a doctor. And I really didn't want to be a doctor. My father was laid back and my mother was really aggressive. It was a great combination. So you were a high school football star? Well, I don't know about a star, but I was a good football player. I thought you were all state. That was pretty good. All right, all state. You've done your homework. So all states, so you get a scholarship at Duke University to play football. And what happened to your career at Duke? Well, I thought it was a good football player, so I got to Duke. They had some great players. And I thought I was a good football player. I thought I was a good football player.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3196,2022-10-15 13:10:09
14911," You get a scholarship at Duke University, to play football, and what happened to your career at Duke? Well, I thought it was a good football player to I got to Duke. They have some great players. And then in my sophomore year, I was a red shirt for one year. Then I was on like the second team, but I broke C6 in my neck. I cracked it. And what happened every time I would tackle someone, my left arm, inside would go dead. So Frank Bassett, who's one of the orthopedic surgeons, who used to be at Duke, called the AD and said, this young man's football career is over. He has a bonafide injury. He cannot play football any longer. So that ended my football career. But once you're on scholarship, I still had to work there. So I was a manager, you know, getting towels and setting up trips when I go play, you know, one of the teams in Florida or one of the teams in the Big Ten. So when you graduated, did you say, I want to go to Wall Street and be the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Now, when I graduated, I need one course to finish Duke University. My scholarship had expired. So I got a job in a local brokerage firm called First Securities in North Carolina. So that got me involved in the securities business. And there was a lady there named Fannie Mitchell. And maybe you remember, she ran the job placement office at Duke University. So when the recruiters would come down, she would say, there's one guy you got to meet. It's John May. And I would meet these recruiters and got a number of job offers. And then I decided that I liked the securities business. Smith Barney wanted to open an office at that time in Atlanta. They offered me a job. I was a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can be fine, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will wind burn only produced water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. She went to Smith Barney. What did you do there? I was a regular investment member. Exactly. We started out in a training class and I got my brokerage license. I was approached by the head of the municipal bond division. Why don't you come into the bond business? I didn't want to go down to open an office in Atlanta or down in Florida. I took that job. I got into the bond business and I was a trader on the bond desk of the municipal's and then at some point that led Smith Barney of getting into the corporate bond market and I transitioned over to corporate bonds. Then from there they told me they would put me on commission which they never did. I got approached by a small boutique firm called Smithers which was really known for their bond acumen and their bond business. I went over and became a salesman doing corporate securities, corporate bonds at Smithers and companies. It would be a good trader. You have to be pretty quick in your head with numbers to make sure you get the numbers right. Is that true or are you really good at that? No, that is true but I think as a salesman much more so than a trader, that business is a commodity business without relationships. If you can build a relationship with your clients where they trust you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3197,2022-10-15 13:14:14
14912," than a trader, that business is a commodity business about relationships. So if you can build a relationship with your clients where they trust you and they go to you when they have business to do, that's how you become successful. Hey, so how did Morgan Stanley hear of you and say you should join what was then considered a white shoe firm and probably hadn't hired a lot of Lebanese backed traders before, right? That's a good story. So I met with Dick Fisher who was running that initiative to build a secondary bond business. And we went back and forth and I said, I'm flattered that you would all have your job. But I don't believe a Lebanese heritage from North Carolina who went to Duke University has a chance at making it Morgan Stanley. And he said, well, you're wrong. And if you think you come over here and you're right when you quit our resign, I'm telling you you're wrong. This is a meritocracy and you should join us. It convinced me. So in those days Morgan Stanley was a private partnership, not a public company. Correct. And it was a company that basically underwrote, let's say AT&T bonds, but it didn't actually go out and sell them. It was priceless. Price them and other people would sell them. Right. So Morgan Stanley said, we're now gonna change that and you became a trader for Morgan Stanley. Do I became a salesman at Morgan Stanley? That's what they need. So you did that for a while and then at some point, people give you more authority and you get to be in management. Did you want to be in management or do you like to be a trader or salesman? No, I like success. So I thought the right way to go is managing, being a manager and that's what I wanted to do. And whether there's a lot of disagreement or any good or not very good, I liked it. And I thought I was pretty good at it. So you rose up and you ultimately are offered the position of being the CEO of Morgan Stanley. Well, yeah, eventually, but there were a lot of blocks along the way to do that. But then all of a sudden, you decided you needed to do a merger with Dean Witter. Right. And why did you need to do that? Well, Dean Witter was owned by Sears and they had decided to spin it off. And we had Morgan Stanley got the order from Sears to do this transaction to raise money in an equity transaction. So when we met with Phil Purcell and talked about all their salesman, their branch offices, it became apparent to me and also to Dick Fisher that this is the way to really build a franchise because distribution is going to be more and more important and to have a connection with retail clients would be important. And that's how we made the decision. And there was push back in the firm. But with Parker Gilbert and Dick Fisher's leadership, we were able to convince the partners. This is the right thing to do and we did it. So your firm was a leading Wall Street firm. You could argue Dean Witter was a so-called Main Street firm. Correct. And putting the two together had never been done like that before. Correct. And how did you negotiate who was going to be the CEO? Well, at that time, Dean Witter owned Discover Card. So their market cap was dramatically larger than ours. So we based it on market cap. And they had a much larger market cap to do the deal. Purcell wanted to be in charge. That was one of the prerequisites to do the deal. He'd be the CEO. And I'd be the president of the firm and we did that deal. All right. She did that deal. And being president under somebody else was a step back. You could argue that it's a bigger firm. How long did that last? David, that's a good question. I know it didn't last too long. Ultimately, you said I've had enough of this. And you didn't like his style. And you write about that in your book. But you ultimately said, OK, I'm out of here. So unemployed. And you tell your wife, guess what? Your husband's unemployed. No, my wife is so supportive. I got to tell her anything. And she's on my side. It was great. I ended up at one point going to a hedge fund and work with Art Sandberg. And I did that for a while. But I was really flexible. And I think they call them the grumpy old men who went after the existing management at Morgan Stanley and felt like they were looted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3198,2022-10-15 13:18:40
14913," I think they call them the Grumpy Old Men who went after the existing management at Morgan Stanley and felt like they were losing their edge and also their reputation as a really great investment bank. And really led by Parker Gilbert and Louis Bernard and some of the senior partners who had retired and they owned a lot of stock and they put a lot of pressure on Dean Werter Morgan Stanley to make a change and that's how I ended up going back. So Phil Purcell was ousted right and then they came to you and to your surprise they said come back and be the CEO you hadn't known that you were going to be asked correct I didn't know that at all. So what was the like when you came back to where there are people cheering for you when you came back into Morgan Stanley? You've seen the film. Yes. For a young person who now is looking at a career would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David yeah listen they're not many jobs you're going to have as a young individual. You're always always learning. While Teslas and the like make for good headlines the reality is that even if every car on the road today won electric it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total US greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building's across America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need we want to do a hundred percent clean energy all electric. We want to turn buildings into Teslas just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings and if we can do it in one building we can do it in all buildings and if we do it in all buildings we'll reduce 30% of US greenhouse gas emissions.

We did see some pressure on the U.A. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. So how did you build Morgan Stanley where you focused on underwriting, trading, other areas that were new to Wall Street? Well I focused on what we did really well and what we really did extremely well was build relationships with corporations and CEOs. We were either number one or number two in the M&A tables every year so that was very important and then we said look if we're going to be doing M&A and we have these wonderful relationships and trust let's move into the secondary market and become a very active securities business. So we ended up building a very large platform at the institutional level and over time with Dean Whitter you had the retail so we really focused on being an institutional firm with a very strong retail base. Your predecessor Phil Purcell was famous for not meeting with a lot of people he was a little isolated some people accused of being you like to be in the trading floor near the trading floor being with customers all the time or with your employees is that right? Yes. And so if you found people that were ignoring their clients or ignoring their employees people working for you you tended to tell them what you thought. Without question. What I did when I was running the division fixed income division I would sit out on the trading floor and have",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3199,2022-10-15 13:22:41
14914," Tell them what you thought. Without question. What I did when I was running the division, fixed income division, I would sit out on the trading floor and have I had a glass booth office. If I had needed to have a conversation with someone, instead of going off in the conference room, we could sit in this glass office and we would have a conversation. And I would be on the phones. I'd walk around and sit down by the best salesman or the worst salesman. What are you working on? What are your clients doing? I was always involved. And I had some really fun times in doing it. I think in my book I talk about how you treat people and I get off the elevator at 8 o'clock in the morning or 7.45 and you look over to the right and they're delivery guys bringing coffee and examiner, which is a wherever you do for breakfast. And about 20 minutes later I walk back and I go out on the trading floor and I go up to the sky and I said, how long have you been here? He said about 30 minutes. He was a Hispanic, about 30 minutes. I said, if you call the person in order breakfast, you said, yes, I've called them three times. I said, give me the number. So I gave him the number and I said, this is John Mack, I want you to get your ass out here. And he comes out in front of the delivery guy and I said, look, we're no better than he is. He's just trying to make a living. And you make him wait, you take money out of his pocket if I ever hear about it again, you're fired. That went around the floor like that. You don't treat people that way. And I hope that's ingrained in me before I went to Morgan Stanley, but I really learned it from Dick Fisher. He was such a gentleman and very smart and they decisions. So the person that you almost fired, did he do that again or no? He did do it again. No one did it again. So Morgan Stanley is doing quite well and Morgan Stanley is competing principally with Goldman Sachs, I guess it was your main rival. And then all of a sudden we go into a recession, 2007, 2008. So what happened was, as I remember from reading from that period of time and from reading your book, you had this large cash reserve and you wanted to make sure you had a lot of cash, but people were afraid of Morgan Stanley maybe going under. So they said, give me my cash back. I'm going to put it in JP Morgan. It's exactly right. And so all of a sudden the cash is going all the way down. At some point you say maybe we're not going to make it. That's exactly right. Well thank God for the Japanese is what I can say. What I learned is it goes back to when Morgan Stanley would bring brokers from whether Namiura or Sumitomo didn't make any difference and they would in a training program at Morgan Stanley. And the Japanese who came through that training program respected the culture of Morgan Stanley. So when we were on the brink they stepped up and gave us the money to stand business. So it turned out to be a good investment for Mitsubishi because your stock has flourished since then. And after that happened, did you think that Wall Street learned any lessons and do you think this could happen again where you have enormous illiquidity problems or liquidity problems and Wall Street really has changed very much? Well I think the business of Wall Street hasn't changed that much, but the scrutiny on capital and capital solvency is very, very focused and I think the Fed does a much better job and paying attention to the liquidity of these investment banks. Also I think boards of directors have elevated risk management to a level that never existed when I was there. So going through a near death experience that we went through and other firms in some cases they actually died like, unfortunately, Lehman Brothers, boards focus on risk management. It's not about what deal you did, it's not about, you know, we're going to open another branch office, it's about liquidity and solvency. So after this happened and Morgan Stanley comes back and is doing quite well, you'll ultimately decide to retire. And you handed the reins over to James Gorman who would not been a lifer at Morgan Stanley and in fact he had come from Maryland, you had recruited him from there and he was a consultant, not a trader, not investment banking person. So was that controversial to give it to him? If it were confident, I never heard about anyone saying, I mean, how could you do that? James is smart, he knows the business.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3200,2022-10-15 13:27:22
14915," person. So was that controversial to give it to him? If it were confident, I never heard about anyone saying, I mean, how could you do that? James is smart. He knows the business. He spent time as a consultant, time at Merrill Lynch. I saw how you ran the business, I retail business at Morgan Stanley. He was on the management committee. I got a chance to see his interface. I would go up once a week and spend time in the office up in Westchester to be with him and now he managed. Smart as he can be, can make a decision, doesn't suffer fools. And he has a great personality. He was a natural. So for a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen, there are not many jobs you can have as a young individual, where you're always, always learning. It may be not something you can write, but Wall Street lives on the news. And what people are doing and what are the trends? I don't know how many businesses like that. If you go in the matter of action business, you have a sales cycle, you hope it's doing well. But in Wall Street, you have data every day that tells you not only what's going on in this country, what's going on in the world. So as you look at your career, what do you think you're the most proud of having done, help with New York Presbyterian, help Morgan Stanley recover from some of its problems? What are you most proud of? I'm most proud of where Morgan Stanley came from just a few hundred people to where it is now. I think taking the risk that we took during the Dean Wooder trade, having the bumps that we had to live with, it turned out to be an unbelievable investment bank with a great culture. And to have James Gorman running it now, I couldn't be happier or more proud of it. So in hindsight, if you had to do it all over again, would you have gone to medical schools from other one or you're happy you became a Wall Street person? To my mother's disappointment, thank God I came to Wall Street. We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Teresa Gao and Jennifer Fonsdatt, who are looking at these opportunities and they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. You will put a woman on Mars.

14916," Quems by Lionel Build for riders, not drivers. That's a slogan of ZUX, a California-based company hoping to revolutionize personal transportation. It's creating an entirely new autonomous vehicle targeted at the robot taxi market. Just don't call it a car. A car is, there is an inference that there is a driver, and especially a human driver. And from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver. Whereas in our robot taxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So we want to make sure that that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. The name ZUX is a reference to a marine organism that, like the robot taxi, depends on renewable energy and is able to maintain a symbiotic relationship with its surrounding habitat. Chief Executive Aisha Evans says sustainability is at the heart of what they do, but is keen to stress that going green means more than just one thing. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, shop and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. In this episode of Leaders Goes Green, I speak to ZUX Chief Executive Aisha Evans about the challenges of developing artificial intelligence, being acquired by Amazon and making a driverless future a reality. Aisha, thank you so much for joining us on Leaders With Lackwinau. Amazon acquired ZUX back in January 2020 for what reports suggested was $1.2 billion. Since then, the company has revealed it's ZUX vehicle. This is, I think, a rectangular passenger-focused vehicle with no driver seat or steering wheel. First of all, how would you describe it? We describe it as a purpose-built vehicle, but it's really a robot taxi that's its purpose. And essentially, it's about transporting people from point A to point B on demand in the most effective, cleanest and most enjoyable way. So, why won't you call it a car? Because a car is, there is an inference that there is a driver. And in our case, especially a human driver, and from an engineering standpoint, the architecture of a car is around a human driver, the hood, so that you can see ahead of you, the windshield, even the seating arrangement so that the people you're transporting do not bother you. Whereas, in our robot taxi, there is no manual driving. A human cannot really drive it to transport passengers. So, we want to make sure that that mindset, that shift, that distinction is clear. But is there a piece of technology? I sure that you wish you'd have at your hands to make it better, to make it workable 100%. No, I'd time, if I could accelerate through time. That's really, that would be fantastic. Look, it's about testing. We can drive. That's not the issue. The issue is, and we follow the rules very well. I always say that when it comes to products that use self-driving technology, there are two numbers that are too metrics that are really important. Safety, we know that in the United States, on average, over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3202,2022-10-15 13:36:07
14917," safety. We know that in the United States on average over 40,000 people lose their lives through car crashes. By the way, the pandemic did not help us. We actually spiked up to over 43,000. And those are mostly caused by the human driver's errors. You know, human were not at times the most disciplined. We're looking on phones. We're maybe a little bit dehabitated because of, you know, a couple of glasses of wine or we're talking to somebody. And that causes errors, but computers are very good at not making those types of errors. The other statistic that's really important is that on average in the United States, humans collectively drive 100 million miles before causing a fatality. Just think about it. 100 million miles and it takes a lot of testing, a lot of statistical math and forecasting to meet and beat that number because we try, we strive to be better than humans. So when you focus on safety, I said, how much in advance can actually zoogs predict events that are about to happen. We can predict things. So the way the AI stack works is, first of all, and this goes to our robot taxi and the sensor architecture and compute. It's important to give to maximize all of your chances to see what is going on around you and in your environment. And this is why our sensor architecture uses camera, light hours, radars and longwave infrared cameras. So that, for example, we can sense heat and something is alive. This is why we have them at the top four corners. So that at any point in time, three of those sensor pods are basically seeing you. And then the compute being able to come to basically fuse all of that information and data on a continuous basis. And then predict what are the agents around us going to do potentially and therefore, how should we react and work constantly in that loop. And the better the better and the faster you can do that. And basically, the more will be there. But that's not really the issue where we're having with the testing. The issue we're having with the testing is what I call the millions of unique edge cases, last minute things that happen that humans basically are very good at dealing with it. I like to say that you've been learning to deal with them as a human ever since you came out of the hospital, basically, as a baby. You're already seeing cars, agents, when do I cross, when don't I cross all those types of things so that accumulated knowledge is what computers are not very good at, but we're able to run a certain level of prediction. What is this concretely so is this reflexes is this morality issues. You could say, hey, you're not supposed to come on my oncoming lane, but the reality is that when your human driver sees somebody else come on their oncoming lane, they assess the situation and quickly either stop, slow down, go around something. It's all of those little mini maneuvers every time something's different happens. You're trying to you're not only trying to replicate the human mind, right, and I don't know how long away we are from that. It could be decades, are you trying to better to make better decisions in the human mind. We're trying to make, I don't know that they are better than the human mind, but for a robot, they make a lot of sense. So we're trying to make the kind of parallel applicable decisions so that we're moving people around. And so that means we don't we won't normally we won't let's tell you replicate what a human driver would have done, but we'll make a maneuver or a responding maneuver that makes a lot of sense is safe, keeps the flow of traffic and also our customers comfortable. I mean, you have such a complex industry that you're dealing with. It's AI, it's regulation. It's of course, actually making the vehicle. What would you describe your company has? We basically are mobility on demand company from point A to point B first for human transport that business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're an app today, whichever app you choose.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3203,2022-10-15 13:40:06
14918," transport, that business model and that those businesses exist in the world today. The only difference is that when you're on an app today, whichever app you choose, what shows up is a passenger car with a human driver. So that's the business. It exists already. All we're doing is replacing the tool, meaning it's not going to be a passenger car with a human driver. It's going to be a robot taxi that comes in. It's a more enjoyable experience. It's electric. Yes, it uses self-driving technology to move it, but that's it. So for those who think we're doing everything, we're not. We're doing the the van diagram of what is necessary to accomplish that goal. So how far away do you think we're from accomplishing that goal? You're talking about, for example, gathering information, the perception phase, right, which is cameras, radars, infrareds. And lidar. Look, it depends. We tend to be very realistic about what's going on here. This is a beginning of a wave. When you look at all of the big industry transformation, they did not happen overnight. They took quite a while. So in a geofanse area, we hope to be out there very soon. Our focus is being on public roads with our robot taxi soon, but it will be in a moderate small to moderate scale. And then the question is, how ability to be able to add geofancies to add cities on a continuous basis and in a way that is sort of good for customers? Because there's no point in doing it in one tiny little geofanse and not being able to go to a bigger, dreovans, because then the customers will be like, this is a gimmick. When is that coming to me? Up next, evolution isn't always a smooth process. And Aisha Evans expects things will get bumpy on the road to the future of personal transportation. But she says innovation will find a way. One thing we'd know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. A fundamental change in the way we move around will require a fundamental rethinking of the way cities are built, especially when taking sustainability into account. I carry on the conversation with Zook's chief executive Aisha Evans. When you focus on green or sustainability, how do you think this will change cities? So you know, I think it will improve things dramatically. The fleet will be or is fully electric. That's a good thing. Second of all, today, humans, when we buy a car, we actually only use it 4% of the time. The rest of the time, it's parking either in our garage or in somebody else's garage or in the street and taking time. And so just from a mathematical standpoint, we're building more things than we need strictly for human transport. So we will make less things because when you're not using the robot axis, somebody else is using it. So it's very effective and efficient. Now, I call it an improvement because we as an industry, and I mean overall, there needs to be a lot of improvement in the battery ecosystem, whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the use of the battery.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3204,2022-10-15 13:44:24
14919," them, whether it's batteries themselves, whether it's the making of them, the using of them, as well as what happens on the end of life of a battery. And I believe that they are still a lot of work to do, but I think there'll be a lot of innovation in that space. But when do you think we'll have the first stop driving robotaxi in a big city that's also very eco-friendly? It's going to be, I don't know, we don't get into dates at Zooks because we feel that it's better to show and then tell than the opposite. As an industry, and I'm saying an industry, meaning I think everyone included, we've made too many, oh, it will happen. We've kind of like been, oh my gosh, it's going to happen tomorrow morning. Oh my gosh, it's never going to happen. So we don't really get into the dates, but within definitely a more realistic time frame that maybe some people are putting out there. I mean, testing has started for all of us. And so I think it's much sooner than people realize. The question will be the game of then replicating that to several cities, to an entire country, and then to several countries. Were you frustrated or are you frustrated? Now when you started, did you think it would be quicker to have these self-driving robotaxies or slower? You're going to out me. That's not nice. I actually think it's going about, I thought it would be even slightly slower. Even the ecosystem of driving, with passenger cars, from the cars and buggy and all of the infrastructure that comes around it to where we are today, it took a little bit of while. I actually think that it's going at the correct pace. It's slightly slower, maybe than I expected, but it's about the pace. This is a big deal. This is a hard technology, and this is a societal transformation. At the same time, we talk a lot about this environmental transformation, maybe taking longer than we were expecting because of some components not being readily available. Do you worry for the car industry for the industry urine that we just don't have the right components for the battery or for the self-driving vehicles? I think we have the right component at this point in time. The question is, how are we going to stimulate the industry, academia, research, governments, regulatory to pour a lot into this space? It's not just about having mandates. By 2000X, all cars will be XYZ. There's a whole infrastructure across all of the different vectors, including academia and research, that also has to come with us so that we have enough innovation for the scale that's going to be necessary. How do you change people's perceptions? I imagine that you're worried that in certain countries, people won't want to give up their cars. Yes, disruption is always interesting. There are a lot of countries whose economies depend on the car industry. I do worry about that, but I think that one of the mistakes we've made in terms of disruption is to not have engineering empathy for the company or the country that's being disrupted. I think it's better to have conversations now. Figure out how we managed through the transition together as opposed to good or bad. Because one thing we know about humanity and our history is that progress is unstoppable. I like to say sometimes for effect that if you could wake up somebody who died 2000 years ago magically and then drop them in the middle of New York City or Mumbai or Cape Town, they literally couldn't function. They would know what to do. I think that we need to be generous with each other and manage through the transition together, but understand that this is unstoppable and inevitable. Even someone who passed maybe 100 years ago would be complete. We lost in New York City. Exactly. They would be looking for the stable and the buggy and the coach and be like, no, no, no, you need to either buy a car, take the subway, take public transportation or call, you know, a mobility. And by the way, where's your phone? No, no, we don't mean this phone. We need a phone that's a computer in your pocket. Do you know what an app is? So yes, it would, that's why I think that we just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But actually, if you look at",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3205,2022-10-15 13:48:56
14920," Okay, do you know what an app is? So yes, it would, that's why I think that we just need to be patient and drive through the transition together. But if we look at the last let's say 20, 30 years, it's amazing the pace of change and how quick that was in the last six to seven years. Can we replicate that again? Oh, I'm confidence we can. Look, prior to being in this industry, I was in the wireless industry, had a lot of fun with that from, you know, people forget, even the landline was an evolution, right? It used to be switchboards and an operator needed to be on the other end of that. And then from there we went to cell phones. I remember being in a lab when we received the first text string on an LCD screen through GPRS and Edge. But then we were already working in research on LTE and basically Wi-Fi and all these things. And we were dreaming of having people having the internet in their pocket and what that would enable. By the way, we didn't really think about apps or anything like that. But we just trusted that with the availability of the of the of the infrastructure, people will innovate on top of that and boy, did they? And I expect the exact same thing to happen in the self-driving space. Up next, Aisha Evans on what life is like being part of the Amazon family. No, I don't hang out with bezels and dracy and lymph and I mean, this is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company and that's really the basis of the relationship. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11. Because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent high in the air, disrupt before you change the world, Bloomberg. We all know Jeff Bezos has otherworldly travel ambitions, but his acquisition of ZUX in 2020 proved that the Amazon boss very much has his eye on the future of transport on this planet too. I continue the conversation with ZUX Chief Executive Aisha Evans. What's it like being part of the Amazon family? Do you get much exposure to Jeff Bezos? I get this question a lot. First of all, we love being inside Amazon. We literally are grateful and privileged because this takes a lot of capital. There are a lot of really good success stories and also good learnings at Amazon about being long-term oriented and being part of creating a new industry and driving to use a cliché transformation. We get a lot of good advice. It's been really great. No, I don't hang out with Bezos and Jassy and Lemp. This is a job. They want us to get to market. They want us to make the progress we say we're going to make. They want us to build a great company and that's really the basis of the relationship. Did you always think you'd get here when you were growing up? You were always from my understanding very passionate about science and technology.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3206,2022-10-15 13:53:01
14921," And that's really the basis of the relationship. Did you always think you'd get here when you were growing up? You were always, from my understanding, very passionate about science and technology. You know, when you were kid, it's funny. I wish I could get a redo. Because man, I would be a lot more chilled than, I mean, I knew I wanted to study and be in the field of science and technology. I knew I wanted to match it and mix it with what enabled things for humanity and society across all continents. But exactly what form that would take and whether I was going to make it, I often think about, you know, when something bad happens to a human, I often think about, well, why them and not me? So no, I was a lot more stressed out about, is it going to work out than am I going to be exactly here? But I'm privileged and happy to be here. I feel blessed. Is that the kind of advice that you give to, if someone very young work to come and see you and say, like, I don't know what the jobs of tomorrow, what the future brings, what should I study at university? What would you tell them? So first, I always tell people, spend a lot of time with yourself. The longest relationship you're going to have in life is with yourself. Understand who you are. I can tell you that I don't know that I fully understand Aisha yet, but there are a lot of things I understand. Simple example, you know, Aisha likes disruption. So do not put Aisha in charge of something that doesn't need to be disrupted. Because she'll mess it up. And that doesn't make me good or bad. It just makes me different. So spend a lot of time with yourself. Second thing is understand your passions. Because if something doesn't feel like work, it feels, you love it. I know that's a cliche. Then you'll be able to go through the ups and downs of it. And you'll be able to evolve with it. Third, I believe that the blend is the most important thing right now. I think not understanding technology at all is going to make it difficult if you want to be in that field or in sort of the field that drives things. But understanding empathy and humanity and blending technology with that is where it's at. I mean, AI is all about that at the end of the day. Talk to me a little bit. If you have to choose between sustainability, right? If you look at, so it's sustainable, it's green, but this very advanced technology for a driverless. If you had to choose between the two, which one would you choose? It's a non-choice. They have to advance together. Now, we can make some compromises, short term versus medium term versus long term, but it has to go together. I mean, sustainability. And that's one of the things that's a little bit of a pet peeve of mine. It's not just about electrifying. That's not what sustainability is. More and more people are coming up the economic social strata. They want to do stuff like everybody else. They want to have access to knowledge, good lives, shop, and so on. And the infrastructure is saturated. And we need to think about things holistically when it comes to sustainability, not just electrification, but it doesn't have to happen overnight, though we need to get going. What kind of leader are you? An evolving leader, a learning leader. I place a lot of focus on people. At the end of the day, my job is to serve the people so that we can reach the goal. I can't do anything by myself. I already know what I think. And so what's more important is how do I enable others? How do I understand why they think the way they do? And how do we get to the same goal? I think that I'm a little bit of a control freak, but this is in rehabilitation. I've been on it for 15 years. That's probably the thing that's the hardest. And it manifests itself usually on Fridays at 5 p.m. And so everybody at Zooks knows that if you're going to schedule a difficult meeting on Friday at 5 p.m., you might need to manage through Aisha because I'm just exhausted by that time. And my ability to control myself is not as effective. Do you remember the hardest day in your career? And what did you learn from it? I've had plenty of hard days. I mean, one hard day was at Intel. I was in a very, very, very difficult meeting and situation. I was angry coming out of that meeting. And I will always be grateful to Stacey Smith. He was the CFO back then. He gave me a call and he said,",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3207,2022-10-15 13:57:45
14922," And I was angry coming out of that meeting. And I will always be grateful to Stacey Smith. He was the CFO back then. He gave me a call and he said, how are you feeling? I said, not good. I use choice words. And I'm going to do this, dad and the other. And he basically said, look, first of all, I hear you. I understand why you feel that way. Why don't we do this? If Monday morning you still feel like sending that email, then send it. But hold it in your inbox until Monday. And needless to say, I didn't send it Monday. I learned a lot from that sponsorship, generosity, being proactive, managing your triggers and so on. I've had some tough zoos moments, especially around choosing what to do long-term. But stay true to your principle and play the long game, not the short game. Because with zoos, if we had chosen the short game, it would have been not good for the company in the long run. Hi, Shia. Thank you so much for joining us today. Francine, my pleasure. Thank you. When the price of anything goes up, the consequences reach far beyond what you'd expect. But perhaps most of all, when it comes to food. In 2010, surging food prices helped spark the Arab Spring. Lives were lost, regimes fell, and the consequences are still with us. Once again, food prices are rising and fast. Energy costs, broken supply chains, and surging demand were just some of the factors that have driven food prices to their first record high since the Arab Spring. And that's all before a war between two of the world's biggest food producers. Ukraine is called the bread basket of Europe. And taken with Russia, the two account for about a quarter of global wheat trade, they produce more than half of the world sunflower seeds in oil, nearly 20% of the barley. Now throw in rising energy prices and processing, transporting, even refrigerating food gets more expensive. Plus, fertilizer production is extremely energy intensive. Less fertilizer means lower crop yield and prices rise even more. The pandemic revealed how complicated and fragile global trade systems are. Global agriculture, perhaps even more so. Unlike metals, for example, food goes bad. And crops take months to grow and are vulnerable to unpredictabilities like the weather. Rising food prices will be felt everywhere, but the poorest countries in the world will be hit the hardest. And as all these factors compound, the real fear is that record high will lead to record high and ultimately to a global food crisis with vast consequence.

14923," This week's Special Contributor Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey Governor and EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nuclear hermitage, a huge role at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won. And must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. And we see that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it will be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2 percent and core accelerating to 6.6 percent year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trusses government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. We want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed share Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones, we went to bed last night not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted and called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing, with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone after the CPI numbers came out. Over the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the Nasdaq down over 3%, and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%. To help us sort out a wild week in the markets, we welcome now Joe Anfini, partner in advisors capital management, and Lizanne Saunders, chief investment strategist at Chow Schwab. So welcome back both of you to Wall Street Week. Let me start with you, Lizanne. What happened this week? I feel like we hit by a Mac truck. So I think it was probably mostly technical, the reversal that we saw yesterday on an intraday basis in the first part of the day. You did see the swoon take the S&P to below 3517. And I'm not a technician, but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher. And that probably kicked in a combination of buying hedges being taken off, some short covering, and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down and yield yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3209,2022-10-15 14:06:19
14924," maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar, but that could also help to explain today's weakness too, because just saw reversals there. So Joanna Femre and a noise, I think, is fair to say in the equity markets there, but on Friday, actually, they gave up pretty much, they got back on Thursday. So when you net net, when you get through it all, what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know, David, I think what we learn is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy, not just here in the US. And those two price reports we got, the PPI and the CPI, reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings. The market, finally, perhaps, is digesting that. Let's say there's a lot of talk about it. Sorry, go ahead, please. Yeah, I think Joanne's absolutely right. And I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed, from Powell, that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility, but financial system instability maybe what could bring the Fed back in. But even in a situation like that, what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates. And I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah, there could be certainly more digesting to come. Particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual. It's not just the inflation problem, right? The US has a labor shortage, born of the pandemic, born of early retirees, born of a lack of legal migration, immigration into the US. And that problem is not one that the Fed can solve. And so they still have very high consumer demand and a shortage of supply, no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand, there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic. So they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed. And the risks that are out there haven't really abated in many ways. Although finally, we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne, I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad. There are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong. It's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world. We've gone to a multiple economy, it feels like sometimes. We have, and I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic, the nature of it, how it unfolded, is that we've been in this rolling cycle. So during the throes of the pandemic, when all the stimulus kicked in, both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side, that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services. That became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing. Then as you saw reopening, you saw that pent-down demand on the good side, you saw pent-up demand on the services side. That tends to be the stickier components of inflation. So even though we're seeing disinflation now, on the good side, we've got it on the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down, downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars. And they're putting cars in inventory, waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3210,2022-10-15 14:10:53
14925," And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower, middle, and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation really curtail their spending like Walmart saw? Whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the even the near term as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, join in to your point about the upper end in better shape as witness by what the retailers are saying. There's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect given that even though the excess saving story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there there might be some hesitancy. Join last thought here. We all talk about when is the market going to bond them about? When is the bad news bond about? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the build from here. I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk the global economy is facing. It's not just the U.S. and inflation problems globally. We have the war in Ukraine. And there are some maybe low probability but very large risks associated with that. And then you have China and they're continuing zero-COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. And the real question there is will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world. And now we might find that U.S. companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point. And we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Jim Anfinian, Lysian Saunders, we'll be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's go ahead and have a next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in to give anybody? The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep at it and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said above compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you'll learn every day. And if you keep at it, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3211,2022-10-15 14:14:59
14926," very additive because you'll learn every day and if you keep at it it's very very helpful. In your observation of investors what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make selling it the wrong time and they sell when the prices go down or yes not keeping people have conviction or they invest for the if they invest for the right reasons just keep at it. Everything you need to get set for the start of U.S. trading, Bloomberg the Open with Jonathan Terrell, drilling down in the numbers and preparing you as only Bloomberg can weekdays on Bloomberg. Well this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously and the housing industries trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Lewis Ruck has your own Wall Street. Back in 1981, believe it or not 41 years ago now when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy you may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity and the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up not down and the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfinia of advisors capital management and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So Joe Anfinia come to you. The question is what do we do other money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors and it really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. So one area to go to is some relatively stable companies whether it's a general mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the four or five six percent range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And then that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But you know, it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with the volatility. Lizanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's an hour gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market, components of say big tech and look at it monolithically make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, lower volatility is kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3212,2022-10-15 14:19:23
14927," If you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness, trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we were going to have bonds, but those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now, and they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that with in a balance strategy with the equity front, you know, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done in it's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Lizanna, you did the point yet where you'd consider duration that is going longer durations for the income. So my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you can consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. You know, we've gone from a from a teen environment. There is no alternative to Tia. There is an alternative and there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies a little bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, you know, Lizanna, I wanted to pick up that was exactly the point I was going to make is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we, you know, continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances and time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. You know, for example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now, what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash flow that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even, can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated more than compensated for that cost of inflation or roading the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Lizanna, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth and for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine, what are earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week that they're earnings, which actually we're pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub, though, is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April, May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar, and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now, once the quarter is all said and done, the month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S&P earnings growth. Be exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And that's, if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earnings season, not just for, did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook. If you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking an account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3213,2022-10-15 14:23:52
14928," Reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Ann was saying. The real question I think around this earnings season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. We don't know if, when, how large a recession will be, how broad it will be. So investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple of years, three years, five years. Right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. Yep. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Nansan. It's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week on Global Wall Street. This next Wall Street week on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Like just be honest, we've had sort of a shift in our we in some sort of circulation fears moment. People were talking about that all day yesterday. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in burning them for the government to handle. You foresee two thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg. We're going to take a look at the global business authority. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Now to look ahead to next week on Global Wall Street starting with Julia Sally in Singapore. Thanks David. Chateau will dominate the agenda in the week ahead. Following the party congress, the PBOC sets its one year rate on Monday. Bloomberg economics expects it to remain unchanged. Tuesday we'll see a data blitz with third quarter GDP likely to show only a week recovery and September activity highlighting consumption, weakness and the important role public investment is playing in propping up the overall recovery. Elsewhere, Bank Indonesia is likely to hike by 50 basis points and Australia will probably report moderate jobs growth for September. Now over to Guy Johnson in London. Guy? The UK will remain the center of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday the big question, will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday we get inflation data, we also get housing data and then on Friday we get retail sales plus we've got S&P and movies both updating their UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week. Yes laughing feeds 몰�ئ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3214,2022-10-15 14:28:35

Wednesday we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers, pay attention to that one and then on Thursday we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America. Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Netflix, Tesla and IBM. But also play close attention to chip equipment maker lamb research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China, restrictions that hit at a time when the industry was already grappling with the slowdown in demand. Economic data next week include industrial production, housing starts and existing home sales. Elsewhere shareholders of Spirit Airlines are scheduled to vote on whether to move forward with JetBlue's $3.8 billion offered by the company. And if you're a sports fan, a great week ahead for you. The NBA regular season tips off on Tuesday and Major League Baseball's postseason advances with the league championship games. Thanks to Julian Sally, Guy Johnson and Romaine Bostic. Coming up, if we're really serious about getting to zero mission, experts say expanded nuclear power has to be part of the plan. We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. When U.S. jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. OK, so you're moving in on me quick, just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will concede. I can see. Ah. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you. It's a lofty goal, but times are wasting. Just as John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is, unless you do enough between.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3215,2022-10-15 14:32:06
14930," The special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is, unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantaged if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not, convincing the public about safety may remain an issue, given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. And it's unclear exactly when you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is, what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially oppose the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today, and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear, go for it. And to get us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving and we're a 24-7 society, as is the rest of the world. The world is 24-7. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima, Daishi, overall worldwide. It's been, it's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given costs and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world and we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that. And well, we would first of all give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. And you saw an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline when California took the Senate, an offering nuclear reactor offline. Their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that you, if you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer, they're very real questions. I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long, it's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility, they can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3216,2022-10-15 14:36:48
14931," say for technology, they are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference, particularly if you think about the rural parts of America where you're not on the grid or you're not close to the grid. You can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear or is it technological development such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know, they don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that when the time we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you'd fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They might have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being, it's not this massive thing, this size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 90, 87 to 90 percent fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the quote unquote bad stuff to down to 15 percent, let's say. And it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was Three Mile Island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself, in the reactor itself, were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. There were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system really that you had the partial meltdown, Fukushima Daiishi. That wasn't because of the earthquake. It was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with the reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing, can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, then, in fact, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was not even 10 years ago. I guess there were two, four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. And we were very hopeful with those who are going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles. But you want to have those regulations in place because that's what protects the community and makes sure that things are safe and streamlined how you approach them so that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety. But to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in. And that's one of the big challenges that seems to get so overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3217,2022-10-15 14:41:04
14932," more modular reactors which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not, I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former Governor Christine Todd with and now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributed Larry Summers of Harvard. Let's next our Wall Street week on Bloomberg. Music Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on the space really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. From the world of politics to the world of business. Balance of power with David Weston, views and metastas inside, from and about politics power players, weekdays, this is Bloomberg. Music This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week, he is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we'd waited for this week. And boy, they came in, how to expect it. It's been doing this repeatedly now. And what do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure, which is wages. Or you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking. And I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Krugman, who are very quick now to focus on housing. And the fact that the private indices lead the public indices, when the private indices are looking soft, but were entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3218,2022-10-15 14:45:26
14933," We're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. So I think we've got to be very, very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation? How can you tell? What are you looking at right now to tell you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component. Whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices. And very crucially for me I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything and all of those are saying that inflation's not really coming down very fast if it's coming down at all and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers Larry a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and more importantly the management of the British economy. Look I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges. I have said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition. I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down down the road. So I think we're going to see more tremors more aftershocks more problems. At the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal and the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry I guess I'm asking to say we have global slowdown IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slowdown at the same time we have central banks in the development countries really all raising rates at the same time what is the likelihood we're going to see similar won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit some of the non bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off some of them may be in the private sector I think more of them may be international you know something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access and I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries but don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today so I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3219,2022-10-15 14:49:29
14934, So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets and I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There's some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IIF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece also actually speaking with David Maltes the head of the World Bank about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? No I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way and I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach and we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital and instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important we need to do both of them because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition and so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. So if there's a lack there Larry often that like comes for a lack of leadership do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury the White House or for that matter at the World Bank I mean would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area and I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very very difficult moment in Africa at a very very difficult moment in Latin America at a very very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but it's not gotten too much attention is what the United States did was expect to sell the conductors and China the chips market really went down substantially it took a lot of the tech with it at a time of so much difficulty globally what are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions you know the kind of large-style cutoff on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced I don't think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information which those of us on the outside don't have but this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness this is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice this was a pretty across the board effort in something that's very very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology and so I think it's going to have some far reaching implications. Larry finally we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week tell us about what you took away from that award. Look I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time which is that banks and finance are different that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on and that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial energy.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3220,2022-10-15 14:53:58
14935," and the mental of what's going on and that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else. It was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Divvig using mathematics. Careful historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers.

They say the one with the most toys wins and let's face it, toys usually cost money and the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take for example Jeff Bezos knew yet the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Elon Musk agreed to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. Something most people think is worth a lot less than the price tag. That is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and the stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who for the last three months has been saying that Twitter has been lying about its user base. But what happens when you spare no expense, go all in, put all your chips on the table and don't win your dream prize. Consider the case of Hillary Clinton's campaign spending $1.4 billion on the 2016 presidential race substantially more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. The poor Columbia Pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Bady just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. It's the voices. It does this look like an oasis.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3221,2022-10-15 14:58:06
14936," for inflation today and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. Is this the Oasis? Does this look like an Oasis? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those cultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Max. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off that's going. Leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base and thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and have all this momentum behind them and then they blow it. That's the match. That's metzing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's the order? Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? What are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. All demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. That's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about going to the store, doing a good job of customer service, of really picking the right products for the consumer. We are seeing that being very appealing to women. Hello, how are you? I'm so grateful to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. What do you think about all this celebs getting into the store? I think it was more last year. I think it's kind of a way of that past. No, I don't think so, but I think it's like any time that frankly it went a lot of other people get into crypto, right? Other audiences too. It's when it's in the news a lot. When does that happen? A lot of times when the prices are going up. She was a federal prof.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3222,2022-10-15 15:02:25
14937," She was a federal prosecutor going after gangs and the mob before being handed for next assignment, taking down Bitcoin. Kedi Han soon realized this new technology was much more than a tool used by criminals. She dove deep and became a crypto convert, swapping her prosecutor hat for a board seat at Coinbase, and became the first female general partner at Venture Firm and Recent Horror Whits. Han, now a prolific crypto investor, recently launched her own fund with one and a half billion dollars to deploy. It's the largest fund ever raised by a single investor. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0 CEO and founder of Han Ventures, Kedi Han. Kedi, it's so great to have you. Great to be back here in the studio with you, Emily. I want to start with a vibe check. Okay. What state of the crypto cycle are we in right now? It was hot. Yeah. And then it got pretty cold. Well, look, Emily, zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade, if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before, however, I think one of the things that's a little bit different now is with each new crypto cycle, more and more people come into it. And so it's more and more pronounced each cycle. And I would push back on it's not. I think it depends on what area of the ecosystem you're looking at. We think developers think crypto and Web3 is still really hot. I am seeing a lot less of those. We're all going to make it hashtags. I am seeing a lot less of them too, although I am spending less time on Twitter, so maybe that's why. But with each cycle, there are new acronyms. What hasn't happened is a crypto winter in the midst of really serious global macro conditions. So we have inflation, kind of at record highs for our generation, in our lifetime. And then we have also a war that's broken out in the Ukraine. And we have a number of other factors going on here. So that's very different. There was some serious carnage out there. Socius, Luna, three-houros, what's been your takeaways from what? I don't want to sit here and tell you that algorithmic stablecoins are bad, because I actually think they're really interesting. However, I think what happened is you had, in this case you mentioned, Luna and Tara, you know. That was an algorithmic stablecoin that was getting pretty widespread adoption, relative to what the tech could do. I didn't realize you spent your teenage years living in Egypt and learning Arabic. Tell me about your upbringing. I was always uprooted. My dad worked for a large company, and we were always moving just when I would get comfortable in one space. And I think actually that's pretty important if you fast-forward and look at my career. I'm comfortable being in uncomfortable situations. You know, I didn't know a lot about venture when I got into it initially. I didn't know a lot about crypto when I got into it initially. And I was okay asking questions. I was okay not knowing the local acronyms or the Namanclature of a particular field. And I'm, you know, I'm taken right back to my teenage years in Cairo, moving from Houston, Texas one day to downtown Maddie in Cairo the next day. You studied law? I did. You clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy. That's right. You became a federal prosecutor. You were taking on prison gangs. Yup. And the mafia. That must have taken a really thick skin. I was doing it at age 25. And now if I kind of take a step back and you know, I think that happens at different points in your career. Like, whoa, if I would have analyzed that a little more at the time. And I'm kind of in some ways glad I didn't. I just dove right in. Because I found it fascinating. There was a human aspect to it. And people's stories. And I felt like those stories mattered. So I was drawn to criminal law. And became a federal prosecutor and I did cases involving violent crime. But then really mistrying cases. Being back in the courtroom. Being before the grand jury. Like the prosecutor you would see on TV going to try those murder cases. Doing those two hour closing arguments. That's right. And so moved out here to California. I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time. Outlaw motorcycle gangs. Hostage taking. Bank robberies. Armed bank robberies. In socio-c Dingen, that ausions. Food surveillance. Is going to die. Is on the court.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3223,2022-10-15 15:07:17
14938," California, I indicted the largest prison gang in the world at the time, outlaw motorcycle gangs, hostage taking, bank robberies, armed bank robberies, there was really not a kind of criminal case by that point in my career. I hadn't done it. It was right around that time, 2012, one of my bosses came in and said, let's have that same energy that you brought to those gang cases, to those murder cases. And let's go ahead and have you investigate this new criminal technology. That we really need to look into and possibly shut this down. So you created the first crypto currency task force? How would you describe it? Fortunately, several of us in the government realized at the time, it's not possible, also not desirable, because Bitcoin is not an entity, it's not a person, right, it's a protocol. And it would be like saying, let's go shut down cash, let's go shut down the internet, it's not possible, probably wouldn't be a good idea either. I was using crypto and technologies like the Bitcoin blockchain, because that's all that existed then, this is 2012, 2013, to actually uncover criminal activity. So I didn't think that that technology was bad. Frankly, it was a tool that helped me uncover the various activity. And by the way, it was a step level function improvement better than compliance by banks. I'll just go ahead and say it. That's a little bit controversial, but I had spent a decade subpoenaing large financial institutions and five times out of 10 didn't get back what I needed. One case I worked on, and people always say, you shut down the Silk Road. What actually happened? I was looking into something completely, not having to do with anything at all of the Silk Road, and came across some, what looked to be some kind of odd activity. And it turns out that a couple of federal agents on the Silk Road Task Force out of Washington, DC, were cropped. And that is the case that I ended up in dining, and I ended up prosecuting those agents, and they both went to prison. So that's the aspect of what Silk Road case that I worked on. I would never, never have been able to uncover that criminal activity by those agents, because they were federal agents they knew how to cover their tracks had they not use Bitcoin blockchain. Right? So that technology right there, if they had just used wires or cash or even bank wires, we would never have uncovered that. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. Stock that is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. Upgraded today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market. It is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't going to long today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So, Apatosaurus is an example. Now, it's had really long skinny tails. So, I made a computer model that showed that, in fact, the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now, the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. Okay. And that crack is a sonic boom. Yep. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. So, you became kind of a crypto-convert after this. You joined the board of coinbase. That's right. Very early on. How did you and coinbase and Brian Armstrong come together? I hosted an event here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian. It was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors and crypto, who wanted to usher in this new...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3224,2022-10-15 15:11:28
14939," Here in San Francisco at the Federal Reserve Bank, and believe it was there that it wasn't just Brian, it was a lot of what I'll call legitimate actors in crypto who wanted to usher in this new wave, this new ecosystem. And then we brought together the heads of all kinds of agencies. Really in an effort to kind of talk about building bridges, you know, the government and the crypto industry. We're never going to see eye to eye on a lot of things, but we did think there were some commonalities. Coinbase is a company that has suffered, they've been losing share, the valuation of public markets has plummeted. Why do you think that is and how do you think it can be fixed? Yeah, well I think again a few things it's tied to. One, a large aspect of Coinbase's business now, of course, is trading revenue. And that's down when prices are down. And you know, the company's been very transparent about that long before going public. I mean, also if you look at its S1, it specifically identifies that. And just how volatile crypto cycles are. So I think that's part of it. It's judged by public markets as a technology stock or as a financial services company. By the way, I think it's both. I think it's not just a financial services company. I think it's so much more. I think it's really a portal to this whole new ecosystem. You were also on the board of OpenC until recently there's an insider trading situation or accusation going on there. Coinbase has also had employees accused of insider trading. How much is this happening within crypto companies and within the industry and how big a problem is it? And crypto is under the microscope. So where you have a case, two cases, three cases in crypto ecosystem, which now is a trillion dollar industry. I think multi-billion approaching trillion dollar industry, you're always going to be able to find examples like that. So I don't want to make too much out of a handful of cases. That said, the company, Coinbase, OpenC, take these things incredibly seriously. Along with your position at Coinbase, you became a partner at one of the most important story venture capital firms in Silicon Valley. That is Andrewson Harwitz. What was your experience at A16Z? There I met Chris Dixon and I met Ben Horwitz and I met Mark Andrewson and I had worked with them for just about a year, maybe a little bit over when they asked me to come and co-run their crypto funds at Andrewson Harwitz. Again, I jumped at that chance and I think really that speaks to the fact that as I've said before, things are a hell yes or there are no and it was a hell yes for me. So Andrewson Harwitz is the kind of place where if you make a partner, you don't leave. How did Mark and Ben respond when you said, yeah, I want to leave to start a crypto fund of my own. As you might know, Emily, they're an anchor. They're an anchor check into my fund and I'm very grateful for that. Mark and Chris and folks like them are also personal LPs. So I felt very supported when I shared that decision and I will say that it was not running away from Andrewson Harwitz, it was running to another opportunity. And you know, crypto is not, what do they say? It's not a spectator sport. It's like, you're in it. It's very young. It's 24-7. It's global and it's hustle. And that's a trade-off. It's a life trade-off. And at this point in my career and in my life, if I was going to continue to make that trade-off, I just wanted to do it and do it in a way that was really true to me. So you struck out on your own. Yes. I'm very grateful to everyone who's been in the financials. What gave you the courage to do that? What was the spark that lit the fire? Yeah. That got you to say, I need to do this and do this now. Sure. What I set out to do was to continue to invest in this ecosystem that I think is so broad that decision was very purposeful and the timing was very purposeful. We have an early stage fund that does seed stage, series A, even series B, and then we have what we call an acceleration fund, which is, it's not a growth fund. It's a crypto growth fund and I think those are different things. It's later stage. It might be crypto publics. Certain kinds of public tokens were set up to hold tokens and participate in the token ecosystem or later stage companies. I mean, there are now several crypto, many crypto unicorns. Space has become really competitive. Even though you say, you know, crypto has had its kind of ups and downs, the thing is, a lot of people in some of those last cycles have seen the kind of venture style returns that can be had in crypto. And so you've had a lot of new funds enter the space and that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then from, you know, all of these other crypto funds are more even that.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3225,2022-10-15 15:16:25
14940," of new funds enter the space. And that's driven up competition. So what differentiates on ventures then? From all of these other crypto funds, or even more traditional venture capitalists, like entries in Harrow, it's Sequoia, they also have crypto funds now. Well, I think a lot of traditional venture capital funds now have crypto funds. It used to just be like a regulatory designation. It was like, are you an RIA, which is registered investment advisor? I would say for crypto founders today, it's not enough to just be an RIA, right? They, frankly, I don't even know if a lot of them care. That's a regulatory designation. What crypto founders today want to know is do you live and breathe crypto? Do you inhale the discourse? Are you part of the community? Do you participate in governance? Are you gonna be staking these kind of crypto verbs out there? And if you're not really in this space full time, I think it's very hard to run a successful crypto fund. We don't have a hedge fund component. So we're not sitting here buying and trading and selling. That's a hedge fund structure. And there are crypto hedge funds. We're not one. We're making seven to 10 year best. Just how hard is it to launch a crypto fund from scratch? You know, it's hard, but it's not impossible. We don't have a crystal ball. I don't know. I can't predict cycles, but I knew that we were in a cycle where you saw so much further an excitement around the space. And I already talked about what makes this different, but I think one thing also is we are a nimble strike force. We don't fish in the same pond. We have the crypto natives. We have efficient execution. We have operators, seasoned operators who really know how to stick the landing. And I think that's reflected on our culture. I would say the only thing that's changed in our strategy as a result of the market correction is really more of a focus on early stage, but we still have our late stage fund. And when we see valuations, which I think we'll still see correct, spoiler. I think we'll continue to see some corrections. And so we might deploy our later stage fund a little bit more slowly. It might not be on an even 50-50 cadence. And that's okay. Long-term, our strategy hasn't changed. Long-term, we're committed to this space. How much do you think valuations are going to correct? You know, it's just, I can't give you a one-size-fits-all answer because crypto is not a monolith. You have some crypto companies that really follow more of an enterprise-sass business model. You have others that are layer one protocols. You have still others that are consumer-facing applications. And I think one of the things we're seeing right now is the infrastructure layer. And that's where we're spending a lot of our time, by the way. And we think more and more use cases will come about when the infrastructure layer is in place. So my own view is we are not rushing to deploy. We're certainly not getting caught up. You do get VC FOMO and have you to avoid that. You know, look, I think it's very easy to get into that mindset, right? It's because it's a competitive sport. It's a competitive space. And I think I'd be lying if I said that that doesn't influence anyone. I try to, what I do, and I think I do differently, is I try to take stock of that. Oh, that's the FOMO mentality kicking in. That's bad. Again, you don't want to over-correct, though. What we look for is we look for amazing founders. It doesn't matter if I think valuations will correct. If they're amazing founders, there's a huge tam. We also look for what's your regulatory plan? If you're launching a token, what's your plan to comply with the law? What's your plan for security, by the way? We've seen a lot of hacks in the space. We want to really dive in there and make sure that the founders have been thoughtful about, especially if they're custodian customer funds, keeping those funds secure. If it's a cross-chain bridge, what are the exploits? Have you changed your strategy at all, given the downturn? And what? Have you backed out of any deals or decided not to do certain deals? Because the conditions have changed. Don't you raise the phone? We have decided not to do certain deals. We've never backed out of a deal. We have decided not to do a few deals. Because we think that pricing was ahead of progress, candidly. And we might have been wrong about that, Emily. We might have been wrong about that. But I think if we were wrong not to do a couple of deals, better that we might have been right. Because if we were wrong about that, I think we can find a way to still invest in those projects later. Well, one thing I'm hearing is that a lot of dry powder has just stepped up. Because all these funds raised a lot of money raised. What was the biggest fund ever for a single person, not just a woman? Yeah. Anyone? Yeah. Are you confident you're going to have a place to put all that money? I am. But if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs even during.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3226,2022-10-15 15:20:24
14941," You're gonna have to put up place to put all that money. I am, but if I don't have a place to put it, I'm not just going to go willing, nearly deploy it. One of the things that we told our LPs, even during that period when we raised our fund, which was when crypto was undeniably still on a bull run, we said that we are going to be pretty steadfast, sticking to a tier deployment cycle. And I think one thing that's changed is that might have lengthened. It certainly hasn't shortened, but we will, again, we have, we feel very good that we have the capital to back routines when we see them. So you think we're gonna fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind, China. We're falling behind. Bloomberg has enhanced search on the terminal to deliver what you need when you need it.

NFTs are you concerned about the declining demand? We are going to increasingly live in a digital world. And I happen to think that if you live in a digital world, you're going to want to own digital goods in that world. You're not just going to be satisfied to rent them, which is what we do now. We buy our content from walled gardens without digital scarcity, which is what NFTs unlock. You don't really own anything. You're subject to the whims of a platform. And I think NFTs and digitally scarce goods fundamentally change that. I think you'll see NFTs back again. But we are spending a lot of time in the infrastructure layer. Like I tell you, zero knowledge, technology, scalability. But we think of that as the plumbing. If you think of the fiber-optic cables. Remember, you couldn't have had YouTube and Netflix with dial-up. You couldn't have streamed content. The same is true of crypto use cases. We think that there will be a lot of new use cases unlocked when the infrastructure is there, when it's more efficient, when it's more user-friendly. And so we're spending a lot of our time there. President Biden issues this crypto executive order. There are a number of ports that are coming do. What do you want to see from the administration when it comes to regulation? Are you optimistic that we will get there? Yeah. We were so delighted to see that executive order. This is not something you should normally be delighted about. But why we were is because it was to us a real recognition that this is a US government saying, this field isn't going anywhere. This field is growing. It's growing so much that we are going to direct every single agency in the federal government to come up with a plan here. I think we take a step forward. But then you see we're a big government. We're a big system. We have states. We have local entities. So we take a step forward with the EO. And then we take some steps back sometimes too. And I think what I see as crypto founders are confused by that. They're starting to think, well, I could go to this jurisdiction where there's a single regulator. And you don't have 50 states with different rules. It's the US government that needs to start taking stock of the fact that right now, Emily in China, there's a quarter of a billion, ECNY wallets, a quarter of a billion. We're still talking about whether there should be a government central bank digital currency. We're still studying that. So you think we're going to fall behind the United States? I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind China. And then we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China and the rest of the world? This is years ahead. So I don't want people to take.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3227,2022-10-15 15:24:35
14942," I think we already are falling behind. Fall behind. And we're falling behind. What are the dangers of falling behind China? And the rest of the world. This is years ahead, so I don't want people to take a headline and say, oh, I think the US dollar will be, you know, no longer the global currency. Reserve global currency. I'm not saying that now. But fast forward decades. And if you no longer need to use the dollar because you have an alternative, I think that's a real problem. What would we use instead? Well, I think that there are going to be stable coins out there that people who have access to a smartphone will use. There is a demand for it. We see our 285% year-over-year growth with stable coins. So people are clearly liking the idea of this. Now, again, there have been some spectacular failures too, but not all stable coins are created the same. But I think the important thing is that we really do need to not just quash innovation. What do you think of how Gary Gensler, the chair of the SEC, and how he's approaching it? One of the things that I hear from founders is that they're very confused because they get told, come in, register. Just come in and talk to us. But you have the one company who's done the ultimate act of going in and registering coinbase, filed an S1. And still, you know, there's a lot of saber rattling still going on, I think. And again, I don't want to single out the SEC, you know, and I don't want to suggest that anything they're doing is bad. I do think, though, that right now there's a lot of confusion. And one of the pieces of confusion stems from the fact that, you know, and it started with the ICO, Mania back in what, 2016, 2017, I can't even remember which year now, where the SEC was very loud about securities. A lot of them were securities, but the space has changed, and so to still view it through the ICO lens when so much has happened over the last five years in the space, I think is a mistake. What do you have to say to the skeptics out there who just don't believe in the future of Web3? And don't see where this is going. Yeah. I would say don't judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I hear from a lot of these skeptics, and by the way, I'm friends with a lot of these skeptics too. I don't only want to live in a crypto bubble. They want to see the use cases, especially if they're not technical. Well, when am I going to use it? What will I use it for? And I think one of the things that's not appreciated is how quickly the infrastructure here is catching up. And once you have kind of a, once you have really scalable blockchains that can handle a lot of thorough put and are very efficient, I think that unlocks a whole lot of use cases. People are spending more time on screens. That curve is up and to the right. Whether we like it or not, that is the future. I mean, those who have kids know that kids spend more time online. They want digital things too. And I think to dismiss it, it is a bit generational. I do find. Not always, but it is a bit generational. If you talk to kids about being able to have money online, they instantly get that concept. They're comfortable not having to hold something in their hand to think it has value. Take us to the end state. Do Google and Amazon and Facebook and Apple still exist? I believe they will still exist. I mean, it depends what you talk about when you talk about the end state. I mean, I think that, you know, I think for decades, those companies will still be around. But the important thing is I think this new ecosystem is going to represent a challenge to them. I do think that those entities, decentralized forces are coming and we'll cut into those entities, profits and revenues. So we have a little rapid fire section. If you could belong to any altcoin tribe, that's what it be. Gosh. There is no way I'm answering that because I will get trolls on Twitter by every other altcoin tribe. I'm a crypto maximalist. I'm a crypto maximalist. All right. Well, I'm not picking one. Booker podcaster, Benjing now. Yeah. Okay. I'm, I, yes, I am. Gosh, I'm Benjing on WeatCrash. Something that brings you simple joy.

But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We've had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? You will put a woman on Mars. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. How are people doing a quite complex job? People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere. That's an easy. If you think about what all people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power. Rowing you profitability, investor interest. For the Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3229,2022-10-15 15:32:46
14944," Marky County, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020 with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's kind of like being counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important and she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem, they share it first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges and what should we do going forward? Do you post DHL Group consists of five divisions? Express. We have a company's post and parcel service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. We are now seeing that also another pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce, has taken a faster growth trajectory than anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. We see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. We also see that when we are talking to our customers now, I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. What the factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. We can't be successful.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3230,2022-10-15 15:37:18
14945," The revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organization. She says, you know, we can't be successful as a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by VEC program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say no when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person in that grade, if you have a CEO who is riskabrous, because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. If we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is, is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're actually heading into certainly in economic slowdown, maybe a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DPDHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3231,2022-10-15 15:41:42
14946," It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attended to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then, during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. I had no idea what it was about, but what they told me was quite interesting. I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing and I then wandered into a more mainstream find. I was a finance field here in the group becoming the CFO of our Dietary Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Malenny Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organization that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Cologne-Born Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything and digitalisation and well, you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros? Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in E-commerce.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3232,2022-10-15 15:45:54
14947," Of course, you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time, they came and said, hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity. We need this building. And of course, there are always debates. Does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on? Unfortunately, they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search, we are truly needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labor supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business that there's going to be less need for labor for workers? Well, you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example, when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they're doing here every day. We all have a set here in 2019-20. You know, we might get one-third less jobs in the current setup until 2030, if we digitalize the organization, but we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer than that. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey, people said, oh, you know, I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question in the town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The own, the biggest tank of our aircraft, but we also have short and medium and long-term visas and visit growth in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yeah, so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions and when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick in supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business since anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability and we had a long debate is it right to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030. There were pros and cons but that was a very intense discussion melody in IHART where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number, this is a right approach we convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are where we are seen as somebody who really commit that not that many companies who have quantified their future investment.

Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all time high, according to a study by Chris Colder Associates. And executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit naive not thinking about these challenges so much. So when I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like wear dark suits and white shirts and look alike, right? So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. So we are promoted and watch a print on Facebook, they all know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3234,2022-10-15 15:54:41
14949," I have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list. Because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO, Frank Appell says, Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions that you know, what I like about there, she is still you know, a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. I'm the hope that this has had positive impact for many others. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DPDHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DPDHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalization, sustainability, and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very agile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can pre-plan everything, that's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalization and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonization measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalization area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex. You can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO.

14950," You go get big new investments. And I'm not sure it's right or wrong. It just happens to be our way. And we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions. We ask if it's successful, can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach? And do we have confidence there? And if not, can we acquire quickly? If we like the answer to those questions, we'll go pursue it with a single threaded team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business. When it comes to the stock, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? I have never tried to predict what stocks might do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. I do really believe that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. And the ultimate output for a company is share price. And then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level. And that's where we spend all our time. And so if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors. And I expect that to be true again. MAZRO We will never be strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have the water rises and the mountains shake. All our will remain. We will never never never break. We will never break. We will never break. We will never break. We will never break. But a few she has been there with her camera at the majority of the conflicts in the 21st century. I want to hear about the stories behind those images Lindsay, thank you so much for joining me and joining all of our viewers. I know it's rare for you to be sitting in a seat safely away from what you're covering normally with your camera. You've come to the world's attention many times with your work over the years, but very recently, at the beginning of this year, in fact, just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine, you did come to the attention of many people because you took a photo of a Ukrainian family of for trying to cross a bridge who had been killed and that photo ended up on the front pages of the New York Times. Can you tell me a bit about how you came to that seat? So I went and I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately ended up safely and we are coming back.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3236,2022-10-15 16:03:27
14951," And I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately was covering sort of daily missile strikes and the destruction and those who had been killed and injured. And so one day I was watching images come out from the wires and others who went to the European bridge. And there were hundreds of civilians crossing the elderly, women, children crossing out of your peen and all of those suburbs. And so we made our way toward the bridge through side roads. And as we approached, the territorial defense soldiers were taking injured over to sort of a brick wall off to the side. So we ran across the street and almost as soon as we got behind that wall, a round came in. So it was either a mortar round or a tank shell, we're not sure. It came in and hit sort of off to the distance. And then the Ukrainian military fired back. And so my security adviser said, would you like to go? And I said no, because everyone knows this is a civilian evacuation route. And those rounds are probably going toward a Ukrainian base that's off in the distance. But how wrong I was. The next round came in closer. And so we dove for cover. And as soon as we popped back up, the next round came in right next to us essentially. And it was sort of equidistant between us and a mother and her two children. And a church volunteer that was helping us for them to safety. It was very chaotic. And obviously we were all sort of in shock because the round had landed very close to us. Everything was very dusty. And our security adviser immediately went to the aid of the injured and to a soldier who was nearby. And by the time he called us over, you know, the protocol is we wait to be told, you know, it's clear you can come. And so by the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured, but I anticipated it being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean, because nothing was shielded. So people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course, I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point. I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I, one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed, you know, something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. So we were, our security adviser Steve was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly. And we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces so that we had some options. Well, the image you, I'm talking about, certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way. Now you've said that the way that you look at the image. You can't see them. You can't see them. But it's more you look at the scene of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting as horrible as that sounds because obviously I've just witnessed the most devastating scene. But I'm also a photojournalist and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles. And frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3237,2022-10-15 16:07:41
14952," I was trying different angles and frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the United States ambassador to the United Nations to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted because I was there. I witnessed the run-up. And I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position.

They can kind of move to get out of the way of each other or change their orbit a little bit. It's a service that you guys offer to help these companies know how to maneuver their machines. Yeah, we offer a collision avoidance service. It's a subscription service. We'll send you an alert up to seven days in advance if your satellite is going to come dangerously close to a piece of debris or another satellite. Things have been doing that for decades moving satellites around, but it's sort of like a harder problem now. The risk of a collision is a lot higher now. Just because we've installed so much more hardware into space, you have a big collision. It creates a cloud of debris. And now all the other satellites are flying through this whizzing mess of debris as we add all of the new satellites into space. The risk of a collision, the likelihood of the collision is going up. You mentioned being a mother has that changed the job fee? Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that. For me, making decisions on a minute to minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going sort of all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps when you see an image, when you create an image, when you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you would have always affected you. I imagine. Always. Has it changed, though? Has changed. I think, you know, I photographed, I have photographed children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan in Somalia during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. And it was always devastating. But I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother. And I know, you know, I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. So you're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. And perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, are you, would you say you have become desensitized, though? No. Do you have to be in any way? No, not at all. I mean, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment. But you know, part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs and looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3238,2022-10-15 16:11:52
14953," focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs and looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional and that's okay. I mean, I, you know, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but, you know, I, I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think, I mean, you talked about hanging back because of the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front. And yet when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive when you know you're not where you need to be and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with because if I'm close and something happens a little closer, or a little further from me, but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think my, where I'm positioning myself is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. You know, if I hear that the school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. You know, if I hear that a building has been hit on the front line, but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although that building's been hit, but no civilians have been killed. I mean, this talks to the idea of not you per se, but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies trying to find the very worst to document. And being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? You know, for me, the highest hall of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie. That is documenting reality. And the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another and every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. And so I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presuming that for you in this work that you do, you don't always just cover war, you cover humanitarian disasters, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself, to your family, and to those who could be critical is that you are providing evidence. Yeah, and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others, of the actual killers before? Yeah, I mean, I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others, but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. You know, seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. You know, they obviously don't allow us access to things when they are killing civilians. You know, I think that there was a time in the Corangol Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd, me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times magazine, and the point was to understand the nuances of war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. And in fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Corangol Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency because he believed that journalists needed to understand sort of the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. And so we were in rock operation, rock avalanche, which was in the movie The Documentary Restrepo. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. And so we were in that operation where we've jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days, and eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. And we were ambushed from three sides, and there was a huge gun battle. Three soldiers were shot. One was killed. And in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers. Everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3239,2022-10-15 16:16:22
14954," I was standing with some of the soldiers, everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields. And he literally had me look through the scope of his gun. And there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness. And I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops and really was willing to risk my life and to be there in the middle of Operation Wakavelaange. A shot you took during that maneuver. We're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush where it's a very dusty picture. It is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rughal. And he's in a body bag. And it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is sort of leading the way, is crying. And they're walking through this very sort of desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? Years after 9-11, fighting in the middle of the mountains where there are no people. And it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind and for us to have a look at and talk about an 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship. That is in America, it's called the Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from Achilles to a scientist, to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work, because it was the first time I could decide not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research and I decided to focus on maternal mortality and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours and imagine being in labor, you know, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain. And there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. And we stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? And it turned out the woman on the right, Norene Soe was in labor. And Norene Soe's husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so determined to not lose her that he managed to get a car in the village. But when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. So I said, well, just get in my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Faisabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, OK, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road. Yeah. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly, and brought him back. And the whole family piled in my car and we took them to the hospital. And everyone asked me if she delivered safely and if I took photographs and yes, she delivered safely. But no, I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course of that story with my presence by taking them. So you took a photo. I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames. And that's when you had met. It's just like this.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3240,2022-10-15 16:20:50
14955," who thought maybe we were with the American occupation. We finally convinced them we were journalists. They held us until dusk and then eventually let us go. Obviously it was terrifying. We had guns to our heads for about 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally we had been two in each car, but one of the drivers' brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous a situation is. By the time we decided to pull back East toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Kedafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels we had been covering started opening fire on that checkpoint. So we were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me as the only woman, I was sort of left sitting there because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored. So I had to get out of the car because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the backseat and when I jumped out, one of Kedafi's troops sort of came to me and was pulling at my cameras instinctively. I was pulling back even though there were bullets literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind the sort of checkpoint building and we're all told to lie face down in the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said, you can't execute them. They're American, which this was all in Arabic and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. You know, in retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American because in the Middle East, a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded. And essentially for the next three days, we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution. And for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly, I was not raped, but of course in that time being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of ironically look to them for strength because I thought, well, if they survived it and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just minutes a minute? A minute to minute. I mean, in a kidnapping, there is no sort of an hour down the line. It is literally every second is survival mode. It is, what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? She's, I mean, it sounds like the scene from a film. And yet it's your life. And I believe Jennifer Lawrence has been interested in your life all the way. She was talking about the film. She was, we spent about three years together when Warner Brothers optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that called It's What I Do, a Photographer's Life of Love and War. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. What's it like taking Jennifer Lawrence to all sides? I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be, you know, to be close to a war zone. Obviously, we had to worry about her safety. So I couldn't take her. I'm not sure. Hey, but I worry about what I list though while you're dealing with it. It was very stressful. Let's just say when I put her on the plane to, you know, from Uganda, I couldn't walk for a week. My back went out. But yeah, but she eventually dropped out. OK. And so now it is being made into a limited series. OK. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. OK. OK.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3241,2022-10-15 16:29:28

She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. I think she got inspiration from it. But what have you learned that from being in these scenarios, coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah, I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness. The fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous. And yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered. But I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after. Well, thank you very much for taking us behind the lens with you. Thank you. Lindsay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye.

Jikoe who once ran a furniture business has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favor of downstream products will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory it's a salary much higher comparing with the other industry in the automatic industry higher, much higher. Higher than furniture. If Jikoe has his way other raw materials will follow, coal, boxite, tin, gold and copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jikoe is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jikoe of Indonesia. President Jikoe, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last here in 2019 you had just been re-elected. Now you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You know you are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. I suppose my first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Was it wise? Was it even responsible? The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. And I think not only Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. I think you are being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia and then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? Did I did that? No, no. We will openly receive but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan and there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan it would spill over into the South China Sea where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you are ready for that conflict militarily if it happens? We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved. The pandemic still exists in some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3243,2022-10-15 16:37:29
14958," can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the D20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. And President Putin. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? And you have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20 we do not want to add to conflict or problems but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. You know, you've been to Xi Putin, you've been to C. Zalensky, you've been to Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication. Even if it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem, it is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America. But having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. American investment in Indonesia over the past five years is nine billion dollars. China has invested 40 billion dollars. You know, you look around here. We have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China's, China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. Not not to be a real man, not to be a real man. So, by about. You are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, this will be the Batis-Ezambika. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You've dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first. He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Yeah, Galau Gitamoli, yeah. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries. It includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta, and there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include in Myanmar participation.

14959," One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to go and see Vladimir Putin and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the President of the G20? Yes, I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours, then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin and talk with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. So I turned to issues like food crisis and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin and President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the ships to enter Odessa. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the ships to enter Odessa. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security for the ships to enter Odessa. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will wind burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grow of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new but Indonesia's two-term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikoi is moving downstream creating higher-value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia. So there will be state income in form of tax. Provide jobs.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3245,2022-10-15 16:46:10
14960," We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. John, I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at 20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with box-side, copper, tin, crude, palm oil and others. We are not being closed. We are being open indeed. U.S., China, Europe, want to come and cooperate. We are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So they people have to use them here. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. We want us to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars as many as we can here in Indonesia. And box-side and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, box-side, for example, is used to produce alumina. But then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. OK, is this more beer chassis? You've talked about putting a tax on nickel products. The next stage up is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products? Yes, come on, Ginnan. It is possible to impose it this year. I can see around here you have had a lot of success. You and I went around a rather nice car factory and you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seamkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a $5 billion contract to supply nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hoped to get a Tesla battery facility. And I wondered if you could give us any news on that, is that any closer? If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of it. Well, that's just how it is. You made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? And still in discussion, let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. I don't know if it's possible. Do you think there has been an element, though? Again, looking around here, that it has just been, tends to be the Asian countries, which have been first into trying to build electric battery facilities here. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3246,2022-10-15 16:50:36
14961," In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. So the energy will come from green energy, such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600, flooded the domestic market, then you changed your mind. And partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country, but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yeah. At that time, the domestic market situation, there was a price spike of almost double, so we made a policy. There were several policies, but it didn't solve the problems for months on. So we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay. No problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that palm oil has to be offered to the domestic market first? Do you now want to get rid of that? Yeah. If going forward, the price is stable, we can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interest. Scalatic, Copantica Naciona, Tata, Camino, Brasadupa. Soring energy prices and a short supply of key chemicals that produce synthetic fertilizers are sending peak cow and horsemen in your prices, soaring. Even human waste is in demand, as farmers hunt for alternatives. Fertilizer helps increase crop yields. You can see how much moisture is held into this. It's a lot of organic material into the compost that breaks down the manure and the straw breaks down into a friable mix that can be mixed into soil in the ground and for growing a whole range of different vegetables. The nutrients in the water really increases the kind of bio-dynamic profile of the soil. The recent price spike could mean more farmers going organic for the long term. miel Compet blancissko. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060.

14962," They are a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. And I wonder, will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal-fired plants that has gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. 41% 2030 and 2060 we should be at zero, but this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. You're sticking to your pledge that there will be no new coal-fired power. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still on the process of being completed, not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51% of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. John, the forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016, it has been reduced by 85%. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years, we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangrove's forest. In the past five years, we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear? And countries that have already taken down their forests used their coal. And you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today. What we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Bagoor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year. And we will have 30 of those nurseries. Then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about New Centaura, this capital that you are building. $34 billion. The aim is to finish it by 2045. This would be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wondered, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Or are you on time in terms of that? I am on time. The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It is my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion. And we will use state budget to cover for 20%. While the rest, 80% from private sector, from investment. It isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept. And with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building New Centaura. That will happen long after you are supposed to give up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3248,2022-10-15 16:59:13
14963," easier, look at problems, look at challenges like building new centaura that will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular, you have a 68% approval rating and some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution but can you rule this out regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, new centaura first. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution I have said repeatedly I will abide by the constitution although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. President Jekowi, I'd like to say that you are still looking forward. Thank you very much for talking to me again.

Over much of the past three decades I've been an investor. The highest calling of mankind I've thought was private equity. And then I started interviewing. I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top. I asked him how much he wanted. He said 250. I said fine. It didn't negotiate with him. I did no due diligence. I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there. You don't feel inadequate now because being on the second wealthiest man abroad is that right? In recent decades one of the most important figures in Wall Street has been John Mack. He led Morgan Stanley for many years and led it through the financial crisis of 2007-2008.

14964," This from modest circumstance in North Carolina to become a dominant figure in Wall Street for quite some time. I sat down with John recently to discuss his life story and also what he sees as the future of Wall Street. So you spent more than 50 years on Wall Street and probably the most difficult time was during this 2007-2008 recession where Morgan Stanley came close to going under. Was that the most difficult time of your career? No question about it. I mean, we were on the brink of going out of business. And you thought you had a good cash reserve for a while, but then all of a sudden people started pulling cash out. Your cash reserves went down. How close did you come to actually going bankrupt? Well, we were very close, David, to the point that Tim Geithner, at the Fed, was trying to get us to sell to Jamie Diamond at the time. And he kept saying, that's what I want you to do. So I called Jamie and I said, look Geithner's all over me. He says, you'll buy the firm. He said, I don't want your firm. I said, well, go tell Geithner that. And he said, John, if he forced me to do it, I wouldn't pay you $2 a share. So that made it easy on me. I was not going to listen to them. And as a result, we called our board in and we're thinking we're going to go out of business. At one point, you're on a phone call with Ben Bernacki, the chairman of the Fed, Hank Paulson, Secretary of Treasury, and Tim Geithner, the head of the New York Fed. And they say you should file for bankruptcy. Right. And you slammed the phone down on them. Was that easy to do? For me, it was easy to do. I mean, thank God I left out some four letter words. I said, I'll take the firm down first and I hung up on them. Okay. I can't tell you why I did it because I'm my gut. It was the wrong thing to do. So now, after your retirement, you decided to write a book, which is a very good book. I read a post and all in about your life story. So how hard is it to sit down and write about your life and go through the good and the bad things that take you along with a long time to do this? And do you ever say, why did I agree to do this? No. No. I enjoy sitting down and working with the person who worked with me on the book. Look, I have a lot of memories and a lot of things that I did that that in talking with him, it came up of other things that I had done. So I enjoyed it. It was, I got along really well with my writer and Linda Coleman was just terrific. And we had fun doing it. So I enjoyed doing the book. So at the end of the book, you say something that I found to be surprising. You talked about the fact that you've recently been diagnosed with some cognitive impairment, which you say could lead to Alzheimer's. Correct. And why did you put that in the book? You didn't need to put that in. No, I didn't. Christian, I talked about it. And she said, look, John, you're always up front with people. You're writing this book, tell people the truth, tell them you're having some issues. So we talked about it and I agree that's the right thing to do. I mean, I didn't put it in there for sympathy. I didn't put it in there for, you know, come over and give me a hug. I just think my personality has been up front. I tell people what's going on. I did that when I ran Morgan Stanley. I did it at Credit Suisse, even though Suisse didn't like me very much for doing it. I did it at Credit Suisse. That's who I am. I'm up front. I tell people what's going on. Look, it happens. You say that maybe you thought he came from your football injuries, or maybe you fell off an ATV. Right. But in hindsight, is it more of a genetic kind of thing do you think, or the doctors don't really know? Well, the doctors don't know if it's genetic. I mean, my mother did have Alzheimer's. I just think you need information. Look, I hope my cognitive skills last a long time, but life's life and just live it. And I don't think trying to hide things. You know, if you are, if you and I didn't know each other like we know each other, we're out to dinner, I don't want you to say, John, you just told me that three minutes ago. I want to put a little warning out there. Give me a break. I may repeat myself. And I cover myself by saying, I may have already told you this. Now, Christie is your wife of more than 50 years as well? 49 years of. 49 years of November. Okay. So, where did you meet her? I met her through Charlie Rose. So, Charlie Rose and I were at Duke University. He was a couple of years ahead of me. And here.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3250,2022-10-15 17:08:50
14965," Where did you meet her? I met her through Charlie Rose. So Charlie Rose and I were at Duke University. He was a couple of years ahead of me. And he had moved in New York, and I was in New York working at Smith Barney at the time. And he called me up and said, you know, my wife's sister's coming up. We'd like you to take her out. I thought about it a little bit and got a date for Friday night and calling it back and said, okay, we'll go out Saturday night. And I got to their apartment on 96th Street. Mary was a beautiful woman. And Christie walked in. She took my breath away. Not only beautiful, but had a great smile. She was very warm, very friendly. If it wasn't love at first sight, it was pretty close. Let's talk about your background. So you grew up in North Carolina, but your grandfather immigrated from Lebanon, is that right? But why did he go to North Carolina? Was there a big Lebanese community there? Did he intend to go to another place? There was a big Lebanese community in South Carolina. And he was going to go to Mary in South Carolina when he got off Ellis Island. And he ended up in Mary in North Carolina. He stayed the night in the train depot. No one came to pick him up. So finally, the conductors said, get on the podium on the train and took him to Charlotte, North Carolina on that train. And there was a Arabic family around a coffee shop at the train station. And they talked about the mix up. They gave him a job, started washing dishes, then it became a peddler. Then he went back and got the rest of his family. And they'd made enough money to get a wagon. And they went in the countryside selling cloth, sewing materials, shoes, stuff like that. And then that evolved into John Mackin's sons. John Mack was my grandfather's name. And it was a clothing department store. And my father, who was an entrepreneur, decided he wanted to be totally on his own. And he started wholesale grocery business. And so they wanted you to go in that business at some point? I don't think my father did. My mother was a very strong force. She only wanted to be a doctor. And I really didn't want to be a doctor. My father was laid back. And my mother was really aggressive. It was a great combination. So you were a high school football star? Well, I don't know about a star, but I was a good football player. I thought you were all state. That's pretty good. I'll stay. You've done your homework. OK, so all states. So you get a scholarship to Duke University to play football. And what happened to your career at Duke? Well, I thought it was a good football player job. I got to Duke. They had some great players. And then in my sophomore year, I was a red shirt for one year. Then I was on like the second team. But I broke C6 in my neck. I cracked it. And what happened every time I would tackle someone, my left arm inside would go dead. So Frank Bassett, who's one of the orthopedic surgeons, who used to be at Duke, called the AD and said, this young man's football career is over. He has a bona fide injury. He cannot play football any longer. So that ended my football career. But once you're on a scholarship, I still had to work there. So I was a manager, getting towels and setting up trips when I go play. One of the teams in Florida or one of the teams in the Big 10. So when you graduated, did you say, I want to go to Wall Street and be the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Now, when I graduated, I need one course to finish Duke University. My scholarship had expired. So I got a job in a local brokerage firm called First Securities in North Carolina. So that got me involved in the securities business. And there was a lady there named Fannie Mitchell. And maybe you remember, she ran the job placement office at Duke University. So when the recruiters would come down, she would say, there's one guy you got to meet. It's John Mack. And I would meet these recruiters and got a number of job offers. And then I decided that I like the securities business. Smith Barney wanted to open an office at that time in Atlanta. They offered me a job. And I told them. While testlers and the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3251,2022-10-15 17:13:21
14966," While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burned fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels, we want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. We want this, Marty. What did you do there? Were you like a registered investment? Yes, exactly. I mean, we started out in a train class and I got my brokerage license and then I was approached by the head of the municipal bond division. Why don't you come into the bond business? And I really didn't want to go down to open an office in Atlanta or down in Florida. So I took that job. So I got into bond business and I was a trader on the bond desk of the municipal's. And then at some point that led Smith Barney of getting into the corporate bond market and I transitioned over to corporate bonds. And then from there they told me they would put me on commission, which they never did. And I got approached by a small boutique firm called Smithers, which was really known for their bond acumen and their bond business. So I went over and became a salesman doing corporate securities, corporate bonds at Smithers and companies. I've often thought to be a good trader. You have to be pretty quick in your head with numbers to make sure you get the numbers right. Is that true? Or you really? No, that is true, but I think as a salesman, much more so than a trader, that business, it's a commodity business about relationships. So if you can build a relationship with your clients where they trust you and they go to you when they have business to do, that's how you become successful. Okay, so how did Morgan Stanley hear of you and say you should join what was then considered a white shoe firm and probably hadn't hired a lot of Lebanese back traders before, right? Well, it's a good story. So I met with Dick Fisher, who was running that initiative to build a secondary bond business. And we went back and forth and I said, I'm flattered that you would all do your job. But I don't believe a Lebanese heritage from North Carolina who went to Duke University has a chance at making it Morgan Stanley. And he said, well, you're wrong. And if you think you come over here and you're right when you quit Howard Reson, I'm telling you you're wrong, this is a meritocracy and you should join us. It convinced me. So in those days, Morgan Stanley was a private partnership, not a public company. And it was a company that basically underwrote, let's say AT&T bonds, but it didn't actually go out and sell. It was priceome and other people would sell them. So Morgan Stanley said, we're now going to change that and you became a trader for Morgan Stanley. I became a salesman at Morgan Stanley. That's what they need. So you did that for a while and then at some point, people give you more authority and you get to be in management. Did you want to be in management or did you like to be a trader or salesman? No, I like success. So I thought the right way to go is managing being a manager and that's what I wanted to do. So whether there's a lot of disagreement if I were any good and not very good, I liked it and I thought I was pretty good at it. So you rose up and you ultimately are offered the position of being the CEO of Morgan Stanley? Well, yeah, eventually. There were a lot of blocks.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3252,2022-10-15 17:17:01
14967," So you rose up and you ultimately are offered the position of being the CEO of Morgan Stanley. Well, yeah eventually But there were a lot of Blocks along the way to do that. But then all of a sudden you decided you needed to do a merger with Dean Witter Right, and why did you need to do that? Well Dean Witter was owned by Sears and they had decided to spin it off and We had Morgan Stanley got the order from Sears to do this Transaction to raise money in an equity transaction So when we met with Phil Purcell and talked about all their salesmen their branch offices It became apparent to me and also to Dick Fisher that this is the way to really build the franchise because Distribution is going to be more and more important and To have a connection with retail clients would be important and that's how we made the decision There was push back in the firm, but with Parker Gilbert and Dick Fisher's leadership We were able to convince the partners. This is the right thing to do and we did it Here firm was a leading Wall Street firm. You could argue Dean Witter was a so-called Main Street firm Correct and putting the two together had never been done like that before correct and How did you negotiate who was going to be the CEO? Well at that time Dean Witter owned discover card so their market cap was dramatically larger than ours So we based it on market cap and they had a much larger market cap to do the deal Purcell wanted to be in charge that was one of the pre-requisites to do the deal that he'd be the CEO And I'd be the president of the firm and we did that deal All right She did that deal and being president under somebody else was a step back You could argue though. It's a bigger firm. How long did that last? That's a good question. I know it didn't last too long Ultimately you said I've had enough of this and you didn't like his style and you write about that in your book Yeah, but you ultimately said okay. I'm out of here and right so unemployed Yeah, and you tell your wife guess what your husband's unemployed No, my wife is so supportive. I got to told her anything and she would she's on my side. It was great You know, I ended up at one point kind of going to a hedge fund and work with art Sandberg and I did that for a while but I was really flexible and I Think they call him the grumpy old men who went after the existing management at Morgan Stanley and felt like they were losing their edge and also their Reputation as a really great investment bank and really led by Parker Gilbert and Louis Bernard and some of the senior Partners who had retired and they owned a lot of stock and they put a lot of pressure on Dean Word of Morgan Stanley to make a change and that's how I ended up going back so Phil Purcell was Alsted right and then they came to you and to your surprise They said come back and be the CEO you hadn't known that you were gonna be asked correct I didn't know that at all so what was it like when you came back to where there people cheering for you when you came back into Morgan Stanley? You seen the film Yes, for a young person who now is looking at a career would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David yeah, listen They're not many jobs you're gonna have as a young individual If you're always always learning So what's the best investment advice you've ever given by anybody?

So really a reminder, isn't it? Just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade. We did see some pressure on the U.S. and we did see some pressure on the futures. That is now being reversed. So how did you build Morgan Stanley where you focused on underwriting, trading, other areas that were new to Wall Street? Well, I focused on what we did really well. And what we really did extremely well was build relationships with corporations and CEOs. We were either number one or number two in the M&A tables every year. So that was very important. And then we said, look, if we're going to be doing M&A and we have these wonderful relationships and trust, let's move into the secondary market and become a very active security business. So we ended up building a very large platform at the institutional level. And over time, with Dean Witter, you had the retail. So we really focused on being an institutional firm with a very strong retail base. Your predecessor, Phil Purcell, was famous for not meeting with a lot of people. He was a little isolated. Some people accused him of being. You like to be in the trading floor, near the trading floor, being with customers all the time, or with your employees, is that right? Yes. And so if you found people that were ignoring their clients or ignoring their employees, people working for you, you tended to tell them what you thought. Without question. What I did when I was running the division, fixing come division, I would sit out on the trading floor and have, I had a glass booth office. So if I had to have a conversation with someone, so going off in the conference room, we could sit in this glass office and we'd have a conversation. And I would be on the phones. I'd walk around and sit down by the best salesman or the worst salesman. What are you working on? What are your clients doing? I was always involved. And I had some really fun times in doing it. I think in my book, I talk about how you treat people. And I get off the elevator at 8 o'clock in the morning or 7.45. And you look over to the right and their delivery guys bring in coffee and examin' which is a way of you to do for breakfast. And about 20 minutes later, I walk back and I go out on the trading floor, and I go up to the sky and I said, how long have you been here? He said, about 30 minutes, he's a Hispanic, about 30 minutes. I said, if you call the person to order breakfast, you said, yes, I've called them three times. I said, give me the number. So I gave it a number and I said, this is John Mack, don't you get your ass out here? And it comes out in front of the delivery guy and I said, look, we're no better than he is. He's just trying to make a living. When you make him wait, you take money out of his pocket if I ever hear about it again, you're fired. That went around the floor like that. You don't treat people that way. And I hope that's ingrained in me before I went to Morgan Stanley, but I really learned it from Dick Fisher. He was such a gentleman and very smart and made decisions. So the person that you almost fired, did he do that again or? No, he did do it again. No one did it again. So Morgan Stanley is doing quite well and Morgan Stanley is competing principally with Goldman Sachs, I guess, was your main rival. And then all of a sudden...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3254,2022-10-15 17:25:43
14969," No one did it again. So Morgan Stanley is doing quite well, and Morgan Stanley is competing principally with Goldman Sachs. I guess it was your main rival. And then all of a sudden, we go into a recession 2007, 2008. So what happened was, as I remember from that period of time, and from reading your book, you had this large cash reserve, and you wanted to make sure you had a lot of cash, but people were afraid of Morgan Stanley maybe going under. So they said, give me my cash back. I'm gonna put it in JP Morgan. It's exactly right. And so all of a sudden, the cash is going all the way down. Right. At some point, you say, maybe we're not gonna make it. That's exactly right. Well, thank God for the Japanese, is what I can say. What I learned is it goes back to when Morgan Stanley would bring brokers from whether Namiura or Sumitomo didn't make any difference, and they would, in a training program, at Morgan Stanley. And the Japanese who came through that training program, respected the culture of Morgan Stanley. So when we were on the brink, they stepped up and gave us the money to stand business. So it turned out to be a good investment for Mitsubishi, because your stock has flourished since then. And after that happened, did you think that Wall Street learned any lessons, and do you think this could happen again, where you have enormous illiquidity problems or liquidity problems, and Wall Street really has changed very much? Well, I think the business of Wall Street hasn't changed that much, but the scrutiny on capital. And capital solvency is very, very focused. And I think the Fed does a much better job in paying attention to the liquidity of these investment banks. Also, I think boards of directors have elevated risk management to a level that never existed when I was there. So going through a near-death experience that we went through and other firms, in some cases they actually died, like, George Lee, Lehman Brothers. Boards focus on risk management. It's not about what deal you did, it's not about where we're gonna open another branch off, it's about liquidity and solvency. So after this happened, and Morgan Stanley comes back and is doing quite well, you ultimately decide to retire. Right. And you handed the reins over to James Gorman, who had not been a lifer at Morgan Stanley, and in fact he had come from Maryland, you had recruited him from there. And he was a consultant, not a trader, not investment banking person. So was that controversial to give it to him? If it were confident, I never heard about anyone saying, I mean, how could you do that? James is smart, he knows the business. He spent time as a consultant, time at Maryland. I saw how you ran the business, I retailed business at Morgan Stanley. He was on the management committee. I got a chance to see his interface. I would go up once a week and spend time in the office up in Westchester to be with him and how he managed. Smart as he can be, can make a decision, doesn't suffer fools. And he has a great personality, he was a natural. So for a young person who now is looking at a career, would you recommend a Wall Street career today? David, yeah, listen, there are not many jobs you can have as a young individual where you're always, always learning. It may be not something you can write, but Wall Street lives on the news. And what people are doing and what are the trends? I don't know many businesses like that. If you go in the manufacturing business, you have a sales cycle, you hope it's doing well. But in Wall Street, you have data every day that tells you, not only what's going on in this country, what's going on in the world. So as you look at your career, what do you think you're the most proud of having gone, helped with New York Presbyterian, helped Morgan Stanley recover from some of his problems? What are you most proud of? I'm most proud of where Morgan Stanley came from, just a few hundred people to where it is now. I think taking the risk we took during the Dean Wooder trade, having the bumps that we had to live with, it turned out to be an unbelievable investment bank with a great culture. And to have James Gorman running it now, I couldn't be happier more proud of it. So in hindsight, if you had to do it all over again, would you have gone to medical school as your mother wanted or you're happy you became a Wall Street person? To my mother's disappointment, thank God I came to Wall Street.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3255,2022-10-15 17:30:26
14970," And you thank God I came to Wall Street. So is there more pressure when you're trying to win a basketball championship than when you're trying to please investors? Where's the greater pressure? I think it's definitely trying to win a championship. Because when you invest and you know this, when you're investing you can control a lot more things. When in a basketball court you can't control whether somebody's going to make a shot, you've got to get lucky. And what's the greater pleasure making five times your money on a distressed debt investment or winning the NBA championship? They're both fabulous. I wish I could do one each year that would be great. I think there's a great feeling in being right on an investment that you've done a tremendous amount of work and you've made money for your clients which I think is great. I think winning a championship is a very surreal feeling because there's a whole city or state that is actually behind you. We had 70,000 people at the finals and we had them all outside. It's 17,000 in stands and then literally like 60,000 people outside. And when we won, like just the joy that you had brought to the city was phenomenal.

They have their opinions. They're very entrenched opinions. Neither side are going to change. And because of that, it becomes just very heated and emotional, very, very quickly. I mean, that sounds like good content. It's just, it's like watching a presidential debate. Like, maybe there's going to be some zingers or like some viral moments, but it doesn't feel like we're actually discussing it. So you think nobody changes their mind? I don't think so. Okay, we're not going to try to necessarily change anyone's mind today. Okay. But we want to give everyone all the information that they need to sort of understand Bitcoin and energy. Wow! Bitcoin uses a lot of energy. And the experts say crypto uses more power each year than Argentina. The energy it takes to process one single Bitcoin transaction could power the typical American home for more than 50 days. Bitcoin is so energy intensive because it relies on miners. High-powered computers that process transactions. These attempts to solve really complex problems and then get rewarded in the form of Bitcoin when they succeed. And more computers are trying to do this. The amount of computing power.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3256,2022-10-15 17:34:02
14971," When they succeed, and more computers are trying to do this. The amount of computing power needed to process transactions hit a record earlier this year. Miners are trying to lower their carbon footprint by using renewables, but the share of renewables used to power bitcoin's network actually fell between 2020 and 2021. All of this is happening at a time when the world is seeing one of its worst energy crises in decades. And it raises quite a few big questions. Is there an eco-friendly way to power crypto? And perhaps even more importantly, should energy even be going to crypto while the world struggles to keep the lights on? Alex, it's good to see you. Thanks for joining us. So, it's not really in dispute that crypto uses a lot of energy. That bitcoin uses a lot of energy. I think that the dispute, the argument is that it's not worth it to use a finite resource for something like cryptocurrency. But what would you say to somebody who says, no, I believe in the promise of crypto. And it is worth it for us to actually spend a finite resource like energy, mining it and on maintaining it. I would indeed agree that if any amount of energy is being spent, you always have to look at what do you ultimately get back from that. And the thing is when we look at the bitcoin network, we know that it is a digital currency, a payment system. And we also know that it is a payment system that is currently handling about 100 million transactions a year. So, that means that it's actually not handling more than a handful of transactions per second and that's it. Which is completely negligible if you look at it from a regular world of finance perspective, because the traditional financial institutions are responsible for handling more than 700 billion digital payments every year. And that amount is still growing. So, I mean, that's an amazing stat, but to be totally honest, part of the reason I don't like having conversations about energy is because, and bitcoin and crypto's energy uses is because on both sides, it sort of devolves into a toxic conversation is what I found. And I found that there's a lot of bad faith arguments on both sides. And I know that you're deeply rooted in the numbers, in the actual facts. But what's your best sense about why people get so emotional over these numbers? Well, it's not that hard to see why that is the case. We see that a lot of people have invested their money in bitcoin and we see that this type of data reflects extremely poorly on bitcoin. And well, actually, to the extent where we see that China took action to completely ban cryptocurrency mining from their country in the spring of 2021. The European Union almost banned bitcoin trading in the EU a few months ago. And actually, the White House just released a report that also recommended, consider potentially eliminating cryptocurrency mining. So, of course, with a lot of people having invested in this, they definitely won't like this whole discussion, definitely not if that's going to result in outright ban. It's hard to have a conversation about energy and crypto's use of energy without talking about the Ethereum merge. Of course, the transition from that blockchain, from proof of work to proof of stake, which of course is much less energy intensive. Could that be the green solution for the industry broadly beyond just Ethereum? Well, I think so. I mean, if you run on proof of stake or, well, I must say, it's not the only alternative to the process that is responsible for so much energy consumption in bitcoin, but it is definitely the most popular alternative. In any case, let me just say, if you make use of proof of stake, you can probably get away with using something like 10,000 times less power than you would need if you were to run on proof of work. So, just changing that part of the software can lead to incredible energy savings and we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3257,2022-10-15 17:38:36
14972," That part of the software can lead to incredible energy savings and we see that there are many cryptocurrencies already available in the market that are running on Poofos take and have been running on Poofos take for years. So if you do that and if that becomes the standard for the industry then a big part or almost the entirety of the energy consumption we're talking about could be solved. Alex Devreys thank you so much for joining us. Very welcome. If I can say one thing is I have we talked about Poofos take but we didn't really bother to explain anything. Have we just mentioned that it could save a lot of energy? Is that something you might want to spend a few extra words on like why is it even possible to save so much energy if you do that but it's a bit of a lengthy explanation and maybe too technical but yeah. Can it be in 30 seconds? Do you think like in a way that's digestible for normal people? In 30 seconds. Well digestible maybe 30 seconds challenging. Challenging eh? Well when you have it scripted by a Bloomberg journalist and thrown in a teleprompter it's actually pretty easy. So in under 30 seconds here's the difference. In proof of work super powerful computers owned by miners compete to be the first to unlock a cryptographic puzzle. After multiple attempts using lots of energy one miner solves the puzzle. If they're first they get a token and a transaction is recorded. Proof of stake dispenses with the problem solving removing excessive energy use. Instead transactions are approved by participants who put up coins as guarantees of their work and if that work is validated you get a reward. If it isn't you don't. See? Wasn't so hard. Just trying to be with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah my night. Yeah he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend?

14973," I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. We've had sort of a shift in our wean sort of sideflation fears moment people were talking about that all day yesterday. Zach Bradford, CEO and president of CleanSpark with us now in studio. What's interesting about CleanSpark is it sounds a little bit like an oxymoron, a sustainable bitcoin mining operation. What does that actually mean in practice? How do you fulfill that sustainable check mark? Our focus on sustainability really comes down to both sustainable energy but also sustainable business practices and how we interact with the community. So for us, energy is a big deal around bitcoin. We approach it with the acknowledgement that energy is a feature and not a flaw. And we focus on sustainably interacting with the grid but also we use about 90% carbon free power with a goal of ultimately getting to 100% at some point in the future. But it takes time. We think that being part of the transition is what matters. Getting from point A to point B and in a sustainable process. What is carbon free power? So carbon free power can come in many forms. It can be solar, it can be wind. We actually use a lot of nuclear energy which puts off no carbon into the atmosphere. So those are kind of the cornerstone of the energy sources with that we use. Do you also tell us about the role of carbon offsets because I know that there are a lot of miners who do use carbon offsets. How much of that is part of your business model? We're very little. So again, we focus on the source. So we're only using about 10% of the power as any sort of carbon off put right now. It can be a strategy, right? But not all renewable energy credits or carbon offsets are created equal, right? So anything that we do, we try and go through mechanism that results in new solar generation being added to the grid. So that's the only one that we participate in right now. Do you buy power that is carbon free or are you actually generating it yourself? We are buying power. So you don't have your own solar arrays or anything? Not right now we don't. We are adding a solar array to one of our facilities in the near future, but it'll still just be part of what it is. So we connect directly to the grid in the areas we operate. I want to get existential. A question that I have about the Bitcoin mining industry because there's a lot of pressure on the entire industry right now. And then you layer on the need or the push to become sustainable. It feels like it's fallen way down the priority list because there's a lot of miners who are just trying to stay in business right now. And in this path to a sustainable, a green Bitcoin mining future, how much has that timeline been pushed out? I think it's actually been shortened in some ways because it's actually getting more important. Some of the conversations are actually leading to quicker change. So depending on how you pull the industry, but it's estimated that about 60% of the power used by the industry is already renewable or carbon free. Now that still leaves a big gap to close, but if you were to compare it to any other industry, we're actually doing a lot better in most cases. What would you say to someone who says, okay, electricity is still a finite resource, even if we're getting it from renewable sources. And they just don't think it's a good use of energy to be mining crypto. They would rather that energy be used for keeping the lights on or running air conditioning in hot places. I would say, look at the regions that miners are operating in. Miners focus on finding cheap power. It's part of our strategy. We operate a lot in Georgia where there's actually abundant power. So would I-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3259,2022-10-15 17:47:18
14974," Focus on finding cheap power. It's part of our strategy, right? And, you know, we operate a lot in Georgia where there's actually abundant power. So, would I say it would be a good use to come into California, which has a very, you know, the grid is unstable and under a lot of stress and open up Bitcoin mine. Probably not. But ultimately, if you do it in Georgia or a few other places like that, where there is abundant energy, we're actually focusing on using the underutilized resources that do exist and then adding to the generation. So, again, you have to think of it as a transition about what we can add. I have a series of simple questions. Yeah. If we can go there. Let's talk about the Ethereum merge. The switch from proof of work to proof of stake. We've all seen the headlines that it cuts Ethereum's power usage down by 99% or something. Why can't Bitcoin just go to proof of stake? It seems like a pretty easy solution. Well, I would point to, again, proof of work is, and the energy it uses is a feature, not a flaw. Again, proof of work. What is Bitcoin? You know, there is no CEO of Bitcoin. It's fully decentralized. And really, proof of work is really the only good way to truly secure a blockchain without an overseer. And that has value because Bitcoin is used worldwide as a currency without, you know, somebody changing the mechanism. What creates that value is ultimately, there's only going to be 21 million Bitcoin ever. So, somebody can't just decide, tomorrow, hey, there's going to be 40 million. It's kind of like, you know, we're all experiencing what the Fed's doing right now to kind of pull back from inflationary money printing that won't happen in Bitcoin. But that reminds me of another simple question I have. 21 million Bitcoin will ever only be mined. We're at 19 million now, I believe. What happens to the miners when we got to 21 million? They will essentially live off of very small fees. So think of Visa, Master, Card, Amic. These are all companies that are very large and functioned very well on actually very small incremental fees. That's what will happen. But, you know, that doesn't happen until 2140. So every four years, there's a half thing. So basically, the reward right now gets cut in half every four years. So even though you say, oh, there's only two million left, how do we get to where it's 120 years before the reward runs out? By that time, the expectation is that Bitcoin essentially truly functions as a worldwide currency and the small fractional transaction fees can be support all miners. So you've even started planning for that yet? We have not started planning for 2140. 2140 or 2140? So 120 years from now. We're still talking about Bitcoin. Yeah, exactly. You know, I think we're all going to be fine. And everybody will be using Bitcoin there. So if we think about crypto mining compared to mining of natural resources, a lot of the competitive advantage has to do with location. So, you know, DeBierre says great access to diamonds and Rio Tinto. Perhaps in the US has great access to copper, whether or not they can get it is a different story. What's the competitive advantage for Bitcoin miners for your company? Yeah. And it is partially location, right? So for example, we have four facilities in Georgia. And the reason we chose these are the ones you guys recently bought. Yeah, yeah. We've had, you know, we've been operating in Georgia since 2020. We recently did by two more. And these areas where we're at is we're kind of on grid edge areas, areas where there's actually access infrastructure, access energy that's not being used. And because they used to be a factory or something like that. So yes, it allows us to get good rates on power. But we're also bringing back to communities, you know, workforces, factories that used to be there are closed. So we have a workforce that's ready to go. We have energy that's ready to go and lower rates. But couldn't any miner do that? Yes, you know, absolutely. And to the point that you recently made a few acquisitions when you brought it out and look at the broader industry, in this moment where we've gone through a big downturn, would you expect more?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3260,2022-10-15 17:51:59
14975," We recently made a few acquisitions when you brought it out and look at the broader industry. In this moment where we've gone through a big downturn, would you expect more consolidation between some of these miners? Absolutely. You know, for us, we saw this big opportunity, but you had to have a healthy balance sheet, you had to not be over leverage. You had to be ready for this downturn. It's something that we've been preparing for for a long time. And so the miners, and we're not the only one, the miners that have prepared, there's definitely going to be some consolidation in the space. Can you explain, because Katie and I've talked about this a lot, and I don't know if anyone really has been able to answer this for us. When we think about mining, if we take it back to pulling natural resources out of the ground, that's clear to understand how somebody gets gold or oil or copper out of the ground. Bitcoin miners don't just find new Bitcoin. They also help keep the Bitcoin network running. Yes. Can you explain the difference between discovering new Bitcoin versus maintenance on the network? Yeah. So, really what we're doing all the time is we're processing data. So we have tens of thousands of computers processing data. And what that data ultimately is, is it's locked by a cryptographic key. And that's what our machines are trying to guess. And so they're putting in all this effort to do that. But ultimately, when you get a block, so what is the block? The block is the ledger of all the transactions that got recorded. So if you sent Bitcoin to your brother or whatever it may be, right? That ledger has to then be compared to all the ledgers before it. And so all of this work is going in to make sure that it's secure, and that block doesn't get placed without verifying everything behind it. And if there's an error, then the block doesn't get placed. You also don't get the reward. Do you actually need to be on the grid? And couldn't you find a spot in the Mojave Desert that during the day, it's hot and it's sunny, and it provides solar power. And then at night, it's windy, so you can get wind power. So you could, you know, in a perfect world, be running 24-7. Couldn't you just be self-sustained? Absolutely, you could. And but I would also argue that then you're providing your own benefit with that energy, right? I think there's true, and this is how we've always set up the company. There's true ancillary benefits to the grid that provide value. We actually operated out of California for the first six years of our business, not as a cryptocurrency mining company, but as a renewable energy company. That's how we got into the space. And what we found is the interaction with the grid was incredibly important. We had software that would do that. And at scale, though, you start to run into these interesting issues to where, you know, renewables going onto the grid at the wrong times of the day is actually causing a problem for California. There's too much power hitting the grid. Well, the sun is shining and everybody's at work, and they're not using all their power at their home. When they go home at night, the sun goes down. They turn their TV on, they turn their AC on. Monsome big. Yeah. Whatever they may be doing. And now there's not enough energy at that moment. So it was about balancing the time the energy's available, not available. And so, you know, really interacting with the grid, we see it's important. Because if we do a behind the grid project, or behind the meter project where we're self-generating wind and solar, yes, it means that we're only using renewables and we're not impacting the grid, but it means we're not helping the grid. So it's definitely one way to do it. But it's not the way that we've approached it because we want to drive change at the entire grid level. We really think that our sustainable strategy should provide a benefit to everyone around us. And it's me who, you know, for the sake of argument, just a total cryptoskeptic, that we shouldn't be spending any energy on cryptocurrency. That it should all go toward, you know, actually essential things that we need power for. Like this lightboard behind me that probably doesn't use much energy because it's LED, but you get the idea. Yeah. I would point to the fact that that energy that we're using is generally already available. But it's no one's using it. And so you think of, you know, I'm going to point to, you know, one of the communities we operate in, okay? They have a goal to transition off of coal. And they're in the process of doing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3261,2022-10-15 17:56:34
14976," To, you know, one of the communities we operate in, okay? They have a goal to transition off of coal. And they're in the process of doing so. Where's this? This is in Georgia, okay. It's actually in College Park. It is the same city that serves the Jackson Hearts Field Airport. We operate there. And we are working with them to help them transition away from any reliance, right? And this has been a multi-year strategy for them. It's not that there isn't enough power. And I think that that's a mindset that we can change. Is power is abundant. It's around us. It's about how it's harnessed. And if we're there to pay for it all the time, we can help support grid infrastructure, which in this country, we need to invest a lot in grid infrastructure. But why do you have to be mining Bitcoin to do that? I guess what I'm still not hearing is like the argument about the argument. And this is the argument that totally bothers you, I think, of why Bitcoin should exist. Well, let me ask, what else is it going to be used for? And how, I'm going to put myself as the utility now, right? When in Georgia it's been a hot summer. When the power prices are peaking, that also means demand is peaking. We shut off. All that power goes back into the community. We can actually help reduce power rates in communities, because being a large buyer, if it's not being purchased when it's off peak, then that means that they have to take those dollars, and they have to put them back into the community somewhere. And so we're actually able to do all of those things. So we're really providing a grid service in addition to everything else. So the question is, why Bitcoin? I would say point to another asset or another business that's willing to do that. Come on the grid off the grid and really interact in a way that balances both the grid and the power itself, but also balances the monetary system behind utilities. And you can't find one.

The Reichstag does stand out because, first of all, it's an energy manifesto. So it transforms something that was dependent on fossil fuels that uses all the technology to produce something which is essentially carbon neutral. And there's a public building. That's a statement. It's a symbol of a city. It's a symbol of a nation. It incorporates works of art. It's a symbol of a nation, a country, and a country. It's a symbol of a nation.

It's a symbol of a city, a symbol of a nation, it incorporates works of art, it's recycling and existing building which as I mentioned earlier is the ultimate in sustainability, if you can, if you can give a new life to a building. It also creates public space at the roof level, it is the most visited parliament in the world, so it puts the public above the politicians who are answerable to them and that of course was made possible by the politicians, so it's a demonstration of democracy in action. We hope to show independence in every sector at the citizens school in order to preserve civil rights. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And there are scientists who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it, or a government, they can build it. We'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading out of space, really change our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. My guest this week is the Pulitzer Prize-winning American photographer, Lindsay Adario. Ukraine, Afghanistan, South Sudan, to name but a few, she has been there with her camera at the majority of the conflicts in the 21st century. I want to hear about the stories behind those images and what it's like living, working, existing on the front lines of these walls. Lindsay, thank you so much for joining me and joining all of our viewers. I know it's rare for you to be sitting in a seat safely away from what you're covering normally with your camera. You've come to the world's attention many times with your work over the years, but very recently, at the beginning of this year, in fact just a few weeks after the war started in Ukraine, you did come to the attention of many people because you took a photo of a Ukrainian family of for trying to cross a bridge who had been killed. And that photo ended up on the front pages of the New York Times. Tell me a bit about how you came to that seat. So I went and I went directly to the east and was covering the east for about 10 days before the war started. When the war began, I went to Kiev and immediately was covering sort of daily missile strikes and the destruction and those who had been killed and injured. And so one day I was watching images come out from the wires and others who went to the Irpin Bridge. And there were hundreds of civilians crossing the elderly, women, children crossing out of your peen and all of those suburbs. And so we made our way toward the bridge through side roads.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3263,2022-10-15 18:04:36
14978," men, children crossing out of your peen and all of those suburbs. And so we made our way toward the bridge through side roads. And as we approached, there were injured, the territorial defense soldiers were taking injured over to sort of a brick wall off to the side. So we ran across the street and almost as soon as we got behind that wall, a round came in. It was either a mortar round or a tank shell, we're not sure. It came in and hit sort of off to the distance. And then the Ukrainian military fired back. And so my security adviser said, would you like to go? And I said no, because everyone knows this is a civilian evacuation route. And those rounds are probably going toward a Ukrainian base that's off in the distance. But how wrong I was. The next round came in closer. And so we dove for cover. And as soon as we popped back up, the next round came in right next to us essentially. And it was sort of equidistant between us and a mother and her two children and a church volunteer that was helping us for them to safety. It was very chaotic. And obviously we were all sort of in shock because the round had landed very close to us. Everything was very dusty. And our security adviser immediately went to the aid of the injured and to a soldier who is nearby. And by the time he called us over, the protocol as we wait to be told, it's clear you can come. And so by the time he called us over, I ran across the street not knowing what to expect. Obviously I knew there was someone injured, but I anticipated it being a soldier. And although there were civilians crossing steadily and even during the strike, I mean, because nothing was shielded. So people had to continue to move. And so when I got there, I came upon these four lifeless bodies. Of course I didn't know if they were dead or alive at that point. I noticed sort of the tiny little moon boots of a child. And as a mother, that was sort of incredibly jarring and devastating moment. And I was trying to survey, but I was also kind of in shock. And I, one side of my brain was sort of saying, you have to start photographing. And you have to take these pictures because I knew that I had just witnessed something that was an intentional targeting of civilians. And so I took a few photographs, but rounds were still coming in. So we were, our security adviser Steve was saying, you know, hurry up, work very quickly, and we have to leave. And so I kind of moved around the scene and taking a few photographs, thinking in my head also, I have to be respectful. And you know, perhaps I shouldn't show the faces. So I was trying to take pictures that show the faces and that didn't show the faces. So that we had some options. But the image you, I'm talking about, certainly the version I've seen, you don't necessarily look at the faces actually the way, now you've said that, the way that you look at the image. You can't see them, but you can see them. But it's more you look at the scenes of a family. Exactly. And so I've been doing this for, I've been covering war for over 20 years. And I know that there are so many images I've taken that have never been published because they're, they're graphic. And so I was thinking of that as I was shooting as horribles, that sounds because obviously I've just witnessed the most devastating scene, but I'm also a photojournalist and that's my job. And so I was, I was trying different angles. And frankly, I didn't think the picture could ever be published because it was civilians. Do you know, do you know the impacts of that photo? Yeah, I mean, it's been used by the, by I think the United States ambassador to the United Nations to talk about the intentional targeting of civilians. It's been used repeatedly as proof that civilians were targeted because I was there. I witnessed the run up and I, and I know that whoever was firing those rounds was bracketing onto that position.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3264,2022-10-15 18:09:05

When you think of cutting edge technology at sea, you might be thinking of stuff like this. But there's an incoming revolution on the high seas that isn't quite as sexy but could be significantly more impactful. From sign language shipping is the key component of global trade, about 80% of all the world's goods transported to sea at some point. But there's a significant unseen cost to the modern era of global commerce. About 3% of all the world's CO2 emissions come from shipping. 3% may not sound like a lot, but that's roughly comparable to the entire CO2 output of Germany. Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well-stocked maritime behemoths? You mentioned being a mother. Has that changed? The job... Yeah, I mean, it's definitely changed the job in the sense that I'm more cautious now than I was before I had children. I think to a sort of normal person who doesn't do this for a living, they probably can't see that. But for me making decisions on a minute-to-minute basis in a war zone, I know I'm being more cautious. I know I'm not going sort of all the way to the front or as far forward as some of my colleagues might be going. You also are now seeing, perhaps, when you see an image, when you create an image, when you see the reality of a child who is dead in front of you, would have always affected you. I imagine. Always. Has it changed, though? Yes, it has changed. I think I photographed... I have photographed children dying in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Somalia, during the Horn of Africa drought in 2011. It was always devastating, but I think now as a mother, the first thing I do is sort of put myself in the shoes of that mother. I know I live in constant fear that something will happen to my children. You're trying to keep yourself safe, but you're also trying to document at the same time. Of course. Perhaps processing it in a slightly different way. I mean, would you say you have become desensitized, though? No. Do you have to be in any way? No, not at all. I mean, I think I have ways of dealing with my emotion in that moment. But, you know, part of that is just really focusing on the task at hand, which is making photographs and looking through the viewfinder that definitely helps me focus on taking pictures. But I'm not desensitized at all. I mean, I cry pretty much all the time when I'm photographing. I get very, very emotional and that's okay. I mean, I, you know, I don't have an issue with that. I don't know what my colleagues think of me, but, you know, I think it's normal. I mean, I'm a human being. And do you think I mean, you thought it was about hanging back because the risk as well, not necessarily going straight to the front. And yet, when I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive when you...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3265,2022-10-15 18:13:09
14980," I asked you about that particular image, it sounded like it's very instinctive when you know you're not where you need to be and you are heading towards danger. Correct. And that's obviously what I struggle with because if I'm close and something happens a little closer or a little further from me but closer to the front line, I'll likely go. But I think where I'm positioning myself is sort of a little removed back and then making judgment calls every day. If I hear that a school has been hit and 30 children have been killed, I will go. If I hear that a building has been hit on the front line but no civilians were killed, I'm likely not to go. So I'm weighing sort of what will I gain from risking my life? Although that building has been hit but no civilians have been killed. I mean this talks to the idea of not you per se but a criticism of those in your field of being war junkies, trying to find the very worst to document and being in places they don't need to be, sometimes causing perhaps more risk. What do you say to that? For me the highest toll of war is civilian casualties. So that's not being a war junkie that is documenting reality and the reality is we are in a situation where one country has invaded another and every civilian who dies is on account of that invasion. So I think that if I'm in a position and civilians are being killed, I have to document that. That is a very important part of the job of someone who covers conflict. I'm presumably that for you in this work that you do, you don't just cover war, you cover two humanitarian disasters, climate change, the effects on the planet on that. But when it is about civilians, it sounds like the justification you have to make to yourself to your family and to those who could be critical is that you are providing evidence. Yeah and that evidence has been used already by the United Nations. Have you taken pictures of people killing others, of the actual killers before? I mean I've taken pictures of people who have been accused of killing others but I have not been there sort of in the moment. I just wonder what that's like as well. Seeing people do the very worst they can do to each other. I think people are very smart about journalists. They obviously don't allow us access to things when they are killing civilians. I think that there was a time in the Korngall Valley. I was with the American troops, the 173rd Airborne. I had spent two months living on the side of a mountain with the 173rd me and a colleague Elizabeth Rubin for the New York Times magazine. The point was to understand the nuances of war and why so many civilians were dying in Afghanistan. In fact, Lieutenant Colonel Oslohn, who was the commander of the Korngall Valley, was very smart because he had this philosophy of transparency because he believed that journalists needed to understand the nuances of war to understand why civilians were being killed. We were in Rock Operation Rock Avalanche, which was in the movie The Documentary Restrepo. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's extraordinary. We were in that operation where we jumped out of helicopters in the middle of the night into the heart of Taliban territory, literally walked with everything we owned for six days, and eventually we were ambushed by the Taliban. We were ambushed from three sides and there was a huge gun battle. Three soldiers were shot, one was killed, and in the retaliation of the American troops, I was standing with some of the soldiers, everyone was very shaken up, of course. And one of the soldiers said, look, they're using Afghan women and children as human shields. And he literally had me look through the scope of his gun, and there were women and children on the roofs of the building where they were shooting from. And that is a case where it was incredible to witness, and I could only have witnessed that if I, because I had spent so much time with these troops, and really was willing to risk my life and to be there in the middle of Operation Rock Avalanche. A shot you took during that maneuver, we're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush where it's a very...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3266,2022-10-15 18:17:53
14981," Shot you took during that maneuver. We're going to take a look at that. Can you take me through it? There is an image, the aftermath of that ambush, where it's a very dusty picture. It is a scout team carrying the body of Sergeant Rugal. And he's in a body bag. And it was after that. And the scout team, Clainard, who is sort of leading the way, is crying. And they're walking through this very sort of desolate landscape. And I remember shooting that photograph and asking myself, what are we doing here? What are we doing here? Years after 9, 11, fighting in the middle of the mountains where there are no people. And it just felt like such a waste that this young man had died for nothing. And in fact, a few years later, the American troops pulled out entirely from that area. There's another image of yours I wanted to bring to mind and for us to have a look at and talk about an 18-year-old woman in labor stranded in 2009. Tell me about that and how that came about. So in 2009, I won a MacArthur Fellowship. That is in America, it's called the Genius Grant. And it's essentially given to all different disciplines from a cellist to a scientist to a photographer, where I was paid a salary for five years with no strings attached to just focus on my work. And I felt a lot of pressure to decide what to focus on with my work, because it was the first time I could decide, not be assigned a story. And so I started doing research, and I decided to focus on maternal mortality, and why over 500,000 women a year were dying in childbirth at that point. This was 2009, as you said. And Afghanistan, where I had been working for a decade at that point, had one of the highest rates of maternal death in the world. And that was because there was such a bad road network, people, women who were pregnant or in labor didn't have access necessarily to medical professionals, or to clinics or hospitals that were staffed with doctors. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They just couldn't get where they needed to. They had to take a donkey for 12 hours, and imagine being in labor, getting on the back of a donkey. And so I went to very remote villages in Badaksham province, which was one of these provinces with high numbers. And on the way back, I was riding with Dr. Ziba, who was also helping me translate. And we noticed these two women on the side of a mountain, and there was not a man with them, which in Afghanistan is very rare. And we stopped the car and said, what are you doing here? Do you need help? And it turned out the woman on the right, Norene Soe was in labor. And Norene says, husband's first wife had died in childbirth. And he was so, but when we met them, their car had broken down. So they were stranded on the side of the road. So I said, well, just get in my car. I'll take you to the hospital. We're going toward Fiasabad, which was the capital of the state. And they said, no, we need permission from the husband. So we'll wait. And so I turned to Dr. Ziba and I said, OK, you have to find the husband. There's one road in the whole province. He's obviously on the road. So she found him, of course, pretty quickly, and brought him back in the whole family piled in my car and we took them to the hospital. And everyone asked me if she delivered safely. And if I took photographs, and yes, she delivered safely. But no, I did not take photographs because I felt like I changed the course of that story with my presence by taking them. So he took a photo. I took about three frames and that photograph is one of those frames. And that's when you had met. And just seen it because it's so striking, the blue. Exactly. I met them. We asked their story and then we asked permission right before Ziba left to find the husband. We asked permission for me to take a few photographs. A lot's happening on Wall Street.

This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg television and radio. It is crucial important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost to an illness that needs a cure for something as universally important to human life as sleep. Mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happened there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts, but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out where you're sleeping. I think on balance being a woman has been a help to you in the future, being a woman rather than a insurance. Yes, everyone thinks it's a hindrance, but in fact, it's a huge help because people, first of all, I've access to men and women and particularly when I'm working in countries like Afghanistan and Somalia where men and women are usually segregated by gender and people underestimate women I find and they still do and so they sort of discount me and say, OK, sure, sure, go do you need me to be underestimating that? Yeah, I love being an officer. I love it. Yeah, it's one of those things, but I suppose on the other serious, much more serious side of it is that again, when you're thinking and calculating risks, you know, rape as a weapon of war is a unique tool wielded against women. Yes. And for me, when I was, I've been kidnapped twice. The first time was in Iraq and that was only a day and it turned out compared to Libya and it was quite sort of, it was manageable in the sense that we were working outside of Fulujah. I was working with a colleague from the New York Times. We had heard a helicopter of American troops went down. We went to find it. We got caught by insurgents who thought maybe we were with the American occupation. We finally convinced them we were journalists. They held us until dusk and then eventually let us go. Obviously it was terrifying. We were in the middle of the 11 hours. We didn't know if we would survive. Libya was much more violent, much more dramatic. We were four journalists in one car. Originally we had been two in each car, but one of the cars, one of the drivers brothers had been shot at the front line. So he quit in the middle of the battle and we ended up in one car. We had to decide how long to stay. That is not an easy discussion because with four journalists, everyone has a different perspective on how long to stay, what our needs are, how dangerous the situation is. By the time we decided to pull back east toward Benghazi, we ran into one of Gaddafi's troops checkpoints. It was incredibly hostile. The rebels we had been covering started opening fire on that checkpoint. So we were literally in a wall of bullets. The men were pulled out of the car. Me as the only woman, I was sort of left sitting there because they didn't know what to do with me. But the car was not armored. So I had to get out of the car because I knew that I needed to get behind cover. I crawled across the back seat and when I jumped out, one of Gaddafi's troops sort of came to me and was pulling at my cameras. Instinctively I was pulling back, even though the world bullets literally going, you know, next all around us. We finally made it to cover behind this sort of checkpoint building. And we're all told to lie face down in the dirt. We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3268,2022-10-15 18:26:46
14983," We each had a Kalashnikov put to our heads and we were about to be executed. We were begging for our lives. The commander came over at that point and said you can't execute them. They're American, which this was all in Arabic and Anthony Shadee later translated for us. You know in retrospect, I have no idea why they spared us being American because in the Middle East a lot of people don't like our foreign policy. And so we were tied up and blindfolded. And essentially for the next three days we were beaten up, tied up, blindfolded, threatened with execution. And for me as the only woman I was touched repeatedly. I was not raped, but of course in that time being tied up and blindfolded, I thought of the many, many women I have interviewed over the years who have been raped. And so I sort of ironically looked to them for strength because I thought well if they survived it and if it happens to me, I can survive it as well. Are you living just minutes a minute? A minute a minute. I mean in a kidnapping there is no sort of an outward on the line. It is literally every second is survival mode. It is what can I do to get through this fear? What can I do to get through this pain? I mean it sounds like the scene from a film and yet it's your life. And I believe Jennifer Lawrence has been interested in your life all there was. She was. She was. We spent about three years together when Warner Brothers optioned the rights to my memoir. I wrote a memoir after that. Called it's what I do a photographer's life of love and more. And that memoir was optioned almost immediately by Warner Brothers. Steven Spielberg was slated to direct and Jennifer Lawrence was slated to play me. And that went on for three years. What's it like? Taking Jennifer Lawrence to all sides. I took her to the border with South Sudan when it was very, very tense. She wanted to understand what it feels like to feel that fear and to be, you know, to be close to a war zone. Obviously we had to worry about her safety. So I couldn't take her. Hey, you're not sure. Hey, but a word about what I list while you're dealing with it. It's very stressful. Let's just say when I put her on the plane to, you know, from Uganda, I couldn't walk for a week. My back went out. But yeah, but she eventually dropped out. And so now it is being made into a limited series. So a TV series. A TV series. Correct. Okay. But you at least Jennifer Lawrence now knows what it's like to do your job. She does. She's just come out with a movie playing a character named Lindsay. She's got inspiration from what if you learned that from being in these scenarios coming in and coming out of some of the worst things we can do to each other? Yeah. I mean, I guess I've learned the capacity for survival, for resilience, for forgiveness. The fact that human beings can be equally evil as they can be amazingly generous and, and yeah, resilient. I think that I've learned a lot from the people I've covered, but I think we have to look at the ability of human beings to live both within those situations and to survive them after. Well, thank you very much for taking us behind the lens with you. Thank you. Lindsay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye.

But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd lose, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was, than try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right? What's the end? How do you measure success? I'd rather measure success. I'm definitely not financial. I mean, I think it's more about, for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's seen the magazine, and it's the norm for them all. A curvy woman on a traitor palace, who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth it. That for me is success. You know, anybody who knows or has known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know. But I can relate, because, like, as I said to you, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know? So for me, shining in light on people and making them see, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act. Seem, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalized. You know, it's been normalized. And for me, I'm quite happy when I see that. You know, when you put Dame Judy Dench on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put, you know, a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem. That for me shows that, you know, we're advancing. We're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important. And so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, some, you know, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job and sort of a connection. And being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have good as your team, you know. No man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect and who's views you respect, you know, and who respects you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be also terrible? I mean, I'm a worker. I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me, you know. Ultimately, the final decision rests with me. But I do listen. I like conversation. I like interaction. And so that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss. And that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. And they can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they have made me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been mad.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3271,2022-10-15 18:39:54
14986," The fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? I mean, I was five years ago. Let's go back to ID when I was 18. I heard it at a magazine, which would come out. I was all about club kids and you had to be out there. And the only way you could see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand. You know, the magazine is sort of the highest, or the high, the best paper, the best photographers, the best cultural messages. But at the moment, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover, essentially. So we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me. I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they going to go down? No, I mean, yeah, but they're going to work in hand with digital platforms. But also, I'll tell you something. New readers of old, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, did they sell platforms, or audio videos we put out. So yes, now it's increased 10 folds. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger, because of the whole digital landscape. And I hope that as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers, and we also keep our loyal readers. Do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist sort of alongside digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So, no, I don't think print is going to die. So fewer copies. See a more collected quality. More quality. You know, almost like a book. A table book. I love that. I need to. We make it very transparent to the shopper, before they accept an order. What's the order is going to look like? How much work on a piece of them, and how much, like, the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places. Our demographic of shoppers is completely different from food delivery and our right sharing, where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different and just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.

Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? Well, not so much fun. I literally have to be held back. The brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the poles. I'm not one of the people that leaves work and shuts themselves. I really want to be out there seeing the world as today. All is beauty. I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer? No, it's just curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50 or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But the world is such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. We still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost 6 million every month to Britishville. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European Vogue as well, Spain, Italy, Germany and France, and mentoring a whole new generation of editors. When there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate, but it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. I learn from these content leads, and I hope that they also learn. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle, or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation or what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago, I put Taylor Swift on the cover, and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is the conversation of the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's going to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money, so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show, or having, you know, a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs I know we need to employ more people from, you know, from, you know, diverse backgrounds, because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people, you know, a variety of voices, always better than just one. And I always also say, you know, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen, but I think since, you know, George Floyd was murdered, more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And, you know, it's a slow, it's a slow process, some have taken it seriously, and some are still working their way through it. But, you know, we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? I know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3273,2022-10-15 18:48:13
14988," So working their way through it, but we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. Right? You know, so you have to really sort of focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of, also of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. Yes, if they promise something, you know, that I asked for, then I will literally wear you down. I'll literally chase you until you keep your promise, that's just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. You know, going back to what we discussed before. That's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table, or just also seeing an idea of a cabinet. I hope they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves. As well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, you know, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Rather than standing on our soapboxes going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, groundwork trying to change from with it? Yes, from with it. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than, you know, I say, do this. This is how you do it because we don't live there. You have a memoir out. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. Or something about when it's your fifth year at Vogue. You know, I got married this year. You know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time. But it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people see people like you and I. And they think, you know, we just got here. We were always here. And for me, it was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. So I just wanted to share that story with them. Sort of young people. I swear, as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry, really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I'll always feel like an outsider. But as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England. You know, different languages, different foods. And I now go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider. I was also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at Britishville, I was the black gay working class outsider. But, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. So I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's about the duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana. But also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the person made me who I am is really my mother. I mean, I mean, I love my mother.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3274,2022-10-15 18:52:40
14989," You left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean, really is my mother. I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, about fascist. She also taught me that beauty came in all forms, that women were beautiful, no matter what shaped they were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess that my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father, so the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from here to the best of both worlds. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father, how did your father shape the person you are today? It's so funny, I should ask this question, because I never thought I was like my father growing up. I was very shy, very sensitive. You know, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To me and my dad were sort of, you know, or sort of, sort of, they're in disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at a certain time. You know, he grew up as an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. And, but I've found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T.

What was that like? Yes. Basically I have sort of very high in my opias. I've never had great eyesight. And I went through a series of retinal detachments for to be exact. And with each detachment, I'll sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks. And in the dark room, and it was very harrowing. It's very harrowing time in my life. But I always say, you know, you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms, my imagination was even bigger. I dream bigger. And I came out to sort of the last surgery. And the cover I did was for W Magazine with Rihanna, the queen, with a golden eye. And I look back at it, and I thought, oh my god, there are the eyes, some limit, some limitily. So yes, it was very challenging. And even to this day, I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay. They're great right now. And the more I look after myself, the better. The better.

14990," And, you know, the more I look after myself, the better. The better I'll get. But it's amazing. You power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean, there have been times when I felt this is too much, but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start. You know, I am my mother's son, my father's son. You know, the edge to move forward is always there. And that's why, you know, when I was young, I would always get up and work. I had a reclutty touch, but I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood book folio. But now I'm learning to say no. Now I'm learning I can't do that job. I can't fly. No, it takes time, but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no, right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers, and there's so many beautiful ones, is there one that's special to you? Well, I say to someone, they're like my children. You always have a favorite child. But I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown. You know, when the world had essentially shut down, you know, the teams were sort of scattered all around London. And I had to go back to the days of I did when, you know, you had to really create user imagination. And we had a series of four covers, Judy Dinch, when they said, you know, anybody of a six-tissue state at home that essential workers cover, a cover of landscapes, just so people could take a breather. And the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered. And I really think we create covers that, you know, in years time people can look back and see what the time, that period was like for me, an artist always has to reflect their times to paraphrase Nina Simone and that's really important for me. I mean, there was a bit of controversy with Linda Vanjolista. Yes. Yes, I mean, you know, there was a, there was a company that, oh, you know, she should, she should have looked a certain way, you know. And for me, I've known Linda in the 90s. I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be. And I also saw my friend go through really dark days, you know, due to the complications for surgery. Literally disappear from the world, really not the Linda the world news. So when we were doing this cover, it was the collaboration. She wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. I mean, some that you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? I'm a bit of a show, but I'm definitely a creative. But, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know. I wasn't like I kept saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, have my dad not left? I don't know, even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist and I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. Oh. So, as you look back on your career, what would you say is the best investment advice you've ever received? Probably the best investment advice that I never received. But that I've lived my whole life around, is surround yourself with really good people. I thought about it just today, like I do many times, you know, what makes a great investor? A great investment firm is comprised of people who are optimists and pessimists and realists.

14991," personalities is where you find truth. It's part of the reason I'm so focused on freedom of expression. I see it my own four walls, the robust and fulsome debates around how we commit our capital, what defines a good idea, what businesses to build or pursue. That's what drives the success at Citadel. And I've been very fortunate in life to have always had a group of friends who really push me, who make me better. And here I get to work with three and a half thousand colleagues who in their ways make me better each and every day and collectively as a team, we've had the opportunity to have an incredible impact on the financial landscape around the world. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So Apatosaurus is an example. Now, I said really long skinny tails. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these Saurapod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. That's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to the world's economy. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver parts of somewhere, that's an easy job. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in market power, revenue, profitability, investor interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, we're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number-cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's kind of like being counting in the back office to be successful in finance. I mean, you have to have the financial expertise, right? But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. We need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important and she has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team if she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically if they have a problem, they share it for us with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, okay, on the basis, what are the options? What can...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3277,2022-10-15 19:05:36
14992," Do. My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges, and what should we do going forward? Deutsche Post DHL Group consists of five divisions. Express Germany's Post and Parcel Service. Global Forwarding and Freight, Supply Chain, and E-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years, while the surge of E-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen E-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized E-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape, but no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic, not only domestic e-commerce has taken from a faster growth trajectories and anticipated, but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network, but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage, so we believe that there will be a huge course opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now. I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, Cashflow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash and bank account is the responsibility of the whole organisation. She says, we can't be successful as a company. If we are not collecting the cash for our services, we have provided. She has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities, in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also with our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then, if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share-by-back program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand. But deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say, no, when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person in that grade, if you have a CEO who is risk-abuse, because you need somebody. You know, the business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3278,2022-10-15 19:10:07
14993," And jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has also already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need to reject it a stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be. We will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact. The logistics industry. And there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening. And I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think that the issue there is the increase in interest rates. Has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, and with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is the more of a view that we're actually heading into. Certainly, any comments low down may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world. The world will not go entirely in recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that DP DHL is, to some extent, recession proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recession scenarios due to the breadth of support for you. The balance of support for you really gives us a lot of resilience against any type of headwind. Coming up, look at DP DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state of the art in logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. No one covers the world like Bloomberg. The Prashtikokra just got far too hot in burning in for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach and resources, from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day. Bloomberg, your global business authority. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, Melanie Christ has made her mark in global business. That's not what she originally attempted to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3279,2022-10-15 19:14:17
14994," That's not what she originally attempted to do. I really wanted to go into research. I wanted to become a physicist and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. And I had no idea what it was about. But what they told me was quite interesting. And so I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. And I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey. Then spent four years in private equity with APAC's partners in London. Before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at the time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the county. We were acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing. And I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group. Becoming the CFO of our DHL Express division. So from then on it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Maloney Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all. But you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organisation that we should move into a certain direction. It's useless. DP DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. Which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. So globalisation connecting the world. Ecomers, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller ecomers shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building. There's solar panels on the roof and everything. And digitalisation and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in ecomers volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course there are all the best debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. Unfortunately they convinced us because then with Covid and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as Covid accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures. But automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business that is going to be less need for labour for workers. Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely of what is in the here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by light and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they are doing here every day. We have been working on the service for the last 20 years. We might get one third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation. At the beginning of years ago when we started that journey people said, oh you know I might lose my job. I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3280,2022-10-15 19:18:37
14995," In the last two years, as a question in the town hall. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet, which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. The biggest chunk of our aircraft, but also have short and medium and long-term visas, and visit growth in our business, we anticipate that the people keep going. You've talked about investing, of course, in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is, of course, very, very carbon intensive, at least a lot of emissions? Yes. So you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions, two-thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel. And we said that we're really willing to spend billions on it. And we now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put seven billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030, with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators and the logistics sector need to consider, but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion. Should we make a financial commitment? How much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate, is it right, to say we want to invest seven billion until 2030? There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in I-HART, where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number, this is a right approach, we convinced our colleague, and that's the reason why we are, where we are, where we are seen as somebody who really commit, they're not that many companies who have quantified their future investment. Still ahead, how one of the business world's most influential women is working to strengthen gender equality within her company. I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. Why do the biggest names in business choose Bloomberg? I have a great question. It's a great question. Great question. I guess a question I get all night. Bloomberg, top experts, great questions. Big, expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you've probably noticed that these big, expensive cities keep getting more, well, expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We've had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. You had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Or are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Market's are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet.

14996," Markets are preparing to close but the day is not over yet. Talked it is now up about 45%. A lot of volatility right now. You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than expected. I'll create a today to overweight. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The meaning of bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't playing it on today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Deutsche Post DHL Group CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high according to a study by Chris Calder Associates. An executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I asked Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even-not-thinking about these challenges so much. So when I started physics, there weren't many women. So I was somehow always used to it. And it can also be an advantage when you're kind of like the only girl in the room. I mean, the boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who all kind of like were doxies and white shirts and look alike. So I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally, it was more balancing my own expectations around kind of like getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself, thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. So how do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if you have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the short list because we have enough female talent. So every short list should contain a woman and then the best person in the race should win. CEO, Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions. That you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person and that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And I hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What juice is the biggest opportunities for DP DHL over the next 10 years? I think we have a fantastic portfolio and we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very at-all way. Sometimes when you kind of like think about all the risk controlling and stuff, a people who.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3282,2022-10-15 19:27:37
14997," Think about all the risk controlling and stuff. People tend to create the impression that you can pre-plan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very agile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group overall, digitalization and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, but then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonization measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalization area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The word is complex. You can't know it all. So you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers will you be a really great CFO. I'm Tom McKenzie. This is Bloomberg. And you're one of the most fascinating entrepreneurs, because you all started with Young. What did you learn? Did you always think that you'd be an entrepreneur? Probably, yes. I think, which is a bit sad. From age what? Five? I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, so even I probably can spell the word and still can't take it. It's sort of in my blood, but it's... I'm actually really fun starting a business. It's fun growing a business. I feel it's a real privilege. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I come from a family of entrepreneurs, but I feel it's a real privilege. And I started my business officially at 18, but I think I knew I wanted to do it very differently from about 15. But I'm sure it's, you know, if you're surrounded by it, it feels very natural. So, yes, it's fun. And it started how? By making you want to Florence. It was an Italy and you started handbags. Yeah, exactly. So I knew I was actually given a handbag by my mother when I was about 61 of her old handbags. And I remember how it made me feel. And I think fashion is fascinating for the mood-changing, the confidence-boosting aspects. It was a tribal aspect of what fashion does. And so I went at 18 to Florence knowing that was the home of Leathercose, which is what interested me. I just wanted to learn, actually, and be surrounded by craftsmen who are making things as important. And that's going to be very interesting, I think, over the next sort of 10 years. I think the on-shoring of craft and manufacturing is going to be fascinating, actually. And I watched the off-shoring. I literally saw it. And I think we're going to be seeing that coming back to local. We have to. We have to have objectives in terms of carbon, you know. Proximity is going to be key. I think it is crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s. And so it makes it a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harnessed to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize, and that makes you smart. You can keep going.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3283,2022-10-15 19:32:23
14998," to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom, you've got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring to use out while you're sleeping.

Every Friday with 30 minutes dedicated to fixed income, I'm Jonathan Farrow this. Here's my Bergroll Yield. Indonesia's economy is rising fast with massive factories like these ones dominating the outskirts of Jakarta. I last met President Jokko Widodo or Jokkoey as he's more often known in his home turn of solo. But that was almost three years ago and a lot has changed. So with Elon Musk, yeah. We left Jakarta's presidential palace by convoy for a huge Hyundai factory built during COVID on three quarters of a million square meters of land. Jakkoey, who wants ran a furniture business, has equally large ambitions for his country's economy. He's banned the export of raw nickel in favor of downstream products will instead produce refined nickel that will be used in the batteries to power electric vehicles. An equally impressive factory is being built nearby for just that purpose. If you work in a factory, it's a salary much higher. Comparing with the other industry, in the automatic industry, higher. Much higher. Higher than furniture. I've got years. If Jakkoey has his way, other raw materials will follow. Cold, box-ite, tin, gold and copper, even palm oil. This November, Indonesia will host the G20. Jakkoey is one of the few leaders to have met both China's Eugene Ping and Russia's Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine. This is a conversation with President Jakkoey of Indonesia. President Jakkoey, thank you for talking to Bloomberg again. When I was last year in 2019, you had just been reelected. Now, you're halfway through your final term as President of Indonesia. You are the biggest country in Southeast Asia. You are right in the middle of the United States and China and their arguments. You recently said the world was in dire need of responsibility and wisdom. My first question for you was Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan? Was it wise? Was it even responsible? Yes, it was a good thing to have a big party. The rivalry of the big countries is indeed worrying. What we want is for this region to be stable, peaceful, so that we can build economic growth. And I think not only in Indonesia, Asian countries also want the same thing. We can build a big economy. I think you are being very diplomatic, President. There was word that Nancy Pelosi was going to come to Indonesia. And then you decided to change that plan. Is that true? No, no. We will openly receive, but there was no visit. There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3284,2022-10-15 19:35:50
14999," There now seems to be a more serious danger of a Chinese invasion in Taiwan. And there is a concern that if there is a conflict in Taiwan, it would spill over into the South China Sea, where you have territory, territory that China can test. Is Indonesia ready to defend itself or defend its land and waters in that case? So you're ready for that conflict militarily if it happens. Yes, once again we want to remind you that this is the case. We do want the region to be peaceful. It shouldn't come to the point that tensions rise until it affects economic growth, and then later on affects the well-being of our people. In my opinion, it is very important that there is a space for dialogue between leaders, especially leaders of big countries. The global situation is extremely difficult, and there shouldn't be further unnecessary issues. We are going through a food crisis and an energy crisis that hasn't been resolved, the pandemic still exists in some countries. Is that going to be a big theme for you at the G20 that you want to turn the debate away from these rivalries between superpowers and focus on issues like food security, inflation? Yes, it is better than having open conflict. It is better to have a forum for dialogue like G20. If there is space for discussion, we can discuss and have debates and hopefully come up with solutions. This is what we want. This is why we have a space for dialogue. I know that you have invited President Xi Jinping to come to the G20. Has he said he will come here in November? Yes, President Xi Jinping will come. President Putin has also told me he will come. Do you worry at all about the G20 being this conflict where you have the democracies coming forward with plans? You have Putin sitting there in one room like this and you have Xi Jinping with his own agenda. It will be a very difficult house party to run. At the G20, we do not want to add to conflict or problems but to resolve the problems. How we can resolve all these problems, not to add problems and conflict. You know, you've been to Xi Putin, you've been to Cesar Lensky, you've been to Xi Jinping. Do you think that by bringing people together that that is a way to solve conflict? Sometimes it can increase it. There must be communication, even if it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem. It is better to have dialogue than to have open conflict. When we started this interview, I said that you were in the middle between China and America. But having looked at Indonesia, I looked at the numbers. America's investment in Indonesia over the past five years is $9 billion. China has invested $40 billion. You know, you look around here. We have a Chinese car factory around the corner. China is buying up a lot of the refineries and make precious metals. America at the moment is losing the battle for hearts and minds in Indonesia, but also in Southeast Asia. Do you think that is fair? This is an approach that needs to be renewed because what is needed by countries in Asia, including Indonesia, is investment. What investment? If it comes from China, we welcome it. If it comes from America, we welcome it. We are not going to be choosy. We are not going to be choosy. We are not going to be choosy. You are not choosy, but one side is coming and saying, I want to invest, I want to trade. And the other one is saying, no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, let's talk about that. That is how I am making it.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3285,2022-10-15 19:40:17
15000," And the other one is saying no trade packs. And I want to come and talk about other things. You know, this will be the Batizet-Sambikai. That is why I said previously they need to renew their approach. You've dealt with Donald Trump, who famously insulted his allies and promoted America first. Joe Biden was supposed to be different, but rhetoric aside, is there any change? Surely Joe Biden is still saying America first. He just isn't insulting you at the same time. Yeah, Galo Gitamoli, yeah. Indonesia wants to be friends with everyone. With any country, we don't have problems with any country. Each country will have their own approach. Each leader has their own style and approach, so there shouldn't be a problem. But now what's needed by Indonesia is investment, technology that will change our society. It's a very important thing. I just wanted to ask you about ASEAN since you mentioned it. You have a group of countries, but it is one where you look at the countries. It includes Myanmar, which seems to have all these problems with human rights and so on. Why do you keep Myanmar in ASEAN? We already had a meeting in Jakarta with all members of ASEAN. All the leaders came, including Myanmar's junta, and there's a consensus, five point consensus. The implementation hasn't taken place, and the approach we have taken hasn't worked. That's the complication we're facing. There are several ASEAN meetings after that, which we did not include in Myanmar participation. One very last thing on foreign policy, you've been to go and see Vladimir Putin, and tried to talk to him and you saw President Zelensky in Ukraine. I think you've focused on food security and issues like that. Do you see any sign of peace or progress there as the President of the G20? Yes. Sayak gave, then put it out, and then put it out. I went to Kiev and talked to President Zelensky, one and a half hours, then went to Moscow, Russia, to meet with President Putin, and talked with him almost two and a half hours. I want to see a space for dialogue after the meeting so we can discuss. Anywhere is no problem, but I see the chances are small. There are certain issues like food crisis, and President Zelensky said they can't export because there were no guarantees for security to ship goods from Odessa port to Istanbul. That was the message I conveyed to President Putin. And President Putin said he will guarantee security for ships to enter Odessa. Those are what I told the media. And President Zelensky said he will guarantee security to the government to enter Odessa. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security to the government to enter Odessa. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security to the government to enter Odessa. President Zelensky said he will guarantee security to the government to enter Odessa.

We will never. All of who will remain? We will never. No. Indonesia is an extremely resource rich country and the economy's potential is enormous. It has a third of the world's nickel reserves used in the lithium batteries of electric vehicles. It's the world's biggest grower of palm oil, the second largest miner of tin, the third biggest producer of coal, and ranks fifth for boxite. Its grassberg mine has won the largest reserves of gold and copper. Resource nationalism is nothing new, but Indonesia's two term president is doubling down. After banning the export of raw nickel, he's now planning the same path for all the others. Jikoï is moving downstream, creating higher value products that will be used in everything from aircraft to semiconductors to touch screens and the batteries in electric vehicles. We want the added value to be in Indonesia, so there will be state income in form of tax, provide jobs in Indonesia. And the most important thing is that we can enjoy the added value. I'll give you nickel as an example. When we exported raw materials four to five, six years ago, the value was only $1.1 billion. Once we went downstream in 2021, our exports were valued at $20.8 billion, that's nearly 18 times. That's what we want to do with boxite, copper, tin, crude, palm oil, and others. We are not being closed. We are being open indeed. US, China, Europe, want to come and cooperate. We are open. The messages you want people to come here and use these raw materials to make things. And so just to be clear, ferronical and pig iron, they will be the next ones to be stopped exported. So they people have to use them here. If this is the case, it will be the next one. When we, the industry here, are ready, exports automatically will stop. What we want is to build a large ecosystem to produce electric cars, as many as we can here in Indonesia. And boxite and tin will also be in this list of materials to use inside Indonesia. Yes, that is correct. Not only nickel, boxite, for example, is used to produce alumina. And then be used to make cars body or cars chassis. Okay, this is more beautiful. You've talked about putting attacks on nickel products. You know, the next stage up, is that going to happen this year? An export tax on nickel products. Yes, come on, Ginnon. You're just possible to impose it this year? I can see around here you've had a lot of success. You and I went around to a rather nice car factory. And you have the electric vehicle, the electric battery construction, Hyundai, LG, Volkswagen and Toyota, Seemkin. The person who everyone talks about is Tesla. And you have a five billion dollar contract to supply nickel ore. But you wanted to have a Tesla car factory. It now looks as if you hoped together a Tesla battery facility.

If it is Tesla, we want them to build electric cars in Indonesia. From Ford as well, we want them to build electric cars here. From Hyundai, electric cars, from car makers in Japan, Toyota and Suzuki. We want a huge ecosystem of electric cars for the world. We don't just want to reach batteries only because this is just half of it. You've made a very eloquent case and Elon Musk is a famously reasonable man. Why is he said no to the car factory then? It's still in discussion. Let's see later the final result. You have negotiated with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Either of them is difficult to deal with as Elon Musk. Everything needs time. I don't want to go quick with no result. It needs an intense communication and the result will show. Do you think there has been an element, though? Again, looking around here, there's just been, tends to be the Asian countries which have been first trying to build electric battery facilities here. In the future, we want to build a large ecosystem for electric cars that is truly environmentally friendly. So the energy will come from green energies such as hydro power plants, geothermal, wind, sea waves, solar panels. The famous case of the palm oil, I think people back in April, you suddenly imposed an export ban on palm oil. The price shot up to $1,600. The flooded domestic market then you changed your mind. Partly because the domestic market was so full of palm oil, you let it export, the prices come down. Some people would say that Indonesia is now a very honestly run country but it can be capricious. You change between these things. Do you think the palm oil ban was a mistake in retrospect? Yes. At that time, the domestic market situation, there was a price spike of almost double, so we made a policy. There were several policies but it didn't solve the problems for months on, so we stopped exporting crude palm oil and the domestic price fell. Then we resumed exports. I think it's okay, no problem. Will you remove the obligation to serve the domestic market first, the famous DMO, this idea that palm oil has to be offered to the domestic market first. Do you now want to get rid of that? Yes. If going forward, the price is stable, we can remove the DMO policy. We prioritize our national interest. We will continue to work on our national interest. I'm here at the Delhi Airport and behind me, you can see Spice Jet 737 Max aircraft. Spice Jet 737 is going to compensate Spice Jet in form of cash and aircraft. There's a big celebration happening at the Goli Airport as you can see, they've lived through",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3288,2022-10-15 19:53:03
15003," There's a big celebration happening at the Goliere airport. As you can see, they've literally rolled down the red carpet for Spice Jet Chairman, are dressing. There are balloons, there are flowers. This is a big deal for Spice Jet because it is the only Indian operator of Boeing 77 Max Green's Garden food. Watch Bloomberg surveillance early edition for the news you need when you need it. I'm not in a little of Kayleigh Limes in New York and N Edwards in London. Australia's Central Bank raises interest rates twice as much as Bulkars. Then surveillance for in-depth analysis. Well outside Tom Kane and Lisa Brownbottes, I'm Jonathan Ferro, the RBI fronts and sensors. How does Japan get away with not raising rates? Can it sustain? It's normal at a time when everybody else is facing a very different way out. Bloomberg surveillance, be informed, be prepared, be ahead of the game. A consistent thing you've been talking about is green industries in the environment. You have a a goal to make Indonesia carbon neutral by 2060. As you know, most of your energy now comes from coal, coal prices have gone up. And I wonder, will you stick to your pledge that you would build no new coal fired plants that is gone forever? Our target is very ambitious. 41 percent, 2030 and 2060, we should be at zero, but this requires technology and funding. Money, the potential is clear. We have potential of renewable energy to produce 434,000 megawatts. But to shift from coal to renewable is not an easy thing because the price to produce energy from coal is still cheaper than geothermal. Yes, it's being done. It's just that there are still some that are still on the process of being completed, not new ones. Indonesia has an oversupply of electricity. Half of the emissions from Indonesia come from land use and forest clearing. 51 percent of Indonesia is forest and you have committed to keep to that level. But you are still letting people cut down rainforest, which is the really most useful bit. They're building other forests, farm forests. Isn't that the wrong thing? You should be protecting the rainforest first and then thinking about the other kinds of forests next. John, forest fire happened more than 20 years ago. Since 2016, it has been reduced by 85 percent. We also do restoration on more than 2 million hectares of peatlands. Within the next three years, we will also do restoration for 660,000 hectares of mangroves forest. In the past five years, we also imposed a moratorium on new palm oil plantation. Does it make you cross when people from the rich world like me appear? And countries that have already taken down their forests used their coal and you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come in lecture you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3289,2022-10-15 19:57:14
15004," Use their coal and you have a country of 270 million much poorer people who have not done this yet. And we come and lecture you about this. Massive forest clearing is in the past. No more today. What we have now is restoration, revitalizing, taking care of the environment. I have required all mining companies to build a nursery for reclamation of their mining areas. We are working to improve the environment. I can take you to the nearest nursery center in Borgor that produce about 2 million seedlings a year. And we will have 30 of those nurseries. Then you will believe that we are serious. Can I ask you very quickly about New Centaura, this capital that you are building. $34 billion, the aim is to finish it by 2045. This will be the new capital of Jakarta in Borneo. I wonder, will you finish the first stage in August 2024? Are you on time in terms of that? The shift to a new capital is a long-term plan since the first president, Sukarno. It's my responsibility to put the policy in place, but we still check the feasibility studies. It will need funding of $33 billion, and we will use state budget to cover for 20%. While the rest, 80% from private sector, from investment. And this isn't just for two years. It's for 20 years. I'm confident with a good concept, and with good returns for the investments, I am sure many investors will come in. You know that many people in Indonesia look at problems, look at challenges like building New Centaura. That will happen long after you are supposed to give up. You are currently very popular. You have a 68% approval rating. And some people, some of your allies in the legislature have suggested you could amend the constitution so that you could do a third term, keep building this capital, keep building car factories. I wonder if you said before you will follow the constitution, but can you rule this out? Regardless of the constitution? Let's talk about the new capital, New Centaura first. There is law on this that is supported by 93% of the parliament. What's there to be afraid of with that much support? Secondly, an amendment of constitution, I have said repeatedly, I will abide by the constitution, although support from the parliament is at 84%. Once more, I will abide to the constitution and wishes of the people. I am not afraid of the constitution. Thank you very much for talking Bloomberg again. Thank you very much.

Start exploring to see what's moving the markets. Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. MUSIC So who's my guest this week? It's the courtroom artist Jane Rosenberg. Since 1946, broadcasts and photographs of criminal proceedings inside US federal courts has been strictly banned. No matter how notorious the accused or headline grabbing the crime, media cameras are kept out. Instead, it is left to the artist to be the eyes of the public and capture the drama of the courtroom. For the past 40 years, Rosenberg has come face to face with those involved in some of America's most high profile cases. She sketched everyone from El Chapo to Harvey Weinstein, and her drawings have been seen all over the world. MUSIC From the New York courts filled with mob bosses to those accused in the Me Too era, she has seen it all. So what is it like? Drawing, Gelaing Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby. Here's what's coming up. The now convicted sex trafficker, Gelaing Maxwell. And we're obviously making eye contact. When did you realize she was sketching you? She had, she was leaning on a piece of paper. She took out a piece of paper and she was going up and down, looking at me, looking at me. So, you know, I knew as she was sketching me, you could tell on somebody's sketching you. And is it right? I mean, I don't know if this is right, but Weinstein asked for more hair in one of your drawings? He did. He was walking. I was sitting here on an aisle, and he was seeing it, and he was walking out with his lawyers, and he looked over at my sketch. He said, can't you give me more hair? I just kept drawing, and I did not give him more hair. Jane, thank you so much for talking to me and to our viewers today. It's lovely to be with you. And I wonder how it does feel to be the subject instead of the one drawing and creating the work. I really hate it. And that's why I don't think camera should be in the court. Well, no, that would slightly put you out of work, but you've been in this line of work for more than 40 years. Yes. And I just wanted to ask, because the clip that has gone, or the image rather, I should say, that's gone viral recently, is of the now convicted sex trafficker, Gilein Maxwell, drawing you as you drew her. Yes. That didn't make me nervous. It didn't make you nervous. No, sketchers are fine. I think if she took out a big fat camera and put it into my face, I'd feel a little differently. But was that not quite an odd experience? Because I imagine that doesn't happen that often. No, that does. It did happen to me about 30 years ago, when there was a comedian named Eddie Murphy. I don't know if you know who he is. He did a little sketch of me in a court case. He was the defendant, or he was actually suing, or some kind of dispute with his agent. And he was bobbing up and down and sketching, making fun of me, you know, like pointy. He did a little sketch of me on a little post it. And he gave it to me. And I have it here in my apartment somewhere. I found it within five years. It's still here somewhere. Okay, so once in 30 years, it's definitely not the norm. No, I'm not. So it was odd. You were obviously making eye contact. When did you realize she was sketching you? She had, she was leaning on a piece of paper. She took out a piece of paper and she was going up and down, looking at me, looking at me. So, you know, I knew as she was sketching me, you could tell on somebody's sketch.

15006," She was leaning on a piece of paper. She took out a piece of paper, and she was going up and down, looking at me, looking at me. So I knew as she was sketching me, you could tell when somebody's sketching you. And it didn't put you off. It didn't really put me off, but I felt I better get this, I better sketch this, because now this is what's happening in the courtroom. And I have to draw what I see. Yeah, I was just going to say, I imagine that was pretty meta. You know, you being drawn and her drawing you. And also, do you think there's a kind of, is there a psychological element so that, do you think? There could be a lot of people are throwing in their opinions about what it means and what it meant to her, what she actually was trying to have power. I don't really know. I don't read minds. I can't figure out what she was doing, but I had to draw her. And I was really happy she was looking straight ahead as you may be right now, because a lot of times I'm seated right behind it, and I can't see anything but the back of their head. So if I can get a front view, it's great. A lot of times photographers outside of a courthouse will shout out somebody's name as when they're trying to get their image just so that they get them to turn front view. So it was an important thing for me. And I wanted to keep it going as long as possible. It was great. Well, that seems to be, I mean, did you get to see what she drew? Did she leave it on the table? I did go running out. When I was a break and I went out and ran after her lawyer, I said, can I see, you know, I'd like to know what was she sketching? And she said, you know Jane, I can't discuss that with you. So I really don't know. I never saw it. You're of course drawing as well. And it has been a remarkable time with the pandemic where you have a lot of people's faces now obscured with the mask. How is that be? It's partly easier and partly harder. It depends on who the person, Glenn Maxwell had a great eyebrows and eyes and a good shape pair, because that's all I've got to work with. It made it harder for me to sketch because I use pastels and I'm used to blowing some of the dust off. I'd be going, but then it's in my mask. So it was hard for me to wear a mask and work. By drawing everybody else in a mask, it's not as interesting, I'm sure, to make a portrait of somebody with a mask on, but I had to draw what I saw. Well, some have also felt, you know, it's hidden people's faces at the time where you do normally get certain even, even going into the court. Some people have felt, you know, it's been helpful to those who are on trial in some way. I think it's been hard for a defendants team, the lawyers to pick a jury, because you can't see their faces that's hard to read. You want to pick a certain type, you know, when you're trying to select a jury, I think it really made it hard for them to, people look different when they take their mask off. I was working with a reporter with a mask on and then I saw them outside with no mask. I had no idea that was the same person. No, I know I've had that exact same experience myself, quite a lot of times, and I just want to see and check that I've actually met that person before. With this particular image, because it really did captivate people, I know you're not actually on social media, but this really did go viral. I know you can keep the images as well, that you draw, you submit a scan of them or you give a copy and then you keep the original. Have you been offered money? Oh yeah. Sure, are you going to sell it? No, I'm not selling it yet. I have a collection of almost 43 years of sketches, thousands of them, and there's certain precious ones that I think are more important to me in my collection, to make it all worth whatever, and I don't know, I'm not ready to sell it.

15007,"έI Companies now, they're getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of applications. So software has come in to automate the process. You want to write your resume for robots, not for humans. The only job your resume has is to be comprehensible to the software that is reading it, because that software or robot is going to decide whether or not a human ever gets their eyes on it. These things are programmed by a certain segment of the population that might not be totally inclusive or not being fully aware. Concerns about how this technology could exacerbate discrimination. For the FTC, I think foremost, the FTC needs to be making sure that we're fully understanding this technology. We don't trust companies to self-regulate when it comes to pollution. We don't trust them to self-regulate when it comes to workplace comp. Why on earth would we trust them to self-regulate AI? Just about something you were saying, though, with Gilein, which I think speaks to your work, is that you've got to draw what you see. It's obvious that you have had to take the emotion out of it. Take my emotion out of it. Yeah, exactly. Because if somebody else shows emotion, I do have to put that in. But I have to capture their emotion, but I have to try to not let my feelings go into the drawing, which sometimes I do have reactions on some cases. Sometimes I feel like I cry sometimes. And tears are really bad for pastels. I just tried to be neutral and journalistic. I witnessed some horrific cases and I see horrible crime scene photos. Like I just did a Derek Chauvin case. I watched that tape over and over because it was shown from several different angles. And it was really hard for me to do that. I had to look. I had to look. I had to draw it. I couldn't look away. People have an instinct to look away from a horrific scene like that, but I had to really study the face. It was just horrible to watch somebody die over and over and over. What impact has your work had on you in your life outside the court? I think I do painting as well. And my subject matter is not crime. And it's just these escapes of just more pleasant things, I think. I don't want to see or watch any crime scene movies. I just need to get escaped. I don't touch pastels when I leave court. I only will use oils in my painting. Right. Because I imagine some of what you've been exposed to. I don't know if it's made you. But has it changed the way you feel towards people? Do you sometimes think about the worst things you've seen and heard and maybe struggle to trust people or think of the bad things people can do? I try. It's hard. People's faces don't, as I was saying to somebody about Bernie made off. He looked like such a kind old gentleman. It would be so easy to just fall prey to him and give him all your money and trust him. You can't really always tell by somebody's face what they're really like inside. That's maybe something I've learned from trials, watching people. You can't always tell. There's a brilliant con artist out there who just can mask their true self and just have to be careful. Have you ever been frightened in court? I was once, I was sketching a group of, I think there were the Embassy bombers. It was a group of terrorists and there were a lot of them and they sat them all inside the jury box because they had nowhere else to put them. They let me sit in the well, which is where the tables for the lawyers would be. I was sketching and one of the defendants jumped out.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3293,2022-10-15 20:15:07
15008," that in the well, which is where the tables for the lawyers would be. And I was sketching, and one of the defendants jumped out of the well, leapt over. It was sort of like, I think I'd just seen a Tarzan movie with my son. And he leapt over with both arms, took his feet, and started running across the courtroom, and the judge stood up and pressed the panic button, and the marshals were standing in the back and started running up and tackled the guy against the wall right next to me. It was terrifying. I got on the floor. I held my past L-box. I was really afraid, which is resting on a little tripod next to me. I did not want that to go on the floor, and I just squatted down on the floor next to that. So that was a pretty odd thing. Yeah, well, I mean, if you are regularly in the room with big criminals, something, at some point, I'm sure, is going to go down. That was the time that it went down, right? And I had never been allowed in to sit where I was sitting again. They always... Then it was just a time where they just were extra cautious since that point about where they let anybody sit. What's it like sitting opposite household names? I'm thinking, R-kelly, and to an extent, Harvey Weinstein. Okay, household name. These are all sex predators. So it's the me-to era of a lot of the cases I've been covering. There are so many me-to's. What's it like? I don't know, I think they're all perverted in different ways. Like Weinstein, you know, they... I think when people have a lot of money, power, and fame, it corrupts them, and they just become deviance. Is it right? I mean, I don't know if this is right, but Weinstein asked for more hair in one of your drawings? Oh, yeah, he did. I was sitting in an aisle seat, and he was walking out with his lawyers, and he looked over at my sketch, and he said, can't you give me more hair? I just kept drawing, and I did not give him more hair. You know what, I mean, imagine as a woman, and also someone who just heard the details you just heard, but he's also still going to be someone who's used to power, that that is not something you would respond to pretty well. He's not going to have power over me, so I did not give him more hair. Although, many, many years ago, John Gotti did ask me to shave off his chin a little, double chin, and I did do that. Oh, why? We scattered of him. Scared of him? I don't think I was directly afraid of him, but there were a lot of mob trials back then in the 80s. A lot of them. I was surrounded by a lot of mafia people back then. That was like me too now, back then it was a mafia trials. Commission trial, John Gotti, the pizza connection trial, I can't remember. They went, there were constantly, there are five different families in New York, and there were so many trials, and they were switching, I couldn't even follow it anymore. They were switching power, like Gotti had, during the Commission trial, one of the defendants there, vanished because Gotti had taken him out, and then he rose to power. That was a whole different era. It's interesting that there would have been phases like that. The mobs now me too. Yes, that seems to be the way the news works. It's not, I can't even think of a mafia trial I had covered recently, maybe six years ago. Nobody seems to care anymore. Now it's me too, me too, me too. There was an era of financial crimes, there was Martha Stewart and Bernie Matov, and there were a lot of financial crimes for a while. And then terrorists was a big theme for a while. Have you ever, I mean, a lot of the people you've mentioned don't get out of jail, some of them will of course. Have you ever met them in real life? Once they get out of jail, they probably served such a long sense that, I don't know, I've never met them after their trials. That's, I'm usually on to the next trial. How long do you have to make the drawing? That all depends on if it's an arraignment. Somebody during the Boston Marathon bombing arraignment.

15009," the drawing. That all depends on if it's an arraignment. Somebody during the Boston Marathon bombing arraignment. He was there for six minutes. People timed it. I usually have no idea because I lose track of time and everything. I'm just so, arraimets go very quickly. And in six minutes, I have to get as much information down as I can and then flush it out from my memory. Finish it up. I can't obviously complete it in six minutes, but I have to have as much information as I can get. And sometimes I have a witness, the same witness on a, a, a, a amount of trial. They may be on the stand for days, the same person. So I have a lot more time. I might do a wide shot with a lot of people in it. Take my time. I might do a wide try to tie a shot of, it varies. So everything depends on what I'm covering that day and how much time I've got. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think Jay Powell said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up. This is Bluewood Wall Street week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From businesses most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it at the bull park. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we haven't had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. Tag on the product may read made in the USA, but the sign on the CEO's door often says made in India. Alpha Beth Sundart Pachai, Microsoft Sacha Nadella, IBM's Arvind Krishna, Micron Technologies Sanjay Mayhotra, and that's just the start. Added in the chief executives of Adobe, Deloitte, Gap, VMware, and that doesn't count Indians running companies all over the world. Why have so many Indians risen to the top? For no coastal appoints to India's incredibly competitive education system, if you can survive the pressure it takes to get into one of the Indian institutes of technology, it gives you confidence to handle American universities and later the business world. Meanwhile, the belief in India's ability to produce so many tech wizards is reinforced every year. Indians make up about three-force of the immigrants receiving coveted H1B visas for the US, and it's a safe bet that some of them will eventually find their way to the sea suite. And early on I believe you drew one of the first people to be executed by electric chair in Alabama when it reintroduced the death penalty, John Evans. What was that like, and how did it impact you? It was pretty awful. This the equipment malfunctioned, the flames came out of the knee pad, they came out of the helmet, and I think they had to redo it a few times. I felt, I looked around the, you don't see who pulls the switch, and I look around the room and nobody's, you know, people are hands behind the back. I felt very responsible, like I did it. My hands felt dirty. And then I remember driving home during a thunder lightning storm, I had to go another hour away to get to where I was staying and driving through puddles, torrential rainstorm, and I felt like this is a message from the higher power, and I felt like, I don't want to be part of murder. I think murder is wrong. I don't think the government should be doing murder, and I don't want to do it. I don't believe in the death penalty. So that was that in terms of those drawings. That was the only time I covered the electrocution. And yeah. Wow. There are other horrible things, as I just told you about Derek Chauvin trial, that was pretty hard to watch. And I suppose being in New York as well, there's a particular, as you've described, there's a particular level of crime at times, you know, with the mafia, a lot of violence, there's been a lot that you've had to see. And then you also have the celebrities because a lot of the time, this is where this happens. Well, New York City is running a violence going on all the time now, more than ever. Even that's why I'm not playing there painting on the streets of the city anymore. I don't feel comfortable standing out there, putting an easel up and getting lost in an easel. I don't know who's going to come up behind me. There's a lot of emotionally disturbed people and there's a lot of violence and it's just horrific and the city is changing.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3295,2022-10-15 20:24:01
15010," violence and it's just horrific and the city is changing and it needs to get fixed. It's pretty bad right now in New York City. So the trials I'm seeing I feel safe. I'm usually there's a lot of court officers or marshals or CSOs standing around. I feel like I'm safe to draw there. It's not like sitting on a subway where somebody could get angry if I'm sketching them. Nobody's going to come attack me. You went viral again. I mean maybe you've been viral lots of times and you don't know because you're not social media but there was also another time which I think smart at all at the time because of your depiction of Tom Brady, the American footballer, in court over a cheating accusation, people saying that your picture didn't look like him. I mean that's not the same of course as having art critics look at your art for art's sake. It's a kind of different lens on it but does that upset you? Does that bother you? It did back then a lot but I think I learned I had a lot of emails and there was fan who, it depended on what team you're rooting for because some people love the sketch and some people like how could I make him look so ugly? You know I didn't, I don't tend to flatter people when I'm doing quick courtroom sketches. Well I'd imagine that not a lot of them look their best either. It's their day in court. That's right. They just come in, the fluorescent lights and they get this over with, get me out of here. Have you ever been surprised by a famous person coming in who doesn't actually really look like you thought they would? I just at the moment remembered Uma Thurman coming to court who's very beautiful and she sat down in the witness box and nobody would ever think the sketch I made was her because you know she's not looking glamorous and I'm sure there have been a lot of these, I just can't remember them. You've mentioned around your work and how important it is to capture what's going on and for you I can tell it it's a very important part of the justice system and transparency but what do you say to those who think it's time for cameras? Well as I said in the beginning I don't really like being on camera, I'm not comfortable with it. I think it gives a lot of power in an editing room to the media. They can make people don't, when they see something on camera they believe that's the truth. It's a photo, they don't lie but there is power in the way things are edited. Things can be shown clips of certain expressions that may not show the truth. When a sketch is shown I don't think people have that, oh this is the truth, this is where it just captures a feeling of what's going on. I think you have to watch out with cameras in the court. They may be quiet or now they're not as obtrusive, they don't make loud clicking noises anymore, all that may be true but what is true? What is the truth? Well I mean your country where I am, this has been a big thing. What is truth? Post truth there are those sorts of things. I suppose it's one of those debates isn't it? And I'm interested as well as a journalist because of transparency and courts and how we best do that. Well courtrooms are open to the public. People are allowed to come in and watch trials. They're not sealed off unless it's a sealed case. And if the camera's running 24-7 in the courtroom maybe that will give more information but TV news tends to edit clips of what they think is the story they want to tell. And if the judge is yawning they may show that and say oh he's not paying attention and you know anything could happen. And I think if there probably are witnesses like me who don't feel comfortable in front of a camera. Yeah and I also fix him of course as well. Victims of course. I can't even sketch their likes because I'm not permitted. I'm not permitted to sketch their face. So I have to during Galen Maxwell and Weinstein and plenty of cases. I've had to draw featureless faces. So I can get the gesture maybe the tears, hands, hair but no I can't really, I can't let their whole likeness show where somebody could pick the mountain to say oh I know. And jurors I can't show their face too especially",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3296,2022-10-15 20:28:16

I mean, in the case of Gilei Maxwell bringing it back up, a lot of people make a big thing of the person looks like when they're found guilty. People want to read into that moment, don't they? Do you draw that exact moment, that response to the verdict? I'm watching what's going on and if she broke down crying, yeah, I would draw that moment, but she didn't really have any reaction at that moment that I could see. Is that quite common? Yes, it's common. As people don't always react, maybe they're in shock, I don't know. Yeah, what a moment. What many moments you've been in in people's lives, recording the biggest moment in many ways, often for the very worst reasons, but sometimes they are exonerated as well, of course, and that will be a very important moment as well. Speaking of Mafia Truss, the last one I did, he was exonerated in the courtroom, erupted with his fans, like cheering, yay, they ran out, celebrating, so that's rare though. Yeah. Jane, if you could do it all again, do you think you'd go into this line of work, knowing what you know about it? Yes, I do love what I do. I think I'm very lucky. I love drawing people. I'm very lucky. I found a way to earn a living doing it and feel safe, and I love it, and I would do it all over again, yes. Well, I've loved talking to you. Thank you so much for letting us in and letting me and us turn the camera on to you and focus on you for a bit, but we'll let you get back to focusing on others. Thank you so much. Okay. And thank you so much for being with us until we meet again. Take care and goodbye. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Since reducing trade isn't a likely option, what about a technological improvement to help reduce the emissions from these well stock maritime behemoths? What separates a great investor from an average investor? Is it an early affinity for markets? I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock votes. An unconventional path? What I really wanted to do was ski, so I left Wharton and I went up the main and became ski bump. A never-ending thirst for knowledge? It is a constant education each and every day. An acute attention to detail. I was down there for three weeks, I met every tenant, I was counting the car traffic, I was learning the business. A willingness to take a risk? If you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk. Where the ability to recognize a mistake and move on. I don't mind a 90% chance probability of failure, if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. In how to invest, I hope to provide a glimpse into the thoughts and practices of the world's great investors and hopefully inspire a new generation of professional investors. In my pursuit of identifying the traits and skills of a great investor, I first looked into their backgrounds. I found many were raised in blue collar or middle class families, rarely where they from fabulously wealthy families or families where there was a history of investing professionally. But their path to a career and investing varied. Some like Ron Barron, the mutual fund manager and investor with more than $50 billion on her management started investing as a teenager. After my bar mitzo, I was interested stock market because I had friends of mine who had been given stock from the grandparents who were prosperous. In Eastman, Kodak and Polaroid. I said, I want to do that. My father said, we can't invest in stocks. We've never done that. In fact, one of the ideas behind my business is the idea was I wanted to be able to have people like my parents be able to invest in the stock market. I saw that and then he said, well, I had $1,000 at the time and he said, well, if you show me why you want to invest in a company and you put all your money into one company, then show me why. Then I'll let you do that and open account for you. And so I did research. I would go to this brokerage firm and it was called McDonald's company or from Cleveland. They were right by Asbury Park High School. I would go there after school, sports and girls and stocks. I would go there after school and all these guys, old guys, 40, 50 years old. They're sitting there on these green chairs and looking at the tape that hardly moved. I think the New York Stock Exchange was 25 million shares a day and maybe American was a million or two million shares a day. So look at it. I got a report on this Mom with County National Bank and I started reading it and it was around the corner where I lived in Alan Hurst outside of Asbury Park and I told my father why I want to invest in it and he let me invest and the stock was $10 a share, 100 shares. And then the stock every day for the next six months, seven months, every day, did they stay the same or went up and eighth and it was printed the 15 stocks in the Asbury Park press and everybody said the same. And then it got acquired at $17 a share. So my $1,000 became $1,700. I said, man, there's nothing to do if I want to do that. So I was interested. Hedge Fund billionaire Ken Griffin also turned an early affinity for math and computers into an early career in stock trading. Let's talk about your background before you started Sadell. You're born in Florida? I was born in Daytona Beach. My father worked on the space program back in the 1960s. But I spent my four minute years in middle school and high school in Buckeur, Tone, Florida. And you were a pretty good math student and I'm told a computer nerd as well. Is that fair or unfair? Well, I appreciate the compliment because to be a computer nerd has obviously turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and has had a",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3298,2022-10-15 20:37:10
15013," It turned out to be a pretty good place to be in life. And yes, I was very interested in both mathematics and programming in high school. And it's defined my career and it has had a very important role in my life. So you went to Harvard College. Most students there are taking courses or their athletics, but you were going to be doing that. But you were also trading securities. Is that true? That is true. I started a small partnership my second year at Harvard to engage in convertible bond arbitrage, which was a bit of an off-the-beaten path occupation for a kid in college. But I had a great fascination with markets. And I had an opportunity to invest capital markets in my college days. And it was an incredible opportunity. It was a really great learning experience. But in those days, it wasn't common to be able to get stock prices instantly. You had to get a special terminal or special intended to let you get the stock quotes. Is that right? So it's amazing. I love the line people go, well, that's how we've always done it. And I get to think back into the early days of Citadel. We always did it. We used a fax machine, which you and I, of course, have memories of. And the fax machine was revolutionary. In the 1980s, real-time stock prices were actually difficult to receive. And I put a satellite dish on top of the dorm room so I would have access to real-time stock quotes in managing the portfolio that I managed. And what did the Harvard people say? Interestingly enough, back in the 80s, Harvard had a general prohibition on commercial activity in your dorm rooms. So I had to go to the building superintendent to get an exception to put the satellite dish on the roof of the building. And fortunately, he was willing to grant me that exception. But not every investor saw their future in finance early. Real estate, Titan, Sam Zell, and myself studied the law, became lawyers, and hated it. I was always a good enough academic to get from here to there. So when I wanted to go to law school, I got seven A's. But I didn't get very many A's before that. And I basically used the four years of being an undergraduate to build a real estate business and build other businesses. And I just had a great time. So you were doing some real estate on the side while you were in college. And then you went to University of Michigan Law School. And to please your mother or father, you said, I'm going to go to law school. But you weren't that interested in being a lawyer? No. Never. As a matter of fact, I ended up graduating and becoming a lawyer. And I practiced for four days. Four days? That's, I didn't realize you practiced that long. Four days. Four days. And so in the morning of the fifth day, I went to see a senior partner. And as only a 24-year-old could do, I looked in and I said, I just don't think this is a good use of my time. He said, OK, there's the door. Well, actually, what he said is, what are you going to do? And I said, I'm just going to go back to doing deals like I did when I was in law school and in the real estate business in Ann Arbor. And so he said, why don't you stay here and we'll do the legal work and we'll invest in your deals. And so that's what we did for a year. And then there's activist investor Nelson Peltz, who didn't see the point in studying at all. What I really wanted to do was ski. So I left Wharton and I went up to Maine and became a ski bump. What did your family say? Nelson, we really wanted you to go to Wharton and be a good student. You're one of ski. I mean, that's not what you're supposed to do. That's correct. They did say that. What did you do? You said I was skiing. My father was an amazing guy. He wasn't happy that I left Wharton. He wasn't happy that I was a ski bump. And he wasn't happy that I grew a beard. But I did all of those things. And the snow melted in late spring and came back and I had a summer job offered to me in Mount Hood, Argonne to help them and teach racing to young kids in Mount Hood, Argonne. And I needed some money to get out there. I asked him if he'd give me a job on a truck 100 bucks a week, two weeks, that was all I needed. He said, fine, shave your beard off and do it. I said, I would. It was only temporary. So I shaved my beard off. And after about a week on the job, I started telling things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, one on two.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3299,2022-10-15 20:41:47
15014," About a week on the job, I started telling him things that I thought that were missed opportunities. And he set me up beautifully. He said, why don't you stay here and do what you want to do instead of going out to Mount Huracan? Well, I did. And that's what happened. There are also great investors like Paula Volent, one of the country's most successful endowment heads, who came to investing after a completely different career. I studied paper conservation, restoring prints and drawings. I worked at the New York Historical Society for a while there. I then went to work at the Palace of Fine Arts in their Conservation Lab, and then I went to Los Angeles, where I worked at the LA County Museum. I did scientific work at the Getty, and then I set up my own conservation studio, where I worked with contemporary artists like Edward Shay, St. Francis. And I was running my own business, and I realized I needed to know a little bit about finance, because I was working with very expensive works of art. I was running a studio. And so I started taking a couple of business classes at UCLA, and through that I got introduced to Yale School of Management. But I got into Yale School of Management at the same time I got offered a fellowship at the National Gallery of Art, where you and I both serve the Lyscher Fellow, and I worked in the Paper Conservation Lab there, combining paper and paintings techniques for conservation on contemporary works of art. So you did that for a while, and then you went to Yale School of Management? My husband and I had been trying to have a child, and it wasn't kind of works. It wasn't happening, so he said, okay, well let's move to New Haven. And of course that was instant, and my daughter was born after my first semester. So I took a break, and when my daughter was probably two months old, I went to David Swenson and knocked on the door, and said, hi, I want to learn about endowment, because I'm going to work at a museum. And this is about David. David looked at my resume. There was no finance at all. And he took me in, and I started filing and helping organize things, and little by little I got projects to do. I remember he had me do a big research on soft dollars, so that was one project I worked on. And little by little I became incorporated into the investment office. Coming up, we hear about the extreme intelligence and intention to detail that it takes for success on Wall Street. One of Sam's favorite samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. Hydrogen has a very special place in the universe. It's the first element on the periodic table. It is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find, which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels, they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these, we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things where you just need a good old fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the roads today won electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Building to cross America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3300,2022-10-15 20:45:18
15015," It says that might not be really grounded as well as it should be in facts. Attention to detail also sets great investors apart as described by two real estate legends, Sam Zell and John Gray. You know, one of Sam's favorite Samisms is we suffer from knowing the numbers. I think we've managed to tip through the tulips for the last 50 years by never allowing ourselves to get swept up in the enthusiasm of whatever the current event might be. And I think by maintaining that level of discipline, yeah, we made mistakes, and that's to be expected. But we've all been, quote, controllable. No one mistake was ever catastrophic. The first deal I worked on was a shopping center in Chesapeake, Virginia, the Great Bridge Shopping Center. It was a $6 million transaction. We borrowed four, so it was a $2 million equity check. And you would have thought I was buying the island of Manhattan. I mean, I was down there for three weeks. I met every tenant. I was counting the car traffic. I was learning the business. And it was an amazing experience because I was the chief bottle washer. I was the waiter. I was the matrede. Because we were this tiny little business, and I was learning it firsthand. Now one of the most famous sayings in the real estate world is location, location, location, meaning that the location is everything. And also you might say it's local, local, local, because most people make in real estate investments kind of in the area they know. You've made investments all over the world. How do you sitting in New York know about their value of real estate in Europe or in Asia and how hard has that been to build a global business? So I think the key to that is to have a global footprint, to have hundreds of people all over the world. And it took us a long time to do it. I mean, we've been at this for 30 years, and you really need talented people on the ground. You need local people who know the markets. The one thing I'd say though that is advantageous about real estate is so many of the trends we're seeing, particularly driven by technology, are the same around the world. So when we started buying warehouses back in 2010, and we noticed that there were these e-commerce tenants showing up, and we started buying more in the US, it wasn't a big leap of faith to say the same thing is going to happen in Canada, it's going to happen in the UK and continental Europe and across Asia. So my view is that if you have the skill set, you can evaluate plus you travel a lot, like you, I'm on planes a lot. I no longer run the real estate business day today. My colleagues Ken Kaplan and Kathleen McCarthy have done an amazing job, but they have teams around the world on the ground, and we're local in those markets, and I think that's really important. You cannot buy real estate in Mumbai the way we have flying in and flying out of New York. Next, we look at how skilled investors evaluate risk. We are 100% confident every time we make the investment that it's going to be a big company. We are wrong a lot of the time. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling. You will be the first chief crypto officer, because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news.

This is Bloomberg Daybreak with Lake. Welcome to Daybreak Australia. This is Bloomberg Technology. Welcome to Bloomberg crypto.

15016," One of the easiest paths in life is to accept and follow conventional wisdom. But what great investors have found is that path doesn't lead to easy returns. Often, the biggest winds come from going against the grain and taking a risk, especially if you are leading venture capital investor like Mark Andreessen or Vinod Kostler. Which top-end venture firm has its own bar, so it has its own set of criteria for things that you should be done or not. And then the top-tier venture firms as a group have a collective bar, which is a top-tier venture firm going to fund this company or not. It's actually easier to answer that second question than it is the first question. After you've been in the business for a while, you tend to have a sense of like, okay, this is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm or it's not. If it is going to get funded by a top-end venture capital firm, and if my firm doesn't think it's a good idea, you do wonder who's right, because the other firms are quite smart. So this is one of the regular discussions that we have, which is like, okay, if another one of these top-end firms is interested in it, that might be a very positive substantive signal. If the other top-end firms have looked at it and all passed, that might be a substantive negative signal. That said, some of the best deals in history have been passed on by a very large number of people. In one of the class examples, Uber was passed on by a very large number of venture capital firms. Uber was actually available to be invested in on this site called Angelist, where literally anybody with a checkbook can invest. And so every once in a while you get these outliers. And it's fundamentally a game of outliers. The money is made on the aberrations. So you want to be generally open-minded and humble about your conclusions about what all these different signals mean. Now a famous economist, Herb Stein, once said, if something can't keep going on forever, it won't. In other words, at some point things settle down. You worry that because the economy might soften at some point if interest rates are raised, or just because of the business cycle, the wonderful world of venture capital will slow down a bit. And is that a worry for you? So it's a cyclical business for sure. It has a history of boom bus cycles, basically just like any other sector of the economy. That's that I guess I would say. We do not have a great track record in our industry of predicting these cycles. And I think most of how we either perform or fail to perform is micro-not macro, which is to say it's based on the successor failure of individual companies. And if you just look at the history of venture capital and startups, many of the best companies have been formed during the hot periods. But also many of the companies have been formed during the cold periods. Right? And they're pros and cons of those periods. And so look, it's possible there's another cyclical boom and bus cycle. Our plan for that cycle would basically be to just keep working with our existing companies, help them through it, keep investing in new companies all the way through. And basically bet on these sort of micro-level fundamental technological and economic changes that continue to happen. Most of what we do is uncharted territory. I would say the one piece that works really well in our business is go for higher risk, higher consequences. So most people in business reduce risk, increase the probability of success, which is reduce risk. But at the expense of making the consequences of success relatively inconsequential, you might make two times your money or something. I, for our business, what works is I don't mind a 90% probability of failure if there's a 10% chance of changing the world. And that's very much the philosophy. It also goes with, it's the right way to make huge impact. It's not just venture capitalists taking risks. Columbia's endowment head Kim Liu also says gains are not without calculated risks. I think the best investment advice I've ever received is the fact that we are in the business of taking risk. And so if you want to produce return, you have to be willing to take risk and you have to be willing to analyze and mitigate that risk the best you can. And to make sure that the return potential of an investment is equal to the risk, but you can't avoid risk. Now, what do you think the most common mistake investors make generally? I think the most common mistakes is following the herd and just doing what everybody else is doing and not making sure that an investment is appropriate for your institution and making sure that the analysis that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are a million ways to make money. I think there are a million stress.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3302,2022-10-15 20:58:34
15017," that someone else has done is not appropriate for you or is not congruent with the way you think about the world. I think there are million ways to make money. I think there are a million strategies that can work. Not every investment is consistent with your strategy. And so I think there's a lot of herd mentality. And that's a huge mistake that happens. Now sometimes risk don't pan out and mistakes are made. Now I might sit and stew over the loss for a decade or two, but a truly great investor, like Kleiner Perkins Chairman John Doerr, has the ability to admit a mistake, cut his losses and move on. When I first came to Silicon Valley, I hung out at Stanford on the second floor of Margaret Jack's Hall. And down that hall was Andy Bechtelshime, who founded Sun Microsystems, John Hennessy, who became president of Stanford, founded MIPS Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics. What I didn't do is go down into the basement. Where Len and Sandy were starting Cisco. So that was a miss on my part. More recently, I had the opportunity to invest in an electric vehicle company. And the conventional wisdom was venture capitalists ought not to invest in electric vehicle companies. Not new car companies at all. There've been 400 new car companies in the nation's history. Every one of them but one has gone bankrupt. But I was still very attracted to the market. And we had the choice of backing a brilliant car designer by the name of Henry Fisker, or ambitious, slightly crazy entrepreneur by the name of Elon Musk. It test well, we made the wrong decision. But Tesla did very, very well. And so did electric vehicles. So when I make a mistake, I only think about it for the next 10 or 20 years. How long does it take for you to get over these things? Well, I don't obsess on these, but I won't ever forget. This is a market that over the past few weeks has made it clear. It wants to go higher. It got a little spooked by the idea that geoportal potential rises. So what happens is that we create some icons, we call them tags. And they have a signal within them. And when you stare at that, your eye responds to it in a particular way. The way in which that eye response occurs is a signal that we pick up on the visual cortex of the brain at the back of the brain. So the sensor is looking for the signals we create here that come through the eyeball, through the brain, and then onto the visual cortex. Once we've got it there as a signal, we can grab that. We understand what that signal looks like, and we can turn that into a command, whatever we're trying to control. So you can go through these things. There's multiple places where we think this technology could be applied, perhaps in driving or commanding, among ground vehicles or among naval vessels. Perhaps providing a menu selection and control within a control room environment, maybe then you could go to a power station, all those kind of things that are perhaps in the daily way of this technology. Innovation, money, and power collide in Silicon Valley and beyond. Bloomberg Technology with Emily Chan.

Searching in vain for solid ground in an escalating Russian war in Ukraine in a troubled global economy and goodness knows in the British authorities economic management. This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This week, Special Intermediator Larry Summers of Harvard on the potential next shoe to drop economically. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. And former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator Christine Todd Whitman on a path forward on nuclear energy. Nuclear, and by a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Global Wall Street spent the week trying to get its footing after things only got worse in Ukraine as Russian missiles rained down across the country. And NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg had to reassure us that things weren't about to go nuclear. Russia knows that the nuclear war cannot be won. And must never be fought. The IMF released its economic projections and its chief economist warned that a global recession just may be looming. What we see is that about a third of the global economy is going to be experiencing a contraction this year or next. And if that weren't enough, President Biden told CNN recession may come specifically to the United States. I don't think there will be a recession. If it is, it'll be a very slight recession. And then the CPI numbers came in hotter than expected with the headline numbers still up at 8.2% and core accelerating to 6.6% year over year. It is not a good picture here. Those who were thinking that inflation might drop off fairly quickly are going to be disappointed by the numbers here. In the meantime, over in Great Britain, we had a week of financial turmoil with a very public battle between the Bank of England and Prime Minister Trust's government, which ended up with a new chancellor of the ex-checker and her giving up on more of her controversial budget. I want to be honest, this is difficult. But we will get through this storm and we will deliver the strong and sustained growth that can transform the prosperity of our country for generations to come. But the surprises weren't all bad this week, at least not for former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke, who was awakened to learn that he shares with two others the Nobel Prize for economics this year. It was completely unexpected. My wife and I shut off our cell phones when we went to bed last night, not thinking about this issue. And it was our daughter in Chicago who was finally contacted, it called us on the landline to inform us that this had happened. And the markets had just as hard a time as the rest of us finding its footing, with the S&P swinging five points between big losses and big gains on Thursday alone, after the CPI numbers came out. For the week, the S&P 500 was down 1.55%, the Nasdaq down over 3% and yield on the 10 year was up over 13 basis points to close the week just above 4%.

You did see the swoon take the S&P C2 below 3517 and I'm not a technician but that level was important because it was the 50% retracement of the post pandemic move higher and that probably kicked in a combination of buying hedges being taken off some short covering and that fed on itself through the end of the day. Maybe you could point to the move down in yields yesterday, the move down in the dollar but that could also help to explain today's weakness too because you saw reversals there. So Joanna Femre and Annoy's I think it's fair to say in the equity markets there but on friday actually they gave up pretty much everything they got back on Thursday so when you net net when you get through it all what did we learn this week that should affect the markets over the longer term? You know David I think what we learned is that there's still a lot of risks out there facing the future of the global economy not just here in the US and those two price reports we got the PPI and the CPI reinforce the view that inflation is going to be a really hard challenge for the Fed to solve. It also seems to have removed any wiggle room that people think the Fed has. They're really going to have to be adamant about raising rates, try to constrain liquidity, try to discourage consumer demand in order for inflation to get under control. There's not a lot of room for them to do anything but raise rates now for the next at least couple of meetings the market finally perhaps is digesting that. Listen there's a lot of talk about sorry go ahead please. Yeah I think Joanne's absolutely right and I think there have been these moments where it seems like whether it's in reaction to things going on in the UK that the markets almost cheering for or looking for some sort of financial system accident because of the messaging from the Fed from Powell that they're not going to step in because of financial market weakness across any of the asset markets or just volatility but financial system instability maybe what could bring the Fed back in but even in a situation like that what they may do is use the tool of their balance sheet or repo facilities versus doing a pivot anytime soon on rates and I'm not sure that's been fully digested by the market yet. Yeah there could be certainly more digest in the comment particularly because the risks that are out there are really unusual you know it's not just the inflation problem right the US has a labor shortage a born of the pandemic born of early retirees born of a lack of legal migration immigration into the US and that problem is not one that the Fed can solve and so they still have very high consumer demand an a shortage of supply no matter what the Fed does to try to curtail demand there's going to be spillovers to also curtailing the recovery of supply from the pandemic so they're sort of fighting this problem without having all the tools that are needed and you know the risks that are out there you know haven't really abated in many ways although finally we're starting to see earnings estimates come down and market expectations adjust to those risks. Lizanne I wonder whether part of the problem we have right now is it's not all bad there are parts of the economy that actually continue to be quite strong it's sort of like we've gone from a unipolar to a multiple world we've gone to a multiple economy it feels like sometimes. We have and I think that's what's particularly unique about the pandemic the nature of it how it unfolded is that we've we've been in this rolling cycle so during the the throws of the pandemic when all the stimulus kicked in both on the monetary side and on the fiscal side that stimulus and demand associated with it was forced to be funneled into the good side of the economy because of the absence of access to services that became the breeding ground for the inflation with which we're still dealing then as you saw reopening you saw that pent down demand on the good side you saw pent up demand on the services side that tends to be the stickier components of inflation so even though we're seeing disinflation now on the good side we've got it on the services side so it's very different than your typical slow down downturn recession whatever you want to determine because at least the last two the COVID recession.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3305,2022-10-15 21:11:19
15020," in the services side. So it's very different than your typical slow down, downturn recession, whatever you want to term it, because at least the last two, the COVID recession, the global financial crisis, in essence, the bottom fell out all at once in the economy. This is happening in a unique way because it's sort of shifting through the economy and hitting pockets at different times. Well, and some areas of the economy are still expanding, even as some parts like PCs and smartphones where a lot was purchased during the years of the pandemic, now those sales coming down, but look at auto production. That industry is still suffering from a lack of the chips needed to finish off cars, and they're putting cars in inventory waiting for that last chip to arrive, for example. And the semiconductor companies that supply them still have a very long runway of demand ahead of them. So there are parts of the economy that are still expanding while others are being hit by lower consumer demand from high inflation, from the change in sentiment from spending on goods to services. So that's why I think it's become very hard to say, well, what kind of a recession might we get? Is it going to be broad-based like recessions in the past? Or is it going to be more specific where lower middle and consumers suffering from the higher interest, suffering from inflation, really curtail their spending like Walmart saw, right? Whereas the higher end retailers are doing fine so far. So it's a very challenging time to forecast where the US economy is going, and how much unemployment might be created because of this constraint on liquidity from the rate increases. That means it's still possible to find potentially investments that do lead to growth over the, even the near term, as some of these industries continue to recover. And you know, Joanne, to your point about the upper end in better shape, as witness by what the retailers are saying, there's also that potential pressure just on psychology because of the wealth effect, given that, even though the excess saving story has merit up the income spectrum, they're also challenged by not just equity market losses, but bond market losses, real estate losses. So I think that's why I think we all have to be careful about extrapolating that excess savings up the income spectrum as a guaranteed feed into the consumption side of the economy. I think even there, there might be some hesitancy. Joanne, last thought here, we all talk about, when is the market going to bond them out? When is the bad news bond about? When do we know we got it all out? We know how to deal with the wealth from here? Well, I think you almost never know that ever. I mean, think about the risk, the global economy is facing, right? It's not just the US and inflation problems globally, right? We have the war in Ukraine, and there are some, maybe low probability, but very large risks, as opposed to with that, and then you have China, and they're continuing zero-COVID policy, which seems to be having rolling disruptions to supply, which don't help our inflation problem. And now we have more of an economic war against China with the latest round of restrictions on exports of semiconductor equipment and high-level chips. And the real question there is, will there be retaliation from China in terms of restrictions against access to the Chinese market, which is still, you know, hope to be one of the fastest growing markets in the world that now we might find that US companies don't get access to that. So we shouldn't assume that the worst is in at this point, and we should expect that markets are going to continue to be volatile as some of those risks get realized or clarified. Your Anfini and Lizanne Saunders will be staying with us as we try to figure out what to do with our money in these turbulent times. Let's come back next on Wall Street Week. I'm Bloomberg. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3306,2022-10-15 21:15:33
15021," So what's the best investment advice you've ever put in? You haven't found anybody. The compound interest, the compounding of returns is an incredible miracle of business, finance, and human existence. Everything you learn is additive every day and if you keep added and don't quit, it's an incredible miracle. And it's not just interest. It was always said about compound interest returns, compound business returns, compound human returns. They're all very additive because you learn every day. And if you keep added, it's very, very helpful. In your observation of investors, what do you think is the biggest mistake that average investors make? Selling it the wrong time. And they sell when the prices go down? Yes. Or, yes. And they're saying, if people have conviction or they invest for the, if they invest for the right reasons, just keep added. Welcome to the world of decentralized finance. Bloomberg's covering all things crypto. The people, the transactions, and the technology. Bloomberg Crypto Tuesdays. Well this was the week when Wall Street got much of what it had been asking for and then decided quite characteristically that it didn't like it. The economy is simmering down as requested. Industrial production took its worst fall in more than a year. Business inventories are rising ominously. And the housing industry's trade association said its members were virtually out of business. That of course was Lewis Ruck has your own Wall Street. We've back in 1981, believe it or not, 41 years ago now when all the markets wanted was a slowing economy and the lower interest rates that they thought would come with that. The big move that week was a romantic comedy. You may not remember it with Bert Reynolds named paternity. And the number one song was Arthur's theme from that Dudley Moore film named Arthur. Now the problems are very different as interest rates are on the way up, not down, and the economy is still very robust by most measures. Still with us are Joe Anfini of advisors, capital management, and Liz Ann Saunders of Charles Schwab. So Joe Annolly, come to you. The question is, what do we do other money in this world? What does it make sense to invest with this much volatility, this much uncertainty? It's really been challenging time for investors and it really depends what sort of time frame you have as an investor. If you're in retirement, what you probably need is some assurance that you're going to be able to get the cash flow you need off of your portfolio. And so one of the things we've done for our clients in that kind of a situation is to create portfolios with above average dividend yields on the one side. And now as bond yields are rising and we've kept our duration relatively short, we've been able to let bonds mature and then re up at higher yields. So one area to go to is some relatively stable companies, whether it's General Mills or an ABV or some of the others in consumer staples and in energy that have dividend yields in the 4, 5, 6 percent range. And that way they can still get that income and they can ride out the volatility in the stock prices and wait this out. And that gives our clients a fair bit of comfort. But it hasn't been easy really for anybody, but that's one way to deal with volatility. Lisanne, what do you recommend these days? Well, first of all, I absolutely agree with Joanne that there's no cookie cutter answer to a question like that. It really does depend on who the investor is. Their risk tolerance, their past experience, their time horizon, whether they're financial risk tolerance and their emotional risk tolerance, whether there's an hour gap between the two or a wide gap between the two. But I think we're in a part of the market cycle right now where you want to actually focus on fundamentals. And I know that sounds trite and sounds what we're always supposed to do. But gone are the days where you could look at segments of the market, components of say big tech and look at it monolithically, make an assumption that they're all going to go up simultaneously. There's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3307,2022-10-15 21:19:55
15022," Simultaneously, there's much more differentiation in the market right now. And I'd say look for where things are dear from a macro perspective. So we have declining earnings revisions in the aggregate. So look for the factor around positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprise. We know we're in a rising interest rate environment. So companies with strong balance sheets, low debt, high cash flow, strong free cash flow, low lower volatility. There's kind of a quality wrapper. And I think that's the best type of approach in this environment. And then the last thing we've suggested for those investors who can do it, if you were a rebalance or based on the calendar, maybe instead of doing it once a year, once a quarter, let your portfolio and the volatility associated with dictate the timing of taking advantage of the volatility by adding into weakness trimming into strength relative to your overall strategic asset allocation. Joanne, what about the possibility of fixed income at this point? I mean, for a long time, you didn't want to be in bonds, given what we were going to have bonds. But those yields have really come up. They're yielding something now. And they do generate cash. It's sort of like dividends, right? Yeah, absolutely right. We're getting in the order of 6 plus percent in yields in our all investment grade fixed income solution. And when you pair that in a balanced strategy with the equity front, you know, you can generate a pretty nice cash flow for clients. And so if you keep duration short and you're really careful about selecting credit quality, because credit spreads have widened here. So you want to be careful that you're not adding risk to the side of your portfolio that it's supposed to be sort of the suspenders on the pants, right? To provide more stability. And so that's one thing we've done and it's helped our clients feel a lot more comfortable in this kind of environment. Liz Anna, you did the point yet where you'd consider duration, but it's going longer duration for the income. So my my colleague Kathy Jones, who's a regular guest on on Bloomberg, she's our fixed income strategist. And in the sort of four-ish percent range, we have suggested you consider lengthening duration. But I agree with everything that Joanne said too. I think there are finally opportunities. We've gone from a from a teen environment. There is no alternative to TIA. There is an alternative and there's income and fixed income again. And there are strategies, a bit more active strategies that you can employ to take advantage of this move up in yields. Even well down the duration spectrum, you're actually generating a yield. If inflation ever came down, we might actually have positive really yields. We're not quite there yet, but I think we'll get there. Well, Liz Anna, I wanted to pick up, that was exactly the point I was going to make, is the challenge is that inflation is so high that even if you're getting those appealing yields on fixed income, you're still losing purchasing power. And so that's why we continue to counsel if the client has appropriate risk tolerances in time horizon. The equity side can help you offset the cost of inflation. For example, one of the stocks in one of these portfolios is McDonald's. Now what you want is to find a company like that that has good cash flow that can continue to pay its dividend, but more importantly, even can raise its dividend year after year. And they just announced this week a 10% increase in their dividend. So you're being compensated, more than compensated for that cost of inflation eroding the purchasing power of your money. And that's something that you're more likely to get on the equity side than you are on the fixed income side. Liz Anna, we're spending so much time on rates and on growth and for that matter, geopolitics and things like Ukraine. What about earnings? We are in earnings season now. We had the first four banks come out this week that they're earnings, which actually were pretty reassuring to a lot of people. Is there a possibility that could help the investor right now to the upside? It's possible. I think the rub though is that even if we end reporting season with some sort of positive beat rate, we have to recognize that estimates have been coming down since the April May period of time, both for the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023. So it has been a lowered bar and much like the second quarter, we're still early, but expectations are that energy pretty much is all the earnings growth. So consensus right now once the quarter is all said and done a month from now or so, you'll have 3% overall S&P earnings growth. We exclude energy that goes down to minus 3%. And if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter, I think.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3308,2022-10-15 21:24:31
15023," And that's, if that's the case, that would be worse than the second quarter. I think the path of least resistance for estimates is still down. I'd also say really important to watch and listen in earning season, not just for did you beat your numbers or your profit margins, what your profit margin outlook. If you're a multinational company, the impact of the incredibly strong dollar, whether you're hedging it or not, the impact of inflation, whether you have a lot of fixed costs or variable costs, what your labor costs are. So I think it's a lot of the details under the surface that are matter as much as just the top line reading. Joanna, are you taking account earnings right now in your investment decisions? What are you anticipating? Well, you know, estimates have come down a lot, you know, as Liz Am was saying. The real question I think around this earning season is going to be guidance. And given the uncertainty and the real risks that are out there, I think companies are going to be extremely cautious. And I think investors expect that. It's really kind of a waiting game. If, when, how large every session will be, how broad it will be. So we're going, investors are going to look to companies to get some clues about that. The companies that are out there on the ground, whether it's a Texas Instruments providing chips to the auto industry, you know, or a company providing chips to Apple. And that guidance, I think, investors are going to learn from. And I don't think they're going to hope for too much. I think we're expecting not very strong guidance for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of companies are going to defer and say, we're going to be more cautious. We're going to cut some costs. We're preparing for things to slow down. And that's, that doesn't necessarily mean you have to change your investment allocations, though. Because if you're in it, not for the next six months, but you're in it for a couple years, three years, five years. Right now we have a lot of stocks that have become relatively inexpensive. So a little hope out there, at least. Thank you so much to Joe Anfini and Liz Anson, it's great to have you with us. Coming up, we're going to take a look at what's happening next week.

The UK will remain the centre of attention both in Europe and globally. Monday, the big question, will the guilt market be able to cope without the recent support provided by the Bank of England or will Governor Bailey be forced to step back in? We've got guilt auctions peppered throughout the week. Wednesday, we get inflation data, we also get housing data. And then on Friday, we get retail sales. Plus, we've got S&P and Moody's, both updating the UK credit rating. We've got earnings also throughout the week. Food giants to know the Nestle are reporting Tuesday on Wednesday. Wednesday, we also see the chip equipment maker ASMR reporting numbers. Pay attention to that one. And then on Thursday, we get ABB Volvo and L'Oreal. A focus on earnings in the week ahead with reports from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Netflix, Tesla and IBM. But also pay close attention to chip equipment maker of LAM research. The semiconductor industry is reeling right now from the Biden administration's new restrictions on doing business with China. Restrictions that hit at a time when the industry was already grappling with a slowdown in demand. Economic data next week include industrial production, housing starts and existing home sales. Elsewhere, shareholders of Spirit Airlines are scheduled to vote on whether to move forward with JetBlue's $3.8 billion offer to buy the company.

We'll talk about the challenges and the opportunities with Christine Todd Whitman, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. This is Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. I think that it's hard to put your head around any narrative. Let's just be honest. We've had sort of a shift in our weaned, some sort of circulation fears. Moment, people were talking about that all day yesterday. Okay, so you're moving in on me quick. Just stradzing me with your fancy hands. I'm going to deal with your night because it's really bothering me. Ah, my night. Yeah, he's a troublemaker. Yeah. What did you get up to this weekend? You know, just robot stuff. A lot of chess. I was practicing for you. I know you're pretty good. Ooh, I don't like that. I will take this. Put it over here here. Not cool. Not cool. All right, I will, I will concede. I can see you. You've got me, Bid. Very good game. Well played. Thank you, sir. Thank you.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3310,2022-10-15 21:32:51
15025,"Вот. consist. Net Zero Emissions. It's a lofty goal, but times are wasting. Just ask John Kerry, President Biden's special climate envoy. Many companies are making promises to be net zero by 2050. But the reality is, unless you do enough between now and 2030, you can't hit net zero 2050. And if we're really going to get there, Bill Gates says the math makes a pretty compelling case for nuclear power. You get a million times much energy per reaction as you do burning hydrocarbons. And so it's very advantaged if you do the design right. Nuclear physicist and former energy secretary Ernest Moniz says it won't get done without a public private partnership. I think what we need to see is governments moving together with the financial sector and with the equipment providers to get new power plants over the finish line. But partnership or not, convincing the public about safety may remain an issue, given high profile accidents like Fukushima, Japan, in 2011, when an earthquake led to a disaster at the plant, causing tens of thousands of evacuations. All the nuclear power plants in this country, they operate really on this precipice of normal routine operation on one side and catastrophic accident on the other. It's unclear exactly when you'll fall to one side or the other, but it's certainly possible. So the question is, what will it take, how safe it can be, and how soon can we get there, even for some who initially oppose the idea, but now embrace it. Given this challenge we face today, and given the progress of fourth generation nuclear, go for it. And to give us some answer to these, this is very important questions we turn out to Christine Todd Whitman. She is president of Whitman Strategies. She is, of course, the former governor of the state of New Jersey and the former administrator of the EPA. So welcome to Wall Street Week. Really good to have you with this governor. You've dealt with nuclear energy for years now. So give us your sense of the role of nuclear energy potentially in getting to net zero. Well, I think nuclear can play a huge role, at least in the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. Renewables are not yet based energy. They're peak shaving and we're a 24-7 society, as is the rest of the world. The world is 24-7. And nuclear is the only form of base power that releases no regulated pollutants or greenhouse gases while it's producing power. And we have an incredible safety record here in this country on nuclear. And actually with few obviously very huge exceptions being Chernobyl and what happened in Fukushima Daiishi, overall worldwide, it's been safe and getting safe for all the time. I mean, the U.S. nuclear regulatory commission is considered the gold standard on regulatory oversight of nuclear reactors. I don't think given cost and time that we're going to see any more large reactors built in this country, certainly. They are being built in China. They're being built around the world and we can certainly play a part in developing the parts for those reactors. But I see the future for nuclear right now being in the small modular reactors. Well, let's get to that, and well, first of all, give us a sense of the scope of it already. One of the things that I have learned is nuclear is actually one of the few things that really don't have emissions that can be taken to scale. I think something like 20% of energy in the United States is generated by 70% in France. Right. You know, you saw, in an example of what happens when you take nuclear offline, when California took the Senate, and no free, nuclear reactor offline, their emissions went up and the cost of their energy went up. I mean, it was totally counter to everything that they were hoping to achieve in my mind. And so what I found over time is that you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer their very real questions. I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And so that the resistance policy crisis will come back to this and again mightcus of new",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3311,2022-10-15 21:37:48
15026," If you have an opportunity to talk to people and answer, there are very real questions. I mean, it's normal to have questions about the safety and you should ask them. But the answers are really good. And they're based on our history. You can prove that in fact, these things work. And once you do that with people, they get much more comfortable with the idea of nuclear. It's just that for so long. It's been used as frankly a fundraiser a lot in a lot of times for the environmental groups. And we need to get the public to understand, particularly with the new small modular reactors that are built in a contained facility. They can be placed on site. They're much safer technology. They are a much safer way to produce the nuclear energy. So overall, they are really, I believe, have the potential to make a huge difference. Particularly if you think about the rural parts of America, where you're not on the grid or you're not close to the grid, you can take a small modular reactor and provide power for an entire town or an entire business. So they have a lot of potential there. So let's pursue that question of safety because that is on a lot of people's minds without a doubt. And as you've mentioned, we've had some horrific instances. Is the issue with safety that people don't realize that actually the track record is quite good for nuclear or is it technological development such as you're referring to small module reactors? No, I think it's because people just don't know. They don't understand. I mean, I get a lot of questions I used to in the past about, well, what about the spent rods? And first of all, I tell them from all that, when the time when we had 102 nuclear reactors in this country, and you took all those spent rods and you put them in one place, you fill up one foot fall field to the height of the goalposts. They may have gotten slightly above that now because this was data from several years ago. But the point being it's not this massive thing, this size of the state of Vermont that people kind of have in their minds. And the other thing is that what's in those spent rods is 97 to 90% fishable material, meaning unused energy. And in France and Japan, they figured out how to reprocess that and to get the energy out of those rods, rendering that what you have is the, quote unquote, bad stuff, to down to 15%. Let's say, and it can't be used in a nuclear weapon. So it's much easier to store, much less to store. You have a lot of unused power just sitting there in these spent rods. And we should be using that technology as well. And people have to understand, and when you explain it to them, you can't take one of these rods from a nuclear reactor and put it in a missile. It's not the same technology. It won't work that way. And the other thing that you explained to them because one of the most immediate issues that we had in this country was three mile island. And when that went down, the operators in the utility itself in the reactor itself were never exposed to high levels of radiation. And they've been tracked ever since. And there were no releases into the community. And even those who were right there in the reactor had no adverse reaction to what happened. And in fact, it was because they overrode the system really that you had the partial meltdown, Fukushima Daiishi. That wasn't because of the earthquake, it was because of the tsunami. And that was because they had their backup power, their generator located physically in the reactor building. After 9-11, our nuclear regulatory commission said to our nuclear industry, you've got to move those out. They cannot be co-located with the reactor itself. So we, that kind of thing can't happen here anymore. Just this week, we saw an announcement of a deal to acquire Westinghouse Electric. Basically, on the premise, then, in fact, we're going to have more nuclear energy. Do you anticipate at that in the United States? Well, I certainly hope we do, but it was not even 10 years ago. I guess there were two, four proposed reactors, two in Georgia and two in South Carolina. And we were very hopeful that those were going to come in on budget and on time. And they both ran over and the utilities decided in each case that it just wasn't worth going forward. So it is a question of cost and regulatory hurdles. But you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and make sure things are safe and streamline how you up.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3312,2022-10-15 21:41:59
15027," cost and regulatory hurdles, but you want to have those regulations in place, because that's what protects the community and makes sure that things are safe and streamline how you approach them so that you make them go through all the hoops they have to for safety, but to put it to the front of the line to get this power online. The big problem we have, though, when you talk about all of this is the grid itself. It's old. It needs to be revamped. It can't handle a lot of new power coming in, and that's one of the big challenges that seems to get over overlooked a lot when we're talking about these issues. Again, you go back to small modular reactors, which can actually function on their own. What about the grid? Are we investing in the grid? We have the bipartisan infrastructure bill. We also have the so-called inflation reduction act, which had money in there as well. Is there money in there for the grid? Is it enough? There is money in there for the grid, whether it's enough or not. I doubt it. Hopefully the money that's there will be spent in a way that ensures that nothing is wasted because we need every penny of it. Certainly, every penny that's in there is needed to get the grid updated and to where it needs to be in order to accept the new power, whether it's from nuclear or renewables. I mean, they're going to depend on that as well. Okay, Governor, thank you so very much for being with us. Really appreciate this former Governor Christine Todd Whitman now with Whitman's strategy. My pleasure. Coming up, we wrap up the week with our special contributor Larry Summers of Harvard. Let's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. Imagine simply climbing a cable into space. The concept is known as the space elevator. Not only could it significantly change how we leave planet Earth, but it could also completely transform humanity's relationship with space. And they're a scientist who think we could have already built it. We have the material, we have the technology, we have the lasers, we have the climbers, we have all of it. If a private entity wants to build it or a government, they can build it. It'll change society. We have no clue how colonizing in the space, how really spreading on this space really changed our society over the next 50 to 200 years. It'll be completely different. This is Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. Welcome. Once again, our very special contributor to Wall Street Week. He is Larry Summers of Harvard. So Larry, we got the CPI numbers in that we'd waited for this week. And boy, they came in, how did it expect it? It's been doing this repeatedly now. What do you read in these numbers? Not so much hotter than I expected. Inflations got a lot of momentum. The best single measure to look at for inflation is a kind of super core measure, which is wages. Or you can look at the median component of inflation. They've just been running strong for a long time and not decelerating. So I think team transitory is engaged in a lot of.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3313,2022-10-15 21:45:34
15028," for a long time and not decelerating. So I think Team Transitory is engaged in a lot of wishful thinking. And I must say that I'm struck by the hypocrisy of some friends of mine like Paul Krugman, who are very quick now to focus on housing and the fact that the private indices lead the public indices when the private indices are looking soft, but we're entirely unwilling to credit that argument or to pay attention to the private indices some months ago when the private indices were obviously pointing to an acceleration of inflation. So I think we've got to be very, very careful here if we want to be credible about containing inflation. How much momentum is built into inflation? And how can you tell? What are you looking at right now that are telling you what happens in the fourth quarter and as we go into next year? I'm looking at core measures. I'm looking at super core measures that take housing out, take use cars out in addition to taking food and energy out. I'm looking at the so-called median inflation component. Whatever product it is that's right in the middle. I'm looking at the so-called trimmed mean that looks at the middle half of the distribution of product prices. And very crucially for me, I'm looking at wages which is a kind of super core measure because labor goes into everything. And all of those are saying that inflation is not really coming down very fast, if it's coming down at all, and that it's way above the 2% target or any acceptable level. Besides the CPI numbers, Larry, a very big story throughout the week has been and continues to be great Britain. Where you had the Bank of England come in with their emergency buying of long-term guilt that is due to expire on Friday the end of this week. Same time we now have Liz Truss coming out and making some changes. Give us your take on what's going on in the British economy and more importantly the management of the British economy. Look, I think this is probably going to be a textbook case of crisis creation followed by crisis mismanagement. I'd be surprised if we were in the 7th inning of this particular set of challenges. I had said before that people now I think understand very clearly that when you do a military intervention you should never give a sunset date when you're going to leave because it just emboldens the opposition. I think something similar is true of last resort finance where the kind of deadline the Bank of England gave I think is asking for trouble down the road. So I think we're going to see more tremors, more aftershocks, more problems. At the same time I think we need to recognize that as serious as the British policy errors were this might well not have happened if global economic conditions were more normal. And the kind of excesses we've had in the system mean we're in very complicated territory. Well exactly Larry, I guess I'm asking to say we have global, slow down IMF this week came out and said we're looking at a global slow down at the same time. We have central banks in the development countries really all raising rates at the same time. What is the likelihood we're going to see similar won't be the same but similar sorts of problems elsewhere. Particularly when it comes to very highly leveraged places and places that are more difficult to see some of the private credit, some of the non bank banks. I doubt we've seen the last mine go off. Some of them may be in the private sector. I think more of them may be international. You know something that disappointed me at the IMF World Bank meetings this week was the number of countries who were reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sorted.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3314,2022-10-15 21:50:04
15029," The number of countries who are reporting that they're having substantial difficulty in getting market access. And I must say I'm sort of disappointed by official sector people, people from the ministries of finance and the central banks who are talking about how we're going to work with the private sector to catalyze trillions of dollars of finance for green transitions in all these countries. I don't seem to be doing anything about the fact that many of these countries can't even issue a bond today. So I think there's a whole set of very important challenges with respect to developing countries and emerging markets. And I'd have to say that I don't feel those challenges were really met this week. There are some fires burning and fire department is still mostly in the station. So as we speak to you, you are in Washington for those IMF World Bank meetings and the IAF as a practical matter. You were very outspoken in a project syndicate piece also actually speaking with David Malpest, they had the World Bank about the role of the World Bank right now on things like sustainability. What is going on there is the World Bank playing the role it should be playing and what should it be doing? You know, I think it is playing its usual roles in its usual way. And I think generally the economic crisis of the moment demands major changes in approach just as the security crisis in Ukraine demanded major changes in approach. And we're not really quite seeing it yet. The World Bank needs to be much more aggressive in the use of its balance sheet and it also needs to get much more capital. And instead of having a fight about which of those two things is more important, we need to do both of them. Because the one mistake we're certain not to make is over investing in the green transition. And so we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to support that transition. If there is a lack there Larry often that lack comes from a lack of leadership. Do we not have the leadership we need either from the United States Treasury, the White House or from that matter at the World Bank? I mean, would you ever consider taking over that role? I think that we do need leadership that points towards larger changes in business as usual than we're seeing in the financial area. I think there's some mistakes being made right now at a very, very difficult moment in Africa, at a very, very difficult moment in Latin America, at a very, very difficult moment in parts of Asia. Larry, one piece of news which was actually really hit the markets but has not gotten too much attention is what the United States did was put to semiconductors and China. And so the chips market really went down substantially and it took a lot of the tech with it at a time of so much difficulty globally. What are the possible effects of those sorts of trade actions? You know, the kind of large-style cut-off on cooperation and semiconductors that the Biden administration announced. I think it's possible to pass an overall judgment on that without understanding the security risks that they saw which depend on classified information, which those of us on the outside don't have. But this was a highly consequential increase in economic aggressiveness. This is different than a trade fight over a specific product or a specific trade practice. This was pretty across the board effort in something that's very, very difficult to challenge China's ability to grow and to develop technology. And so I think it's going to have some far-reaching implications. Well, very finally, we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for Economics this week. Tell us about which...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3315,2022-10-15 21:54:21
15030," for reaching implications. Very finally we did have the announcement of three of your fellow economists receiving jointly Nobel Prize for economics this week. Tell us about what you took away from that award. Look, I think it was the analytical recognition of something that practical people had known for a long time, which is that banks and finance are different, that they're subject to confidence crises that are kind of apart from the fundamentals of what's going on, and that you got to be very mindful in public policy to maintain confidence in financial intermediation in a way that's a bit different than you have to with respect to manufacturing companies or airlines or something else. It was very fundamental research, theoretical research in the case of Diamond and Deb Vig using mathematics, careful historical study in the case of Bernanke that I think served him very well during his time at the Fed. Okay, thank you so much to Larry Summers. Our very special contributor here at Wall Street Week. Coming up, you can't always get what you want, no matter how much you're willing to pay for it. That's next on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg. This is Bloomberg Daybreak, but let's welcome to Deb Rack Australia. When US jobs numbers are released, Bloomberg brings you crucial data at terminal speed and instant expert analysis. Nobody covers jobs day like Bloomberg. The pressure cooker just got far too hot in Birmingham for the government to handle. You foresee two-thirds of the crypto hedge funds will disappear. Are we close? The European Union will support and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity. With unmatched reach in resources from more than 120 countries, the moment news breaks 24 hours a day, Bloomberg, your global business authority. Finally, one more thought. When money is no object, watch out. They say the one with the most toys wins, and let's face it, toys usually cost money. And the bigger the toy, the more money it costs. Take, for example, Jeff Bezos knew yet the largest sailing yacht in the world at 417 feet and costing upwards of $500 million. Or Elon Musk agreeing to plunk down $44 billion for the prize of owning Twitter. Something most people think is worth less than the price tag. That is if he ends up paying it. There's two options here. One, the deal falls apart and the stock that has been artificially inflated is going to crash. Or if things go the way Twitter wants, then they get the guy in charge who for the last three months has been saying that Twitter has been lying about its user base.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3316,2022-10-15 21:58:14
15031," more than Donald Trump's $960 million and coming up short. This is not exactly the speech at the Capitol. I hoped to be giving after the election. More poor Columbia pictures, which in 1987 decided to make Ishtar, figuring anything with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty just couldn't fail. But for some reason, a movie about two lounge singers involved in a coup in the made up country of Ishtar didn't quite land with the audiences. Columbia lost around $40 million on the deal, almost $100 million adjusted for inflation today, and the dud established Ishtar as the synonym for box office flop. This is the way system works. Does this look like an oasis to you? Yeah, look at the birds. Are those vultures? And now we can add Steve Cohen to the list of those who went big and lost. The hugely successful hedge fund manager paid around $2.5 billion to buy the New York Max. And this year took it to number one, at least in player salaries. But sad to say for fans of the Amazons, number one in payroll doesn't mean number one on the diamond. The team lost the third game of the wildcard playoff by a score of six to nothing. It was executing pitches and the wheels fell off. I don't know why. We just couldn't figure out a way to get some runs, some off this going. And leaving Mr. Cohen to spend the winter going back to first base. And thinking hard about whether that $278 million in player salaries just maybe wasn't enough. They're going to get to this great point and have all this momentum behind them and then they blow it. That's the match. That's metzing. That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. This is Bloomberg. See you next week. no This is the market that Europe's We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What the order is going to look like, how much work on it pays them, and how much consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or whether they refuse it. And that's the kind of flexibility that our shoppers really value and the kind of transparency that they want. Are you seeing a labor shortage right now? And what are you doing to combat that? It's different in different places or demographic of shoppers. It's completely different from food delivery and our right sharing where 70% women and half of them are moms. And that's because a lot of the job at Instacart is very different than just being in a car with strangers. It's about like going to the store, doing a good job of customer service of really picking the right products for the consumer. And we are seeing that being very appealing to women.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3317,2022-10-15 22:04:09
15032," Welcome to the Earthshot Prize Innovation Summit. I'm Francing Lacqua here at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. This event powered by Bloomberg featured finalists selected by the Earthshot Council, launched by Prince William, is a global initiative that drives innovation on solutions to climate change and environmental issues in the following categories. Protect and restore nature. Clean our air, revive our oceans, build our waste free world, fix our climate. So over the next half an hour we'll bring you all the highlights from this most important gathering. This is Bloomberg. Protecting the environment was of course close to my grandmother's heart. And I know she would have been delighted to hear about this event and the support you're all giving to our Earthshot finalists. The next generation of environmental pioneers. Together in this room are the people and organisations who will help us to achieve the Earthshot mission, to repair, restore and rejuvenate our planet within this current decade. That mission is not simple. Just as President John F. Kennedy so famously said, as he challenged the United States for America to unite behind the goal of putting man on the moon, we choose to do these things not because they are easy but because they are hard. I know that the world is an uncertain place right now, that many families and communities across the globe are facing unimaginable challenges, from conflicts to energy crisis and food shortages. While addressing these in the short term, we must also remain resolutely focused on tackling the greatest challenges that threaten our tomorrow. Because if we don't, the changing climate will only serve to entrench these immediate challenges into fundamental global issues, severely impacting the lives of each and every one of us. That is why our collective mission is so urgent. But there is huge reason to be optimistic. The 2021 cohort of Earthshot winners and finalists is evidence that we can succeed. That we can protect our world for our children, our grandchildren and the generations that will follow them. These pioneers exemplify the leadership needed in this decade of change. They include inspiring activists, brilliant innovators, a forward-thinking city and even an entire country making a real difference. But they cannot do it alone. This must be a team effort. We must come together behind their innovative solutions to ensure they reach their full potential with pace and scale. While my message today is one of gratitude and encouragement, I also acknowledge that you cannot succeed in isolation. As governments, we have a responsibility to create the incentives and the space for you to flourish, a receptive environment for change and the accountability that comes with guardianship. In many nations, the foundation for this approach has been flayed for us long ago if we choose to listen. Where I come from, I will tell you in a beautiful place you must visit. Our indigenous people hold the world view that every single living and non-living thing is connected. Our people, our plants, our animals, descendants of Ranganoi, the sky father and Papa Tuanuku, the earth mother and their children. And so it follows that people and nature are kin, are family. And we must care for one another in the spirit of Katiaki Tanga, which translates into guardianship by the people of the land for the next generation. In short, koha ho te taiau koha ho, I am the environment and the environment is me. Our life source, our economy, our future. Now, I have seen this in action first hand many times, not least in my own backyard, the Pacific, where the ocean is a source of protein, income, culture and connection. Now that is a source of challenge as it rises up and begins to inundate small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, none of us are here because we...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3318,2022-10-15 22:07:21
15033," Small island nations. It can be confronting to hear and see the stories of just how real these challenges are, but none of us are here because we have given up, but because we believe there is a way to change the future. We are not only part of the nature, but we are nature. Nature is living element. For indigenous people, nature is whole. Our planet is a life. The rivers are her blood. The trees are her hair. The soil, her skin, the wind, her breeze. And indigenous peoples, our planet they know, they are the doctor. We are protecting 80% of the world's biodiversity. Because our way of life do not harm nature at the opposite. We are strengthening ecosystems. We improve biodiversity by cooperating with the birds and trees, listening to the winds, observing the cloud, learning from even the little insect. We protect nature by setting up our own limits. We don't take more that mother earth can give and we give back. We protect the sacred trees. We don't destroy the field of the medicinal plants. We choose, pre-susely, the animal that we can kill to just keep the balance of the ecosystem. As all of us know in this fight, no one can afford to sit on the sidelines. No one can claim that climate change is somebody else's problem or to get off for future generations to address. We are all affected by a warming planet. We see that every day. And decisions being made right now will determine our shared tomorrow. So we must choose and we must act as united nations ourselves. Our progress depends on collective action, on collective ingenuity. If we stick together, we can make fixing the climate the greatest project and greatest achievement of our lifetimes. We have the science, we have the solutions. Now all the world needs is political will. Together we can create a future where rampant carbon is removed from the atmosphere, where green buildings and green business transform the levability of communities, where easy access to renewable energy enables greater equity, where sustainable agriculture feeds a growing global population. The needs are urgent and the costs of inaction are worse than any nightmare. But let us not be driven by, let us be driven by hope not fear, by optimism not despair, because hope is not passive. Hope is the ultimate source of renewable energy, pushing us forward every day to try and try again. Today, the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, in partnership with Mike Bloomberg and Bloomberg Philanthropies, will ask each and every one of us what we can do to accelerate progress to repair our planet this decade. And offer solutions on how to collaborate to drive this ambitious but essential climate agenda. We will continue to drive impact around system changing climate solutions and amplify the Earth Shop Prize's call to accelerate progress to repair our planet through collaboration and innovation. But most importantly, we will remind ourselves what can be achieved when we turn pessimism to optimism and optimism into action. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit, this is Bloomberg. Back in 1997, I was interested in the following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called Saurapod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So, a Pada Sauras, is it?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3319,2022-10-15 22:11:35
15034," following question, which is there are a bunch of the dinosaurs called sauropod dinosaurs, which had really long skinny necks. So a podosaurus is an example. That was a really long skinny tail. So I made a computer model that showed that in fact the tail of these sauropod dinosaurs could actually act like a whip, a bullfip. Now the way a bullfip makes that cracking noise is because the tip of the whip actually goes about twice the speed of sound. And that crack is a sonic boom. I think the way they got a date was to impress the females by making loud booms. The markets come down in Europe from the financial centers of the world. Bloomberg markets European polls with Guy Johnson and London and Alex Deel in New York real time numbers real time analysis weekdays. Welcome back to the best of the earth's shop prize innovation summit. The guests featured ranged from heads of state to leaders of grassroots environmental organizations. Well amongst them was philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Yeah it's too bad you can't do things overnight in either mitigation adaptation. You know when I last went through Europe people were the leaders were all saying hey give me technologies so I can tell Putin to get lost. And I said hey in five years you're gonna be able to call him up. They were like no we'd like it now. Okay that how's your planning permission regime and all that you know planning for that that future grid seeds typically between the timing start and they get out in the farmers fields is about eight years. Now we have a pipeline of innovations. You know we've been funding the CG system for 20 years now. It's funded about a billion year. It's if people care at all about adaptation that thing will be funded at two billion a year. I mean there won't be anything close to the impact of climate related seeds climate related maze rice wheat sort of millet and thank goodness because of human genetics we know how to do the editing thank goodness because of AI we know how to find the alleles because of drones we can measure stuff in the field so there's huge advance in terms of how the whole seed ecosystem moves at at full speed. The timing is very tricky here the warming doesn't stop the day you get to zero emissions there's a leg in this system it's about a 20-year leg so you haven't seen that Earth temperatures not equilibrated to the atmospheric CO2 content so when you get to zero that's not it's not like 2051 take my air conditioner away no it starts quite a bit later and so you have to look at what the peak is and you can't just plan for okay 2030 2030's where your main production in central Africa is down 25% by 2050 it's down 70% and you will have switched in most of those areas from a fairly heat sensitive crop to sorghum now sorghum productivity is super low so we'll get people to do better maze for these next 15 years and then they are going to have to switch to sorghum it is tough when you see",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3320,2022-10-15 22:15:43
15035," will get people to do better maize for these next 15 years, and then they are going to have to switch to Sorghum. It is tough when you see the floods impact us down. I mean, nobody expected that. If the goal of climate was to make us pay attention, wow, that is way beyond expectation. So some adaptation money literally will just be disafferable recovery money. The boundary of what's also pretty confusing. I mean, what is food aid? If climate is causing some food production losses, all world-proof program money. Is that all climate adaptation money? It's certainly the need for it's going out. That's a system that's about 6 1.5 billion a year. So relative to the systemic solution, which is the research piece, it's relatively larger, but the demand for that piece, which is the acute half-a-packed Pakistani rice got flushed away. And so you're going to have malnutrition problems if you don't go in for that. That's also a type of adaptation. And so I do think we're going to bring some rigor to this because the pressure now, the goal of doubling the adaptation money from, they say, 20 billion here to 40 billion here. The pressure on that is the program. It's still peanuts. No, it's very small. I mean, literally, yeah, if you start sticking food aid in there, you can use it up very quickly, rebuilding after hurricanes. I mean, we had hurricanes before, but the costs there are absolutely gigantic. There are ways of stopping wildfires that are ways of dealing with sea level rise. So the innovation agenda, not just on seeds, the innovation agenda is going full speed on mitigation. That's where there's 100 companies break through energy's funded. And by mitigation, you mean mostly energy. You mean everything to do with energy. You mean generation of energy. You mean batteries. You mean transport. You mean all of the new. And there are some renewables that are already traditional, but more that need to come on. So that's the package that you're talking about mitigation. Yeah. Or are you also talking about agriculture as mitigation? Yeah. So every area of emissions, the world tends to focus on passenger cars and electricity. That's not a third of emissions. And so the focus on the easiest third, now 4% of new cars are electric. So that's the field that we're furthest along. About 4% of energy generation is wind and solar. And as you triple the size of your grid, you want that to be say, some people would say 100%. Other people might say 70 to 80%. The amount you have to build, we're not within a factor of 5 of the build rate of those. But those are the easy sectors. Cement, clean cement costs over twice as much as the way we make cement today. And it's not, it's partly the heating energy. It's partly the basic thing, remember in chemistry, when you take calcium carbonate and heat it, you get calcium. That's what makes cement. But the thing that goes away, that's CO2. And so we have to have a way of making cement, which a number of these innovative. And steel and iron. Yep. There's a whole family of hard to obeyed sectors. That's true. If you get a bed industrial sector, if you get green hydrogen that's cheap enough, it actually solves quite a large number of those. Some of the industrial processes you go straight to electricity. And some you go through, you do your reduction using the hydrogen, where you would have used some hydrocarbon concept before. For steel, we actually have companies doing both. We have electric steel and others doing electricity is the way of replacing the blast furnace. And then we have others that take hydrogen. And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more. What's called green green.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3321,2022-10-15 22:21:32
15036," And if you get the hydrogen cheap enough, you get the super magic thing, which is that the green product doesn't cost more, that's called green premium equals zero. And then your adoption scale is utterly different. If we try to subsidize steel and cement, say rich countries say, okay, we want to get rid of that, which those two are 15% of emissions, that's greater than all foreign aid budgets put together. And so over 200 billion foreign aid never will pass that number. It's just not politically possible. It's a number that's at about 170 and going down today. Coming up, but more from the panelists and finalists here at the earth's shop prize innovation side. This is Blue Bright. Big expensive cities have a lot going for them. But if you live in one, you probably notice that these big expensive cities keep getting more well expensive. You could always move away. You might have just started working remotely, so there's really nothing keeping you there. But then again, moving is a hassle. Well, what if someone paid you 10 grand to do it? What if they threw in free office space, a bicycle, or a gym membership? Programs and cities and states around the US are doing exactly that, and they're getting a lot of interest. We had over 50,000 applications. About 90,000 applications. We had over 1800 applicants from all over North America. So are these nascent programs actually beneficial to their communities and the workers joining them? Are they little more than flashy advertising campaigns for places looking for an injection of fresh talent? Markets are preparing to close, but the day is not over yet. It's talked that it's now up about 45%. A lot of volatility, right? You need the power of the Bloomberg terminal to get you market moving data before anyone else. There's numbers much higher than they expect. You need top analysts to bring you exclusive global insight into cross-asset markets. The mini-bond market is a really big focus. Bitcoin ain't running along today. It's going to be a short term. Bloomberg markets the close weekdays on Bloomberg. Welcome back to the Earth Shop Prize Innovation Summit. Finalists of the annual award appeared alongside special guests, including worldwide business leaders, philanthropists and non-governmental activists. Now while the 2022 finalists have been announced, our panelists have their eyes on the future and hear what they have to say. This is the Earth Shop Decade. We are in a race to repair and regenerate the planet. Some will focus on policy. Some will focus on activism. We are focused on supporting the game changes, the innovators, the entrepreneurs and the problem solvers. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, grit and determination to create solutions that if scaled could repair the planet. We have only 8% of the ocean protected today. Our Earth Shop is, as Paddy said, 30 by 30. 30% of the ocean at least. We know that if we protect the right 30%, not only will we prevent the extinction of many marine species, but also we will produce more fish. There will be this protected area, as we will produce a spillover that will exceed the forgorn catch. We will have more fish to eat, food security, livelihoods for people. And we know that for every dollar that we invest in a protected area in a marine reserve, that produces 10 dollars in economic output and creates more jobs. So it's a triple win for marine life, for food security and for climate and of course for the economy. So that's the goal, the mission to in the next 8 years, and that's where the Earth Shop is pretty crazy. And next 8 years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protected.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3322,2022-10-15 22:24:47
15037," That's where the air shot is pretty crazy. In the next eight years, we need to quadruple all the ocean protection that has ever happened in human history. Are you optimistic that I can be done? I am optimistic there's no choice. I've seen firsthand the potential that a breakthrough idea can hold. And if we start seeing more of these transformative solutions across all the challenges facing our planet and suddenly our earth shot won't seem so improbable. The work will be difficult. It'll take extraordinary resources, determination, partnership. But we've got all the essentials right here in this room. So what is the challenge? It's the speed, scale, and cost of making these green hydrogen generators. Well, that's exactly what we are working on. Because to make green hydrogen the fuel source of the future, it needs to be cheaper than fossil fuels. And that means, electrolyzers are going to need to be really, really cheap. If you want to take a solution around the globe as quickly as possible, you need to make it standardized, mass-produced commodity. A product that is easy to make and quick to build and cheap as well. And so while some believe electrolyzers need to be large machines, we believe the electrolyzer should be a standardized, mass-producible product that can make green hydrogen anywhere for anyone. In 2030, we imagine millions and millions of projects on restore and not just places on earth where we see nature being brought back, but all of the other nodes that are key to ensuring success. So the technology providers, the nurseries, the seed banks, the funders, the government incentive programs, so that we have an ecosystem that really allows us to leverage the many, many connections within the nature-based solution space. And in 2030, we have been focused on another key area which is cities and cities require data and insights to take action on climate and to preserve nature, to create more nature and tree canopy. So we've set a goal that we want to- We want more in cities, exactly, exactly, right? And so we've been partnering with cities like Los Angeles to give them insights utilizing AI and geo mapping on where all the places that you can create more tree canopy which reduces urban heat islands, improves air quality sequesters carbon. So we want to bring data and solutions to bringing nature into cities as well as, of course, preserving and restoring nature. And so one of the goals that we've set is that we want to enable over 500 cities around the world, and we're going to hear from the mayor of Paris after this to reduce a gigaton of carbon emissions by 2030. And so that's through data, tools, insights, whether that's evolving transportation systems or planting new tree canopy. So that's a big bold target that we want to see achieve by 2030. Anyway, I guess I'm in the wrong place. I came here to invite all of you to the Grouch Convention. But it turns out you're all about my least favorite thing, helping. Oh. You've got me, Oscar. I do like helping people learn how to reuse repurpose and recycle. Together, everyone in this room can build a world where nothing goes to waste. And that includes even you. Me? Sorry, Mike. I got to get going to that convention. But just between us, I do have a recycling bin right next to my can. But don't let that get out OK. It'll ruin my image. But my father believed in the power of the idea. And over time, the vision, the purpose, the courage, it embodied has inspired each generation to take on its own challenges, not because they're easy, but because they're hard. President Kennedy understood that the effort to land on the moon would bring out the best in us that everyone would have to contribute, that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith.

15038," One would have to contribute that it would require innovation, creativity, teamwork, commitment, and faith, and that we're all to be better because of it. The Earth Shot Prize has inspired the same spirit of optimism and ingenuity on a global scale to tackle the most pressing challenge we now face, repairing the planet. My family and I are so excited that the Prince of Wales will honor this year's Earth Shot Prize winners in partnership with the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, a city that is committed to scientific excellence, environmental justice, and the fight against climate change. We're proud that President Kennedy's moonshot legacy still inspires hope and we look forward to welcoming all of you who are working to ensure a better future here on Earth. And that's all from the Earth Shot Prize Innovation Summit. You can find complete coverage of the event including full interviews and articles on bloomberg.com. I'm FrancingLakwa from New York and this is Bloomberg. What do Formula One cars and your local supermarket have in common? Well, strange as it sounds, they might both be using the same technology. A lot of innovation has trickle down from the world of high tech engines and it hasn't just found a new life in road cars. F1 cars have long been thought of as the peak of cool and technology in them is also helping to pull down our produce aisles. Engineers from Williams are using their knowledge from nine constructors championships working with company Aerofoil to help reduce the energy consumption of supermarkets. The device they're building is based on the design of an F1 cars rear wing. It attaches to fridges to keep more cool air in the unit. They estimate it can reduce supermarket energy consumption by 25%. One innovation from F1 is also helping hybrids reduce their carbon footprint. That's curves or the kinetic energy recovery system. In common parlance, it's known as regenerative braking and works by storing energy of the car decelerating in a battery for later use. If that's not enough, F1 is now looking at hers or a thermal energy recovery system looking to harness the heat produced from braking and the engine exhaust that could allow cars to generate the same power using 30% less fuel. So while F1 may have a reputation as a gas-duzzler, some of its innovations in the name of speed are helping in the everyday fight against climate change.

Thank you for having me. What drives you? What drives me? Oh my god. I love the idea of a simple as this uninclusive world. I want to have people see them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3324,2022-10-15 22:33:18
15039," drives me. Oh my God, I love, you know, the idea of just a simple as this uninclusive world, a world where people see themselves reflected because I was supposed to be invisible by our accounts. I was supposed to not be where I am. I was supposed to have disappeared a long time ago and every turn in my life was about visibility. Yes, I will be this person who's not supposed to be here. Yes, I will fight through the hard times. Yes, I won't give up. And even though I was sort of the token black editor in the industry in the 90s, I knew even then that I needed to bring people up with me. I needed to bring other people up with me. And so that's really been a part of, you know, maybe it's maybe it was growing up in a family of six. I don't know. When you run a team, how do you instill that work ethic that kind of answering emails at all time? Yeah, I mean, you know, I think you say an example, you know, if you're an editor who leaves and has lunches and it's never in the office, you know, you don't really sort of instill faith. My team know that, you know, we're on a mission. We have to reflect the world we live in. We have to you know, reflect the, you know, the beauty of multiculturalism. We have to reflect, you know, the beauty and diversity and inclusivity. So everybody takes it really seriously and we really have intense conversations about the side guys and the world. And so, you know, I'm very lucky to have a team who are as passionate and you know, I could call my team, you know, I could call somebody at six a more, they can call me at six a.m. and I'll pick up and they'll pick up. So, you know, we have something very special that we've built over the past sort of five years. But there were difficult moments, right? I think the first time one of your first issues, you thought that you could have been fired for it. I'll just ask that, right? I mean, I lived in America, I lived in America for a bit and I was working for W magazine and and there was talk of Brexit and of course Americans were like your country's really, you know, xenophobic. So, you know, I came back and I thought, you know, I'm going to be welcome with open arms and they're going to love me and oh my god, literally back to them by fire. But I remember thinking, you know, I wanted to create a magazine where every woman could see themselves, you know, where every woman regardless of the backgrounds, regardless of their age could just literally see themselves. And at the time, now it looks like it's the norm when you look at other magazines, but in 2017, that was that was a radical idea. But I also remember thinking, you know, with my background, you know, I've lost so much and gained so much that I thought, if I'd knew, if I'm fired, I'd rather be fired for what I believed in. I'd rather be fired for creating a magazine that reflected the world as it was and try to sort of create a second-rate version of someone's vision. And that continues. I mean, there's this idea of always pushing forward. Yeah. Right. What's the end? How do you measure success? How do I measure success? I'm definitely not not financial. I mean, I think it's more about for me, when I'm really exhausted, when I'm really tired, when I'm really questioning if I can go on, you know, I walk on the street and I see a little girl, a little black girl who's who's seen the magazine and it's the norm for them all. A curvy woman on a traitor palace who's like, thank you for, you know, seeing me, you know, that makes it worth what that for me is success. And then anybody who knows or have known me for a while will witness that that for me is success. You know, my jaw is done when that happens. Do you think, I mean, do people come up to you? They do, but it's always, it's always in a positive way. It's always thank you for seeing us, you know, but I can relate because, like, as I said, you know, by all accounts, I was meant to be invisible, you know. So for me, shining in light on people and making them seen, it's natural for me. They say that the fashion industry is changing. You're changing it. Are others around you changing it? I mean, now, you know, you look at other magazines and seeing real women in there, it's no longer a radical act, seeing, you know, people of color, women of color on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's being normal, you know, it's been normalized. Then for me.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3325,2022-10-15 22:38:14
15040," Radical act, see, you know, people of colour, women of colour on covers is no longer a radical act. So it's been normalised, and for me I'm quite happy when I see that. When you put Dame Judy Dengue on the cover, and she's 85 years old, and the world just laughed it. Nobody questioned her, you know, should she be on the cover or you put a girl with a hijab on the cover. And it's not a problem, that for me shows that, you know, we're advancing, we're progressing. So, you know, progress for me is very important. Which is important, and so how do you take care of your team? How do you build a team around you? My team, I mean, somebody said to me once, when you build a team, make sure you employ people, you like. People, when you see them working towards your office, you're just so excited to see. That was it. Being good at your job, and sort of a connection, and being excited to see, you know, team members, because you only have to do it as your team. You know, no man is an island. You know, I don't create the magazine on my own. And so it's great to have a team who, you respect, and who's views you respect. You know, and who respects you. How do you think you're seen by your team? Do you have to be fearful? Do you have to be authoritarian? I'm a worker, I work very hard. But I think I'm pretty open. You can have conversations with me. You know, ultimately the final decision rests with me, but I do listen. I like conversation, I like interaction. So that's, I mean, that's how I hope they think I'm a good boss, and that's, you know, really all you can hope for. Because, you know, they work on a very good magazine. They can get other jobs anywhere. So the fact that they're there makes me think that they must be happy. Edward, how do you see the publishing world changing? So people buy less magazines. You've been, I mean, you've been doing pretty well in terms of selling more. But in five years, how does it look? I mean, I was like, you know, five years ago, I, you know, I mean, let's go back to ID when I was 18, you know, I inherited a magazine, you know, which will come out. We're sort of about club kids and you have to be out there. And the only way you can see street fashion was through ID. And then 2017, I inherited, you know, I inherited a magazine. But now I oversee a brand, you know, the magazine is sort of the highest or the high, the best paper, you know, the best photographers, the best, you know, cultural messages. But at the moment, you know, when you manage a brand, it's not just about that. It's about digital. It's about video. It's about audio. It's about events. So for somebody who's so forward looking, it's so great for me. And people always ask, oh, it's a magazine instead. When we launch a cover, Instagram is our cover essentially. So I've, you know, found a way, we found a way of sort of making it work hand in hand. And it's so great for me, you know, I think how do I just been doing the magazine? I probably would have been bored. So magazines aren't dead? Are they gonna, you know, I mean, yeah, but they're gonna work in hand with digital platforms, you know. But also, I'll tell you something, new readers of old, young readers don't necessarily come to us through the new stands. They come through that, you know, digital platforms or, you know, audio videos we put out. So, yes, now it's increased tenfold. So, yeah. Well, do you think that will change the kind of readership that you will court, the either age of your readers, but also where they come from? Yes, I mean, at the moment, you know, I think the readership is getting younger because of, you know, the whole digital landscape. And I hope that, you know, as we move forward, it kind of, yeah, we have new readers and we also keep our loyal readers, you know. Edward, do you think there's ever a time where actually we won't have print magazines anymore? No, I think print will always exist, sort of a long-side digital, but it'll probably be something more precious, sort of better paper, something more collectible that you want to keep in your house, almost like artwork. So, no, I don't think print is going to die. So, fewer copies. See a copy, but more quality. But more quality. More quality. You know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. I know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3326,2022-10-15 22:42:38
15041," Better quality, you know, almost like a book. The table book. I love that. I know. Need to. I think it's crucially important. And I think we've moved from this attitude, from its indulgence, a waste of time, almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s, and so it makes that a really exciting field, because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize, and that makes you smart. If you can spit back a lot of facts. But if you want to be wise, you really want to listen, you got to know when and how and why to use that information. And that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. Access the financial world on demand. Be alive and on demand webinars, only from Bloomberg. Visit Bloomberg.com webinars. You're recently on TikTok. Yes. Is that fun? I'm so much fun. I literally have to be held back. But the brilliant thing is, I'm so curious. I mean, I like all the digital platforms. I really like to keep my finger on the poles. I'm one of the people that leaves work and shuts themselves. I really want to be out there seeing the world as they're all as beauty. So I'm very curious. I have a very curious mind. I'm glad. I'm glad. It keeps everything moving and exciting. Is that for Gen Z? Is that a commercial purpose to get closer to that? No, it's just out of curiosity. I've always been like that. I've always wanted to know what's next. I didn't want to be the one that's just being told, oh, you're 50. Or whatever. I pay attention to everything. But there was such a beautiful place for me. And it goes back to my childhood again. Well, the biggest challenge to grow the brand in the next five years. Because we still keep it relevant. We have such great digital traffic. Almost 6 million every month to British vote. But I'm really excited about overseeing the European votes as well, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France, and sort of mentoring a whole new generation of editors. You know, when there was this whole agonization, the whole world thought there was a global view that was going to dominate. But it's very much about local conversations as well as global conversations. So I learn from these content leads. And I hope that they also learn. So the local global conversation I'm very excited about moving into the future. Do you think it changes if we're in a recessionary environment? So you have such a glamorous lifestyle. Or what you sell is so glamorous. Is it impacted by the cost of living or inflation of what we can live through? I mean, you know, I remember a few years ago I put Taylor Swift on the cover and the violin was by better, by less, and it was a radical concept at the time. And now we all talk about sustainability.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3327,2022-10-15 22:46:20
15042," Taylor Swift on the cover and the by-line was by better, by less. And it was a radical concept at the time. But now we all talk about sustainability. We know we can't keep shopping every day. We know we have to buy things that last, things that help the planet, things that we can pass on to sort of other generations. So I think that really is a conversation on the fashion industry is having right now that I find so exciting. And it's good to be sort of, you know, people are going to have less money so they have to buy things that last. And I'm really excited. And these are real changes. It's not just real changes. Real changes. It's not just conversation. It's actually happening. Do you think fashion brands always need to have a political point of view when they're great injustices? I think fashion brands can do more. I feel that having a black model in your show or having a feed on your Instagram post, it's not enough. We need diverse voices behind the scenes. I always say that I talk to sort of all the CEOs. I know we need to employ more people from diverse backgrounds because that's the only way you can even reach out to more people. A variety of voices is always better than just one. And I always also say, let's not just have interns, let's have people on all different levels. And that's what I keep talking to people about. Do they listen? Some listen. But I think since George Floyd was married, more and more companies sort of made pledges to people of color. And it's a slow process. Some have taken it seriously and some are still working their way through it. But we have to keep on. The problem is that you can make a pledge and then follow through. So you have to really focus and keep asking that question for people to follow through. And so do you feel like you're a guardian of that, of making sure that when you get promised something, they'll do it. And you'll hold them into account. I mean, yes, if they promise something, that I asked for, then I would literally wear you down. I would literally chase you until you keep your promise, not just who I am. We actually have one of the diverse cabinets here in the UK with Liz Truss. Is that important to you? It is so important as somebody who came from another country and was sort of welcomed by the UK. It's very important to have a diverse cabinet. That's how change happens. Going back to what we discussed before, that's how you understand people who are on the periphery or who've been avid. It's so important to have a diverse cabinet. But this you think in terms of policies and what they can bring to the table or just also seeing an idea of a diverse cabinet. I hope they can have an effect on policy. I hope they can have an effect on the parties themselves as well as policy. For me, it's about policy that makes people's lives better. I know you're also very close to Ghana still. I mean, there's a pretty scandalous anti-LGBT bill getting through. I mean, it's so funny. I was invited back to Ghana a few years ago by the President. It was the year of the return. And I remember the last time we were in Ghana, we were fleeing. And I really supported the changes. I love the changes that we're going through. But yes, they do have an LGBT problem. Some friends and I signed a whole. I don't know if you saw it. And we're doing what we can to change things on the ground. I think you can't also sit in the West and tell a country what to do. So it's about sort of forming alliances on the ground and seeing what is needed and how we can help. Whether than standing on our soap boxes, going, do this, do that, do this. So that's through what grounds, I mean, ground work trying to change from with it. Yes, from with it. Yeah. Trying to change from with it, you know, talking to heads of LGBTQ members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3328,2022-10-15 22:51:04
15043," You members and asking them what they need and what we can do to help. Rather than you know, I say do this, this is how you do it because we don't live that. You have a memoir out. Yeah. Why put it down on paper? You know something about when you turn 50. You know something about when it's your fifth year of vote. You know, I got married this year. You know, I'm normally not someone who looks back all the time, but it felt like the right time for me to do that. And also, you know, I just felt that a lot of young people sort of see people like you and I and they think, you know, we just got here and we were always here and for me was really important to share the story of a journey about, you know, successors and, you know, failures. And, you know, that's the reason why I got here. I wanted to share that story with them sort of young people, as well as people who, you know, feel like they're on the outskirts of, you know, the outside of the industry really. Do you feel like an outsider? I think I always feel like an outsider, but as I said before, you know, I grew up African in an African household in England, you know, different languages, different foods. I go to school and I've been in England. So I've always been about duality. I've always seen myself as an outsider, but also an insider. And even when, you know, I took the job at British folk, I was the black gay working class outsider, but, you know, I've been in the industry since I was 18. I was, in essence, an insider. So that's really, it's the other duality that plays out in my life. What, who do you think made you the person you are today? I know you left home twice, right, Ghana, but also you had to leave your home. Yes. I mean, the puzzle made me who I mean really is my mother. I mean, I mean, I loved my mother. She taught me about sort of beauty. She taught me about clothes, you know, about fascist. She taught me that beauty came in all forms, that, you know, women were beautiful, no matter what shape there were, no matter what color, what religion. And so that really stayed with me. And I guess my creativity comes from her. And of course, I also had a military father. So the idea of precision and organization and sort of thinking ahead also comes from him. How did your father, I know you had a difficult relation with your father. How did your father shape the person you are today? It's a funny, I should ask this question because I never thought I was like my father growing up. You know, I was very shy, very sensitive, you know, a little, a little spacey. I prefer the company of women. To men, my dad was sort of, you know, a sort of, that sort of a theory and disciplinarian. You know, you had to, you know, be home at certain time. He roamed as an iron fist. And I thought, you know, I'm never going to be like him. You know, he kicked me out of the house, you know, when I was 18. But I found out that over the years, when it comes to work and discipline and sort of organization, that is him to a T. You will put a woman on Mars. You will bring forth global cooling.

15044," you So at some point you lose your eyesight. What was that like? Yeah, basically I have sort of very high myopia. So I've never had great eyesight and I went through a series of sort of reponal detachments for to be exact and with each detachment I would sort of have to end up looking down in a contraption for about three weeks and in the dark room and it was very harrowing, it was very harrowing time in my life but I always say you know you don't have to have vision to have vision. So in those dark rooms my imagination was even bigger. You know I dream bigger and I came out of sort of the last surgery and the cover I did was for W. Magazine with Rihanna, with Queen, with a golden eye and I look back at it and I thought oh my God there are the eyes, some limit, some limitily so yes it was very challenging and it gave me to this day you know I go for checkups to make sure my eyes are okay and they're great right now and you know once the more I look after myself the better the better. But it's amazing you power through adversity. Do you ever think actually this is too much? Have you ever thought this is too much? I mean there have been times when I felt this is too much but it's not in my vocabulary to start. It's not in my DNA to start you know I am my mother's son, my father's son you know the edge to move forward it's always there and that's why you know when I was young I would always get up and work I had a responsibility touch when I still got on a plane to go shoot the Hollywood put folio but now I'm learning to say no now I'm learning I can't do that job I can't fly no it takes time but it comes with age. It takes courage to say no right? Definitely. So when you look at all your covers and there's so many beautiful ones is there one that's that's special to you? Well I say to someone they're like my children. I always have a favorite child but I'm especially proud of the covers we did in lockdown you know when the world had essentially shut down you know the teams were sort of scattered all around London and I had to go back to the days of idea when you know you had to really create user imagination and we had a series of four covers Judy Densch when they said you know anybody over 60 she stayed at home the essential workers cover a cover of landscapes just so people could take a breather and the activists cover when George Floyd was murdered and I really think we create covers that you know in years time people can look back and see what the time that period was like for me an artist always has to reflect the times to paraphrase Nina Simone and that's really important for me. I mean there was a bit of controversy with Linda van Gillespie. Yes I mean you know there was a there was a complaint that oh you know she should she should have looked a certain way you know and for me I've no Linda in the 90s I've known this incredible icon who really defined what a model should be and I also saw my friend go through really dark days you know due to the complications for surgery literally disappear from the world really not the Linda the world news so when we were doing this cover it was the collaboration she wanted to be that Linda that everybody knew she wanted to feel good about herself again and I wasn't going to deny her that and also you know whatever I would like to stay whatever I would.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3330,2022-10-15 22:59:49
15045," It's to be that Linda that everybody knew. She wanted to feel good about herself again. And I wasn't going to deny her that act. And also, you know, whatever I would like to say, whatever a woman wants to do with her body, it's up to her. So, you know, I'm very proud of Linda and I'm very proud of that cover. And I mean, some of that, you're almost like an activist. Is that how you're like a fashion activist or a political fashion? But I'm definitely a creative, but, you know, I've always believed, you know, look at my life story in my book, you know, I wasn't like, I keep saying I wasn't supposed to be here. You know, had my dad not left, I don't know even what would have happened to my family. So even when we ended up in a room, two rooms in a voxel, six of us, we were so happy to be there, penniless, but so happy to be there. So, you know, every day, I just, you know, I'm an optimist. And I know it's not the most fashionable thing, but that's why I'm sitting here with you today. Bye. Edward, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you. Thank you for the time. Thank you so much for talking to me about the new future, you know, the new work of the industry. Thank you for coming to me. Thank you for coming to me. Thank you for the time. I'm having a good time. I'm really happy to meet you. Thank you very much for this opportunity and for being here. I'm really happy to be here for something which is yours. It's very stressful. I mean, I wish it didn't happen. Everything which happened to me is a lesson in a way, bad or good. Once it's done, it's done and you're sort of happy. I mean, I'm happy about it. That thing I could have definitely be avoided. But it's done. Did you realize at the time when you started the company that you would become so successful and actually so big? You know, when I started the company, I wanted to have a shop in Paris, which is my hometown, and I wanted to do pretty shoes for pretty girls. That was my goal. Now you look back and you say, actually, I still make pretty shoes, but for many more women. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you would've been so successful without the Red Soul? I think the Red Soul definitely, of course, participates to my work, but also to the fame of my shoes because it's instantly recognizable. But then, you know, the design is very important. But definitely, when you have such a strong sign of recognition, it participates to... Yeah. We will never break. Build on a foundation strong enough to stay. We will never break. Have a wide array of things and the mountains shake. All of them will remain. We will never. We will never. No. Before the COVID pandemic upended the way the world does business, logistics was one of those industries that might have been taken for granted. But that's not the case anymore. Due to all the turbulences over the last two years, customers are now realizing how important it is to have a reliable logistics partner on their side. Our people are doing a quite complex job. People think, oh, they just deliver passes somewhere. That's an easy job. If you think about what our people are doing, it's quite complex. Businesses and consumers are suddenly thinking a lot more about how things they need to reach places where they're needed. It's thrust the sector into the spotlight. Logistics and supply chain has become a household need. It's dramatically different than three pandemic. Yes, it's grown whether that's in.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3331,2022-10-15 23:04:26
15046," The justice and supply chain has become a household name. It's dramatically different than pre-pandemic. Yes, it's grown, whether that's in Marfay County, where we need profitability, invest your interest. For Deutsche Post DHL Group, that's created opportunity to build on momentum and set ambitious goals for service and performance. When you look at our footprint, you're the most international logistics company there is. We want to become more digital and we want to be much more sustainable than we have been. DP DHL's revenue has soared since 2020, with full-year profit nearly doubling in 2021. CFO Melanie Christ is a key leader of the team that's delivered these results. And she views her role as much more than just a number-cruncher. There are unfortunately these clichés that finance is boring and it's been counting in the back office to be successful in finance. You have to have the financial expertise. But we also have to be credible business leaders in order to really impact the business and steer the direction. She is extremely smart and bright. You need somebody who is able to digest a lot of information that is rapidly and can distinguish what is important and what is less important. She has tremendous skill in that. And she's not afraid to call people out, to call out other members of the executive team. If she feels that something isn't being. She does that in a very nice way, actually. She helps me tremendously in steering of the company because she is highly regarded by my other colleagues in the senior team. And typically, if they have a problem, they share it first with her before they come to me. When I think about the conversations I have with Frank, the shortest part is actually about the analysis and the facts. It's more the debate about, OK, on that basis, what are the options? What can we do? My role is essentially saying in three sentences, what is working well in this company, where do we have challenges, and what should we do going forward? Do you post DHL Group consists of five divisions, express, Germany's post and parcel service, global forwarding and freight, supply chain and e-commerce solutions. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years. The company has been working on the same thing. The company has been working on the same thing. The company has been working on the same thing. The company has been working on the same thing. The company has been working on the same thing. Each of these segments has seen revenue growth in the last four years. While the surge of e-commerce volume during the pandemic has had a direct impact on the trajectory. Have you seen e-commerce as a very structural and fundamental growth driver for us as a company? What we now saw under the pandemic was a structural acceleration. It took us forward to a point in terms of e-compensation, which we probably would have reached on the normal circumstances in three years' time. So it was a big step forward. DP DHL was well prepared to take this step. The company's strategic plan recognized e-commerce as a growing trend in the logistics landscape. But no one could have forecast the speed and breadth of the transformation. What we are now seeing that also under the pandemic not only domestic e-commerce has taken a faster growth trajectory than anticipated but also cross-border e-commerce. And we see that very clearly in our express network but also in our e-commerce solutions division. What are the other big structural shifts that you see on the horizon? Is it e-commerce B2B? Is it increased trade as globalisation restructures? What are the shifts that you're seeing? The board B2B e-commerce is still at a very early stage. So we believe that there will be a huge close opportunity there. And we also see that when we are talking to our customers now. I guess everybody has been now realised that being dependent on just one supplier in one province in one country is probably not a good idea. So they want to build more resilience into the supply chain. I think our international footprint, our global strengths, is really something we can leverage for the benefit of our customers. Another factor in the company's favour is its balance sheet. Since Melanie Christ became CFO, cash flow has improved significantly. One of my priorities over the last years has been to really focus the whole organisation on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job. Making sure that all the money is being paid.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3332,2022-10-15 23:08:31
15047," The last years has been to really focus the whole organization on better cash generation. It's not just a finance job, making sure that ultimately revenue converts into EBIT and into cash in the bank account is the responsibility of the whole organization. She says, you know, we can't be successful as a company if we are not collecting the cash for our services we have provided. And she has not missed one single opportunity to talk about that. I think it's a very comfortable situation, particularly in the current environment, to have a strong balance sheet. I think in that respect, I'm very conservative and I'd rather have a bit more on the balance sheet and a bit more buffer. Spell out for us what the priorities are, the longer-term priorities in terms of putting some of that cash to use for you. The first priority here is organic growth. We clearly indicated also this our CAPEX budget, 12 billion for the next three years, that we will keep investing into organic growth. We are very focused on our regular dividend payment. And then if there is something left, which is fortunately the case at the moment, we will think about inorganic opportunities and we will also think about other means to allow our shareholders to participate. That is why we are currently running a 2 billion euro share by the program. Inorganic opportunities include M&A, like the recent purchase of beverage shipper, Hila Brand, but deploying cash is always subject to careful consideration. Does Melanie ever turn around and say no when you're pushing through or pushing for a particular package of spending? Yes, she does that quite often, because she has... She is a person and that's great if you have a CEO who is risk of risk because you need somebody. The business is always too optimistic. Melanie might be something too pessimistic, but that's a very healthy discussion. And if we then jointly come to the same conclusion after a debate, then we are probably in the right spot. How often do you find yourself saying no to divisional heads? So when I was promoted into the CFO position, my team gave me a stamp with rejected. It sits on my desk. I think the fact that people know it sits there already has instilled quite a lot of discipline in the organization. So I think when I get a proposal, it has already gone through a number of iterations and is normally of such a high quality that I don't need the rejected stamp too often. For the time being, Christ should be able to keep that stamp in a drawer. CEO Frank Appell has expressed a commitment to service quality and confidence that customers will accept higher prices that come with it. If you are too expensive, you will be out of business, but if you don't provide the right quality, you will be out of business as well. So we want to be, we will never be the cheapest in town. That's not doable. We are the premium provider. That's our strategy. Of course, it's also more challenging for us when our customers are under pressure. At the same time, I think, over all the last two years have shown that a reliable high quality supply chain comes at a certain price tag. I definitely see that inflation is having a huge impact on the logistics industry and there's been substantial price increases in the last few years. I do not see that changing. There's a lot of innovation happening and I don't see the inflation necessarily going away. It might level out a bit, but it's not going to go away. The logistics companies may have pricing power with customers, but their stock prices haven't been so robust. I think the issue there is the increase in interest rates has made everyone rethink and be concerned about the level of inventory that is out in the system, if you will, with the level of disruption. I think what's happened more in the last three months is that more of a few that were actually going into certainly a new coming slowdown may be a recession. With more than half its revenue coming from Europe, investors may see DP DHL as more exposed to recession risks than its global peers. The company insists it can meet its revenue target in the event of a downturn.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3333,2022-10-15 23:12:44
15048," As more exposed to recession risks than its global peers, the company insists it can meet its revenue targets in the event of a downturn. It's counting on diversification as a cushion. I'm not so pessimistic that there is really a deep recession at our doorstep. But even then, our portfolio is very much balanced. We are everywhere in the world, and the world will not go entirely into recession. I doubt that. Would it be a stretch to suggest that D.P. DHL is, to some extent, recession-proof? I wouldn't go as far as to say recession-proof, but I think we are very well positioned to deal with all different types of recessions in recent areas, due to the breadth of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio really gives us a lot of billions against any type of headwind. Coming up, a look at D.P. DHL's investments in action. Melanie Christ shows me around the company's state-of-the-art logistics hub. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025. This is Bloomberg. You will shed light on dark matter. You will make aging optional. You will turn 5G up to 11, because when you subscribe to Bloomberg, you won't just get news. You'll get insight into limitless possibilities, knowledge, and inspiration to feed your ambition. So before you invent pioneer, disrupt, before you change the world, Bloomberg. As the chief financial officer of one of the world's largest logistics companies, I wanted to become a physicist, and that was where my passion was. But then during my studies, some friends of mine started doing this strange thing. They went into management consulting. I didn't even know how to spell it. I had no idea what it was about, but what they told me was quite interesting. So I ended up doing an internship with a consulting firm. I learned more in the two months there than I had in the last two years in my physics job at university. That is how I ended up in consulting. She started her career with three years at McKinsey, then spent four years in private equity with APEX partners in London, before joining Deutsche Post DHL Group in 2004. I was brought into the company to do international M&A project. That was at time around 20 years ago when we were really building the company in the current shape, acquiring lots of logistics companies around the world. The M&A part was the first thing, and I then wandered into a more mainstream finance field here in the group, becoming the CFO of our DHL Express Division. So from then on, it was more leading towards the CFO role eventually. Melanie Christ now heads the finance team with around 11,000 employees. Success in this role is as much an art as a science. If you do the greatest piece of analysis and you see it all and you know it all, but you can't convey that message and you can't convince the rest of the organisation that we should move into a certain direction, it's useless. DHL is sending a consistent message with its investments. The company spent 123 million euros to upgrade its logistic centre at the Clone Bon Airport, designing it around key strategic goals. What I love about this building is it actually shows the big mega trends which formed our strategy 2025, which was inaugurated in 2019 when this building opened. Globalisation connecting the world. E-commerce, we have a lot of sortation facilities here for smaller e-commerce shipments. Sustainability, it's a very sustainable building, there's solar panels on the roof and everything, and digitalisation, and well you can obviously see that it is quite automated. How did the team pitch this investment to you initially? And how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3334,2022-10-15 23:16:56
15049," Team pitch this investment to you initially and how hard was it as a sell for them? How quickly did you turn around and say yes, this is worth 123 million euros. Of course you always have to make sure that you have the right capacity for the growth in the network. And at that time they came and said hey, we will really see a strong growth in e-commerce volumes on top of the regular B2B growth. We need more sorting capacity, we need this building. And of course they are always debates, does it really have to cost 123 million euros and so on. But fortunately they convinced us because then with COVID and the volume search we urgently needed the capacity. At the same time as COVID accelerated demand for logistic services, disruptions in the labour supply hurt productivity. Advances and technology like this digital sauter have helped offset some pressures, but automation also raises questions. Does this tell us that this is the business grows? This is going to become a more automated business that is going to be less need for labour, for workers. Well you still see people here and I think what you can nicely witness here is the combination of technology which supports people. So for example when you look at the customs area, it used to be a very manual and sometimes confusing process. Now the people are supported in picking the right shipments for customs inspections by lights and they are automatically sorted in this sauter to go to customs inspections. So it is also helping the people with the jobs they are doing here every day. We are over set here in 2019-20. You know we might get one third less jobs in the current setup until 2030 if we digitalise the organisation. But we are very sure that our company will be at least 50, maybe 100% bigger and we will have more jobs to offer. At the beginning of a couple of years ago when we started that journey people said, oh you know I might lose my job, I haven't heard that in the last two years as a question any tone hold. This airport hub also showcases DP DHL's aviation fleet which both small than 320 dedicated cargo aircraft. We own the biggest tank of our aircraft but we also have short and medium and long term leases and this grows in our business we anticipate that the fleet will keep going. You've talked about investing of course in sustainable fuel. Yes. When does that come online? How significant is it? Is it just the critics might say that's just window dressing around a part of the business that is of course very carbon intensive? At least a lot of emissions. Yeah so you absolutely write the problem with our beautiful aircraft is the CO2 emissions. And when you look at our overall CO2 emissions two thirds are from aviation. It is about flying these birds with more sustainable fuel and we said that we are really willing to spend billions on it. We now really hope that we will see the uptick and supply over the next years. Spending billions isn't vague hyperbole. The company has pledged to put 7 billion euros towards sustainable technologies and fuels by 2030 with a goal of climate neutral logistics by 2050. Sustainability makes good business sense anyway, especially if you are in a business that is energy or fuel hungry as a compliance element that not just operators in the logistics sector need to consider but also their customers. So being transparent becomes part of the service about their impact on the globe. We had a lengthy discussion should we make a financial commitment how much we want to invest for the next decade in our sustainability? We had a long debate is at right to say we want to invest 7 billion until 2030. There were pros and cons. But that was a very intense discussion melody in IHAT where we finally came to the conclusion that this is a right number. This is a right approach we convinced our colleague and that's the reason why we are where we are. We are seeing somebody who really commit that not that many companies who have quantified their future investment.

15050," Also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. This is Bloomberg. The first element on the periodic table is the most abandoned element in the universe. And when clean energy advocates think about what can we find which would be as easy to use as fossil fuels they think about hydrogen. The fuel that will when burn only produce water. We like to imagine that if we just built enough of these and these we could ditch fossil fuels and save the planet. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. There are some things we just need a good old-fashioned combustible fuel. Now startups around the world are betting that hydrogen can become the fuel of the 21st century. Japan's critical role in the global economy is changing as the world recalibrates.

Corporate giants, policymakers and pioneers tell us how they're doing just that. Every week on Japan ahead, right here on Bloomberg Television. No one covers the world like Bloomberg.

Bloomberg, you are global business authority. Deutsche Post DHL Group's CFO Melanie Christ is often named to lists of the most powerful women in business. And while men still outnumber women as finance heads of large companies, there are signs that the balance is shifting. The number of female CFOs across major US companies has risen to an all-time high, according to a study by Chris Kolder Associates. An executive search firm Cohen Partners reports that 36% of new CFOs hired by notable companies in the first half of 2022 were women. I ask Melanie Christ if she's encountered obstacles as a woman rising through the executive ranks. I have to say, I have not made many negative experiences. Maybe I was also a little bit in the even-ought thinking about these challenges so much. When I studied physics, there weren't many women, so I was somehow always used to it. It can also be an advantage when you're the only girl in the room. The boss at the end remembers your name and not the 19 guys who are kind of like weird oxutes and white shirts and look alike. I never experienced it as an external stress factor. I have to say for me personally it was more balancing my own expectations around getting family and the job combined. But that was probably more of a pressure I put on myself thinking that I had to be perfect in every dimension and not something where the pressure was put on me from my male colleagues. How do you take that experience and put it to play in terms of how you advance the role of women in this organization? I think the great thing is that now across the board, in finance but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we-",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3336,2022-10-15 23:25:19
15051," There's that now across the board in finance, but also in the group overall, we have role models which show young female talent that everything is possible. In finance, we have a share of women in management of 32%. So we are ahead of the group. We want to get to 35% by 2025. I think we are now at a position where if we have a vacancy, I want to have at least one woman on the shortlist. Because we have enough female talent. So every shortlist should contain a woman. And then the best person in the race should win. CEO Frank Appell says Christ sets an example for the entire organization. And he believes her success may influence the entire industry. She has proven that she is an outstanding CEO for all. And she's definitely a role model in many dimensions. That you know what I like about there. She is still you know a very warm and nice person. And that makes such a big difference. So you can get to that level without compromising on how nice you are as a person. I think she's a great role model. And I hope that this has had positive impact for many of us. From the big picture down to the smallest operational details, Melanie Christ is fully engaged in guiding DP DHL into the future. I wanted to know what she sees when she looks ahead. What do you see as the biggest opportunities for DP DHL? Over the next 10 years. I think we have a fantastic portfolio. And we just have to leverage the growth opportunities which are there, both on the ECOM site and also on the traditional B2B site. And the key differentiators for us will be digitalisation, sustainability and our great people. As you look ahead 10 years, what are some of the challenges? What keeps you up at night as you think about the business going forward? I think we have to keep this focus and the ability to adjust in a very at-lile way. Sometimes when you kind of think about all the risk controlling and stuff, people tend to create the impression that you can preplan everything. That's clearly not the case. So I think we have to stay focused and keep the ability to react in a very at-lile way. But looking at what happened over the last 24 months, I'm very optimistic that we will also be able to cope with whatever happens next. And how do you see your role changing in the years ahead? I think it is changing at a very rapid pace, which is a great thing because it never gets boring. Those elements I just mentioned for the group, overall digitalisation and sustainability are also hugely relevant for the finance role. It's like a new language you have to learn. And you learn the vocabulary, and then you also have to develop a feeling if I kind of like put so much capital into this decarbonisation measure, I get so much in terms of return out of it. But that's a fascinating opportunity where we can make a huge difference for finance and for the group overall. As you look to the future, Melanie, what do you think is going to be the skill sets, the knowledge bases, they're going to be essential to the success of future CFOs? Yes, probably the two most essential new skills will be to get even better at lifelong learning, because we will have to learn so much new stuff every year. Be it in the digitalisation area, be it on sustainability. So this ability also has a 50-year plus-old person to keep learning and keep the curiosity. I think that is going to be super essential. And the second element will be being a great team player. The world is complex, you can't know it all, so you really have to work even more strongly with your team. What advice would you give to someone who's just recently been appointed CFO? That's a great question. I think I would probably simply say, be curious and ask as many questions as you can, try to learn as much as possible, not only in the finance area, but get close to the business, try to really understand the business, because only when you are close to the business and you understand the fundamental profit drivers, will you be a really great CFO.

15052," We don't have enough women founder CEOs who are getting funding. So basically less than 2% of VC funds go to women, less than 1% go to women of color. And so in this innovation space, I said to myself, what's the best way to use capital to move things for women? And that's when I started to say, okay, I actually need to move some money into the venture capital space. And I want to do it smartly. I mean, the first goal is to make money. I'm not putting my money out as a social impact. I'm putting it out to make money. But I wanted to go behind funds like aspect ventures that's run by Theresa Gaou and Jennifer Fondstadt who are looking at these opportunities. And they have a thesis around my gosh. There are so many opportunities there if we go towards funding some of these women businesses. Some LPs have said to me, all we care about is returns. Some of the best investors may not be the best people, but they have the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know. And so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're going to dress them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent. Women control 70% of financial decisions in the house. So if you're not investing in products that go towards females or a women led company, you're missing an opportunity because you just don't see it. While Tesla's in the like make for good headlines, the reality is that even if every car on the road today won't electric, it wouldn't be enough to curb global emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions from transportation account for about 29% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. So what about the other 71%? Buildings across America burn fossil fuels to operate. What we want to do is make that all electric. Instead of burning oil and gas to give us the energy and electricity we need, we want to do 100% clean energy, all electric. We want to turn buildings into Tesla's. Just like a Tesla or an electric vehicle is all electric with no fossil fuels. We want to do that with our buildings. If we can do it in one building, we can do it in all buildings. And if we do it in all buildings, we'll reduce 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Thank you Andy so much for coming down. It's really wonderful to have you here in person. It's my pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me. I just found out we actually lived in the same dorm in college just a few years apart. So it's been almost a year since you took over from Jeff, a CEO of Amazon. And it's been a year of first, the first stock split since the.com bloom. The first vote to unionize an Amazon warehouse, your first Bloomberg technology conference. Thank you. I want to start with a quick report card. In February 2021, Jeff Bezos shocked the world by announcing plans to step down as Amazon CEO. A few months later, he passed the reins to Andy Jassy, his longtime top lieutenant, the architect of one of the company's biggest profit engines, Amazon Web Services. Bezos has stayed on as executive chair, leaving Jassy to navigate a critical inflection point in Amazon's history. How does the company manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back?

15053," Manage market turmoil, rising inflation and regulatory scrutiny, and a push by some warehouse workers to unionize all while keeping customers coming back. Joining me on this edition of Bloomberg Studio 1.0, Amazon's second CEO, Andy Jassy, he joined us from our flagship Bloomberg Technology Summit in San Francisco. I'd like you to grade your view of Amazon's performance, and we've got time later to really dig in. But quickly, how would you grade Amazon's performance over the last year with customers? Well, I think we've, you know, I'm not sure I'm the right person to grade myself during the year or not, but I'll give you my take. I think with respect to customers, I think we've done a lot of good, you know, and I think if you look at during the pandemic, which really has extended till the early part of this year, you know, so much as the PPE and food and essential items and people equipping their home offices were bought from Amazon and, you know, to scale the way we needed to. Remember, in 2020, we grew 39 percent year over year on a $245 billion revenue run rate. I mean, it's unprecedented. It's never happened before, but it was really hard to do that. And we had to take the really big footprint of the fulfillment center footprint. We built the first 25 years of Amazon and doubled it in 24 months. We built out that transportation network in just a couple years. You know, we nearly doubled the size of our workforce during that time. And I think you saw it in other businesses. AWS is a really big part of helping companies and governments have business continuity during the pandemic. And so many companies and organizations in the last year made the strategic decision that they were going to stop running their own infrastructure technology and disproportionately chose AWS to help them move to the cloud. And we've spent a lot of time helping them make that transformation. So what about investors? I mean, the stock is down significantly from a peak last year. Obviously, there's broader market turmoil. Yeah, I think, you know, for investors, financially, I'd say it's mixed. You know, I think we have some businesses that are growing really strongly. If you look at AWS, you know, in 2021, grew 37 percent year over year. It's not a $74 billion revenue run rate business. It's pretty unusual growth. And we grew 58 percent year over year in our advertising business, you know, it's a $32 billion revenue run rate business. So some businesses growing really strongly. And, you know, we've continued to grow in our retail business despite pretty crazy comparable during 2020. But I think the real challenge for us there is on the cost side. And there have been several things that have happened. Some of which are more controllable than others. You know, I think the part that's less controllable is really around inflation. And I think we thought that inflation would start to attenuate in 2022. And with the war in Ukraine, it just went the other way and has significantly accelerated. So the cost of trucking and line haul and ocean and air and fuel has just substantially gone up. And I think that will attenuate at some point. No one knows how long that'll take. I think the more controllable areas for us are really around fulfillment center capacity and productivity. It was taking about 24 months to build new fulfillment centers during the pandemic. And so we had to make decisions, you know, in mid 2020 and early 2021 on how much demand we were going to plant for it. And so, we end up with more capacity than we need right now. And there's a number of things that we're working on. We've stopped building on properties where we don't need it yet. And we've let a number of leases lapse and not a small number, you know, of both those things. We've had a lot of occasions in our history where we've worked on productivity and made improvements. And we have a lot of clearly defined issues. And I'm confident we're going to get back to the right level of profitability. You are going to sub least 30 million square feet of space. Is there a mistake in the execution there because of the overbuilding? Again, because you have to make these decisions two years in advance. And again, if you put yourself back in 2020 where we were growing 39% year over year on a 245 billion dollar revenue run rate, it's very hard to know what's the right amount to build. And you have to make a decision. And we made the decision to err on the side of our consumers and sellers. Now, how would you grade Amazon's performance with employees, your colleagues?

15054," that when I started in this gig, we had just created a new leadership principle to strive to be Earth's best employer. And I think we're, you know, we spent a lot of time trying to think through what that really means is broad. And I think we've made a fair bit of progress, but it's still early, in my opinion. But I still think there are many areas that we can keep improving, you know, and I think, you know, the first one I'd mention is safety. You know, I think that, you know, in our fulfillment centers, that is the top priority. And you know, when you get into the details and numbers and outside of all the spin of it all, you know, we're about average there, but we're not trying to be average. You know, we want to be the best in the industry and the best in the world at it. And that's a high priority and an area that I'm passionate about and the team is passionate about. And I think we have a lot of work we can do to make our employees everyday lives easier. We've identified kind of a top 100 list of areas that we can be better at, that we're just metronomically stepping through. And so we've made a lot of progress, but we've a lot of work to do still. Elon Musk just came out saying he has a super bad feeling about the economy, Tesla laying off 10% of his staff. Jamie Dimon says he's preparing for an economic hurricane. The World Bank just slashed its forecast for global growth. How do you feel about the economic climate? Well, I wasn't planning on giving any guidance to the camera. Please. But, you know, I think... Super bad or super super bad? I think there's some things that are related to Amazon that are useful to remember. You know, I think the first piece is remember that 85% of the worldwide retail market segment share is offline. And if you believe that that equation is going to flip at some point, which we do, I think it will flip over a long period of time. If you look at different downturns, you know, should we have one at some point? We've been through a few, obviously, in the 25 years that I've been at Amazon, customers change their habits. And so, you know, I also think there's, you know, those two reasons, those two factors give me some optimism that even if we have a downturn that we have the potential to still grow up, we have a roadmap that's, you know, to probably three to four. Five years long, and we're going to continue to invent, we're going to continue to be insurgent, and we have a lot of work to do to get to where we think we ultimately can get for customers. Now, when it comes to the stock, as I mentioned, it has fallen significantly. Do you think investors are missing something or has tech just been overvalued? And this also, of course, matters to employees who are significantly paid in stock? Well, you know, I look... I haven't been at Amazon for 25 years. So I arrived at the company three weeks before we went public. I have never tried to predict what the stock is going to do. In any time, I've tried to a little bit. I've been wrong. So, you know, I think it's a pretty hard... Pretty hard to predict what's going to be in any short period of time. I do really believe that Benjamin Graham-Maxham, that in the short term, the stock market tends to be a voting machine, and the long term it tends to be a weighing machine. And I think if you... We've been through a lot of points in 25 years at Amazon, where the macro factors are off and stocks are down. Our stock is down. But you can't really control that. We have a concept we talk about a lot of Amazon inputs and outputs. You know, and the ultimate output for a company is share price. You know, and then other big outputs are free cash flow or profit or revenue. You can't really manage the outputs. You have to manage at the input level, and that's where we spend all our time. And so, if you do the right things for the business long term, things tend to work out. I think we've had very good returns for investors, and I expect that to be true again.

It is crucially important and I think we've moved from this attitude from its indulgence a waste of time almost an illness that needs a cure. For something as universally important to human life as sleep, mysteries surrounding its necessity and utility have only just been recently uncovered. Some of our biggest discoveries were in the 1970s or 1980s and so it makes that a really exciting field because it seems as though we're uncovering new insights each and every day. Some scientists are going further to find out how sleep and what happens there can be harness to further expand our understanding. It's easy to memorize things that makes you smart if you can spit back a lot of facts but if you want to be wise, if you really want wisdom you gotta know when and how and why to use that information and that's what you bring figures out while you're sleeping. What are the moon shots at Amazon that are capturing most of your time and attention? What is going to define the next era of Amazon? I mean is it is it Astro the home row butter? Is it something else? Well you know we have a unique way that we go get big new investments and I'm not sure it's right or wrong it just happens to be our way and we ask ourselves when we're considering something for questions we ask if it's successful can it be big and move the needle in Amazon? Is it being well served today? Do we have a differentiated approach and do we have confidence there and if not can we acquire quickly and if we like the answer to those questions we'll go pursue it with a single threat team that isn't distracted by the rest of the business and sometimes that leads to innovation investments that seem pretty obvious like you know when I got to that company was a book's only retailer and then we expanded to music and video electronics and toys that seemed obvious to people other times that process does not lead to investments that seem obvious to people I mean AWS was something that people externally and internally thought was little bit nutty at the time but just imagine what Amazon would be today without AWS and I think that you see the same thing here you know that there are so many significant investments from making that I'm excited about I'm gonna have to constrain myself to a few but you know I'm really excited about what we're doing in the prime video space I think we're clearly on the right track there and building a significant business that's interesting because Netflix also just announced some layoffs first subscriber loss in a decade Disney cutting back on costs do you see Amazon strategy as fundamentally different from Netflix and Disney and if so how well I know we're very bullish on it and remember we all the all the models are a little bit different but for prime video we have 200 million plus prime subscribers who are you know get that entertainment for free by being part of prime and so we have a little bit different pricing model than some of the others but I'm incredibly encouraged by what we have coming if you look I mean we launched this show reacher earlier in the year was a huge hit we you know we had a new maize season we we just launched the new boys season which is how you make boys fan I am a big because Amazon bought it's very good of course we have what are the rings coming up you know in September and Thursday and football so I'm very bullish about it we also you know we're excited about what we've done with MGM you know I think some of the assets there will go very well with the rest of what we're doing entertainment wise so if you look at Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount and stars and global they're building really significant subscription businesses so I'm very bullish about that business I'm optimistic that we have a chance to build a significant grocery business which is you know early stages for us I am excited about Kuiper which is our low-earth orbit satellite that we're building you gotta remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity I mean just think about how different the world is",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3341,2022-10-15 23:47:23
15056," We're building. You've got to remember there are 300 to 400 million people in the world who have limited to no internet connectivity. I mean, just think about how different the world is when you don't have that type of connectivity. And so I think that's a really significant opportunity that has some AWS characteristics to it. I continue to be very optimistic about Alexa. You know, building the world's best personal assistant. We have 200 million endpoints already that are using Alexa. We're clearly on to something there. And then you are autonomous driving, ride hailing service and zoos that we're building, you know, here in Bay Area. I just think with the way auto consumption is evolving, I think that also is a chance to be really significant business. Now, I don't know if all of them are going to be successful, but if any one of them becomes the fourth pillar for us on top of marketplace and prime and AWS, we're a completely different company, just like we were when AWS became successful. So I think they're very worthwhile investments and bets and I'm optimistic about them. You didn't mention Astro, obviously, though, powered by Alexa. You mentioned Astro, yeah. But I mean, our home robot's going to be doing where I don't yet. Where is it? It's not really widely available for sale. What's the status? Oh, if you go one. Okay. Thank you. Everyone's very curious about Jeff's role these days. What kind of executive chair he really is. He said when he left that he'd focus his attention and energies on initiatives that he really cares about as at Amazon, but from the outside, it looks like he's really focusing on philanthropy. He's focusing on space. What kind of an executive chairmen is he? Well, Jeff is always going to be involved and he has, you know, I feel very lucky to have been in Amazon for 25 years. I feel very lucky to have worked directly for Jeff for 20 of them. And we have a really close relationship and have for a long time. And I think we share a lot of the same values about customers and how important it is to optimize for customers and how high standards they need to be, you know, given how easy it is for people to switch and the importance of invention and speed. And so, you know, I just feel very lucky to have had the chance to work so closely with him. So is your relationship, I mean, he was your only boss for 25 years, right? Is your relationship fundamentally different than it was when you were the head of innovation? Yeah, of course. You know, every single job you have, the relationship is different. You know, remember, the first couple of years I worked for Jeff, I worked as what we call his shadow then, which is really like a teeth of staff. And that was different than when I was starting AWS, which was different from when we got AWS going and it was, you know, a business that was starting to do well. And it's different when I'm in the CEO role. But, you know, the constant has always been that we have a great relationship and we collaborate really well. Amazon is poised to become the biggest private sector employer in the world. And that can only, right now Walmart is in that spot. But Amazon will probably soon surpass it. First vote to unionize at Amazon warehouse. I know you've been spending a lot of time at warehouses. When you look at someone like Chris Smalls, who I think some people look at as this modern day hero who got fired, pulled off this union vote, what's your message to someone like him, your message to the folks who think maybe we should join a union? Well, I know I think that the first thing to be clear about is that employees get to make that choice, whether they want to have a union or not. They always have had that choice and it continues to be their choice. And, you know, we happen to think they're better off without a union for a number of reasons, including the fact that, you know, it's much harder when you have a union to have a direct relationship with your manager and to get things done quickly. So if you see something on the line that you think could be better for your team or you or customers, you can't just go to your manager and say, let's change it. You know, there's a whole process in bureaucracy that you have to go through to be able to do that. You know, and we get, you know, when there's a union, we're going to get the feedback filtered by what the union decides is worth bringing up. And we'd much rather hear from every employee whatever is on their mind. And so, you know, I think if you want to continue to have the structure that we've had for all this time, you have to have really competitive benefits. And then I think if you look at Amazon's, they're very unusual in this space. We championed the $15 minimum wage several years ago. The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3342,2022-10-15 23:52:12
15057," The starting salary is now over $18 an hour, which is more than double the federal minimum wage. You get full health insurance and 401K and up to 20 weeks of parental leave. And if you want to get a college education, you haven't had one. We have a career choice program that lets our fulfillment center associate be able to do so. That is a very unusual and compelling set of benefits. And those were all accomplished without a union. So I think that we realize that we have to continue to work on the relationship with our employees. And we need to continue to provide the right benefits. And we need to continue to work on safety. And that's our intention. You made a huge mark on Amazon with AWS, obviously. What is the mark that you want to make still? I think what we've seen during this period of time is that communicating via video is not a bad. We are using all aspects of our lives to work, or learning, or communicating, for staying in touch. Lots happening on Wall Street. I think, shape how, said things that were indefensible. Need to catch up? This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week. I'm David Weston. We've got the information and insights. We think that's the next secular shift. From business's most influential and instrumental. It's knocking it out the bull path. It's a challenging dynamic. This is a level of uncertainty that we've ever had to deal with. Bloomberg Wall Street Week live Friday with replays all weekend on Bloomberg Television and Radio. The FTC has revamped its antitrust inquiry into Amazon. And by some accounts is accelerating it. Are you preparing for an antitrust lawsuit from the FTC? If you are a large company that's growing to a significant extent like we have, you have to be prepared to be scrutinized. And we have known this for some time, many years. And we have tried to run the company with that in mind. And knowing that if somebody looked, that we would stand up to that scrutiny. And I think that's what we've tried to do in running the business. We can't control whether organizations spring different suits against us. But I think if you look at our business, if you actually look at the fact, if you take out of the equation that there may not be the most objective leadership when it comes to Amazon in that organization, if you look at the facts in our retail business, we're about 1% of the worldwide retail market segment share. And remember, 85% of it is still offline. And if you look in our AWS business, we, depending on you measure it, 95% of the worldwide global IT spend is on premises. And then we have a cloud business, and then we have a portion of that. We were leading market segment share in the cloud part of this. But we operate, who we compete with, AWS is really on premises, IT, in addition to the cloud. So these are relatively small percentages of the entire pie. And you can kind of step through all the businesses. And I think simply because you've been successful in a few different businesses, doesn't somehow mean that you have a natural market power. It just means you've been successful in a couple of different customer experiences. But we still have a relatively small amount of market segment share in those areas. What about the SEC, you're being sued by them over third party data and how you've used it? Do you think in the past Amazon made mistakes with letting employees internally see how those third party sellers were doing? Well, yeah, we have pretty good control. I mean, we, you know, we of course disagree with the premise of that. But I would say that we have very good controls with respect to the...",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3343,2022-10-15 23:56:32
