It's not just about stocks and bonds. Now, it's about alternatives. How do you get more outcomes and Because there's really nowhere to hide in a world where all correlations go to one. What what let's talk about it that exactly as we have a federal reserve and other centre banks raising rates. It looks like they're gonna continue doing it for a while. It necessarily takes asset values down. Whether it stocks or its bonds and we're seeing that goodness knows in the markets overall right now. What do you do if you're an investor in that Are there some assets that are better than other assets Well, at one, I would say, this is where active management. I think comes back into the fold, right? So, there's gonna be winners and losers. Clearly, in today's environment, we see buying opportunities. You have to be careful of value traps. As well. But then you think about inflation, rising rates, while you look at middle market bank loans, senior loans, well, they have floating rate paper. You think about getting To commodities things that have a higher correlation to inflation as well. Real estate. These are all the different mixes. That's why when I talk about diversification, it's There's active management but there's also you can be more explicit in intentful to ride the wave with you know benefit from rising rates to actually be highly correlated to inflation and in an inflationary environment. You're gonna have exceptions to any rule. So you have to be careful.

The movable design was radical when it was completed in 1997. And it's inspired similar structures in flood prone cities around the world. If you look at some people in Russia, a small version of this barrier has been made over there. In the future in front of Manhattan they're thinking about a way to protect that also So this was the first one and how smaller versions are coming all over the world. But the barrier on its own isn't enough to keep water dam from flooding. Talking about climate change we see an increase of more intensive rainfall.

This means the country is struck by some of the strongest earthquakes in tsunamis in the world. In the past decade about 30 tropical storms have also hit the country each year. These natural disasters kill on average 100 to 200 people per year and take a huge toll on the country's economy But learning from painful experience Japan is built one of the world's best natural disaster response systems which includes regular disaster preparedness drills and early warning alerts Japanese engineers and architects have also pushed the boundaries of technology and design to create resilient disaster proof buildings.

Emily zooming back because I've been in crypto for a decade if you can believe it. We've seen crypto be really hot and then all of a sudden not. And so we've seen this before.
