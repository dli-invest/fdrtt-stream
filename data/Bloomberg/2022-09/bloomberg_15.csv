The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Unization in some sports. Over free agency in baseball In boxing the Muhammad Aliac which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit CNN is the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work. And who they do it for. Martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting. There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get Stay injured at times. In multiple times. Torn off how to get that reattached. The two places about my neck broken. Ain't go broken had to get that repaired I've had torn right labrum in my shoulder he broke my eyeball I mean the bone that holds up my head my left eye orbital fracture twice where my eye caved in But I knew don't blow your nose or both eyes as well At the time that UFC was bought for just two 1 million dollars ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2418,2022-09-14 00:02:08
8645,Designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts Are To fight For UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured Who the fighter fights they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different classes that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a free agent So one sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as they're strangle hold on the sporter MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC Took other competitors off the board. The UFC has such a strangle hold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down.

8649,King of expiration Until the early 20th century mapping technology was simple usually a weight attached to a long group known as a deadline. After the Titanic sank in 1912 explorers proposed using sound waves to find its hole in the north Atlantic this led to Sona the most common technique used for mapping today Operated by the schmidt ocean institute the falco is an 82 m long research vessel equipped with two multi beam so nar systems That have helped Deborah Smith and a team of other marine technicians to mop over a one 1 million square kilometers of the sea floor From somebody with AA rope with some knots to Acoustics that is I call it math magic but it is incredibly advanced mathematical technology to be able to measure the distance and time of travel of sound on a moving ship. Multibe mapping works by using Sonars so Sonar is taking sound and measurement of time so you have a multibeam sewnar and it sends out a ping of sound that sound travels to the water column hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance Each individual hang of sound has many many beams so it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor so you have many tiny little beams going across and they're travelling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and in sort of create Three dimensional image of the sea floor. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2423,2022-09-14 00:23:49

The meat alternatives that have made it to the market thus far have been plant based imitation beef and pork made from ingredients like pea protein and coconut oil by companies like Beyond Meat and impossible foods That's a very different proposition from cultured meat which is made from actual animal cells. I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system including all the plant-based proteins maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version that's fine Ask yourself in our lifetime is that diner likely to also remove the conventional option on the menu too This is more likely to be that the path to achieve that.

So we've been working with the FDA and the USDF for the last 3 years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market. As soon as we get regulatory approval in the People will be able to go to their supermarket and buy it and enjoy it. They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cells. But it's not just getting the meat right once approved the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle Raises or drop Hey, some chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to to increase that and hammering all those things of the person next 510, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection Points that will will lead to a new way of eating meat.

One of the most surprising things about visiting Guadar is the high degree of security that is absolutely everywhere. There are armed guards that are required to escort foreign visitors everywhere you go because it is contested region because there have been militant attacks in the past.

There have been some proposals to allow them underpass. It's still a little bit unclear how that is. It's finally going to be resolved. Even if those projects are eventually built there are serious questions about who will work there. There is a problem with manpower of course in Guadara.

The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been Really easy 6 to 12 months prior to build in durable liquidity you couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you operate you need to do that ahead of time it needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content moderation security that is the foundation on which you can build everything The hang calls at one point said to me you have to have the will and the means and too often by the time you have the will you no longer have the names.

By staggering the releases users may find some issues around compatibility with cross device features like retracting and editing messages and iMessage The new shared iCode photo library in the new feature for transferring Facetime calls between iPhones and iPads. It will also make it a bit harder for developers to launch apps that run on both the iPad and iPhone that require new APIs and features found across iPad OS 16 and iOS 16 Regardless it was still of course the right move Stage manager on iPad OS 16 is still quite buggy I don't find it particularly intuitive and it's not compatible with most iPads and many third party apps in the app store the feature clearly need some more polish and complaints from consumers about Manager well now no longer probably overshadow the earlier launch of the iPhone 14. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2501,2022-09-14 06:03:46

So it is hard in general just looking historically not only in the US but in developed economies in general it's very difficult to bring down inflation that is In or near double digits territory without an economic downturn.

Us stocks stayed really, really expensive from Lake Tasna 20 onwards and I was one of those people who Out on being bullish throughout the whole early part of 21 because I was like there are too expensive they're too expensive if you're optimistic buy the rest of the world you can't buy US stocks and they continue to And then it was only when we got a catalyst that they started collapsing Late 2021 that it became right to be bear stocks. So valuations are there. You gotta wait for a catalyst for them to change. I think importantly stocks should get cheap. Two reasons. One is we nearly always have an overshoot. The way this cycle works is we have these kind of overshoots and you can see that this purple line is in A 15 year average and you can see that I kind of goes up and down in a nice loop because we do have those overshoots so I expect an overshoot and the final point is The world is getting much tougher we're we're seeing a really big tightening of flash conditions we're expecting growth to slow down we're gonna see earnings come down so that would Price falling even without the peer ratio changing so I think that ultimately this just does justify the idea that stocks can trade an awful lot lower over the next 6 months over the Here.

Let's take a look at the features that time it was pretty ugly session that yesterday we have a great unauthorized piece saying like look the only question that matters Is after that inflation print in the US did the markets overreact or not he says look he'll get some of the metrics they probably didn't because it does mean we'll have much more aggressive fed hikes the complacency in those markets ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2515,2022-09-14 07:04:22
8742,"Six or the 10 year average of 17. Two it's a little bit below I think overall the conclusion from all of them is the market is now trading roughly in line with long term averages and therefore it's no longer expensive does that mean it's a buy not necessary I think it's important to know where But remember that just provides the backdrop. You need a catalyst. A great example was the market according to these kind of metrics. Looked extraordinary expensive from late 2020 but it wasn't Late 2021 we actually saw the pain if you were trading off valuations well then you missed out a lot of the end of the rally in 2021 and I am one of those camp that thought the US market look too expensive too early so where can I go from here there's two reasons to think It'll probably go a lot lower. One is these markets tend to overshoot and you can see this the 15 year moving average is that purple line and you can see and it goes in nice cycles. We expect over Downside. The other reason is the environment is getting much worse. Financial conditions are tighten We're expecting growth to slow and we're expecting earnings from companies to suffer a bit which means that just for the P to stay steady we need prices to come lower but I Over the next 6 months 1 year. Okay your further squeeze on this multiples is real yields get to levels we haven't seen since 2018 as well Bloomberg MLI managing editor Mark Cardinal fantastic thank Join us now is Grace Peters head of a mere investment strategy at JP Morgan and Christina Keno from our markets team. Christine, we're gonna start with you. Set themselves up for this hiding yesterday when are they gonna learn that inflation Sticky stateside Yeah Tom I mean this is ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2516,2022-09-14 07:08:58
8743,"So I think what we learned yesterday with with CPI which undoubtedly was strong across so many categories including critically that goods That we hope to is gonna start showing signs of disinflation but I think all of that just means that 75 basis points for next week is absolutely cemented. Potential for upside but also that that window for for when you know you could see that the the pace of steps down is is push A terminal rate up. And so all of that to me needs to tighten monetary policy. Greater recession risks and an upside risk to the dollar downside to risk assets. Oh great. Overall was the market reaction justified. It was pretty ugly, pretty violent, and pretty quick. But look at where we'd come from in the four trading days into this print. The market was telling you it Wanted to believe that you know peak peak inflation was was here and so we saw that very steep you know five percentage rally in the SMP in the four trading days before the print again a mature pull In the dollar so I think the move is is justified cuz certainly when it comes to equity markets you know they were starting to look reasonably full we know that PMI is tell us that earnings need to come down and therefore you are looking for multiple support You can't run on multiples so I think I think fair and we see a range bound equity market between now and the end of the year between the rangers of 3640- 100 would be suited that the kind of range area that we'd like to take Yeah 3602 hours is sort of where a maldro session is discounted. And then the 40 42 is is is more the sort of the soft land Scenario for the end of this year with modest progression than next year as well.

Grace thank you so Grace Peter is there. We'll get back to you. Of course State of the Union address I think she's talking a lot about energy and of course it'll be interesting to see Individually implemented trying curb some of that energy usage. Any news on that and winful taxes as well. I'm watching the utility sector particularly the energy providers of course on the on the back of this. So we'll continue to bring you lines as the commission present speaks there. In parliament. There's plenty more coming up including any more lines I say.

Yeah so for more we're joined by Bloomberg's Europe correspondent Maria today in Strasburg for us. So Mariana the speech just started about 10 minutes ago. We're going to hear about how they were curb some of the energy usage. Yes, Francina, you know, this is normally a speech that's very political as a state of the European Union but this year, in particular, it feel Mentors, of course, there's a war going on actively in Europe, there's the energy crisis, and there's also the Ukrainian first lady Olanska, who's here with the head of the commission, I think a lot This is full support for Ukraine and I was struck by the language from the head of the commission just now who said it's not just Warren Ukraine but Russia's also waging war now on our energy our values this is a darker sea versus democracy it's Strong language, very strong political symbol from the head of the commission in terms of the details around the energy. I think Francing by now it's clear. This is a twofold But also power generators that do not use gas would strike into Either this morning is every official that I've spoken with they say don't call it a text it's a solidarity contribution let's see what the company say though.

8746,For an investor looking to get exposure. How do you time this? It's very difficult time this I would go with what warm bar access you want to price the market you you don't want to time the market and you know I would take a photo two five% deal on the 2 year And take stock of what it is done so far and I think that by that time the economy will start to lose it's eight points that we are seeing at the moment so there's still a long way to go We are approaching that threshold Exactly just yet. Even I know that's actually in your live blog and I urge everyone to go and look at it. You talk about the tell tell 10 year or 3 month part of the yield curve and the fact that it's So I wanna ask Grace Peter's what this means for market positioning Well it tells you that the market's very concerned about the restrictive monetary policy stance. We also have the 2 year 10 year part of the curve inverted and materially inverted for much of the year. But looking at that shorter dated segment as Just says that the market's getting closer to to to that point. I mean we think fixed income in the portfolio is going to play a vital role over the next 6 to 12 months. You know we are having to manage portfolios for a range of outcomes That is quite unprecedented And so fixed income you know right now offers us an attractive yield if you wanna stay short dated and and up in quality in US investment grade has been one of our key themes also if the recession hits and if ultimately then we ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2520,2022-09-14 07:26:14
8747,The region but I think that undoubtedly you know I mentioned before a 50 50 chance of a recession in the US's our base case that chance has to be Hire. When we think about it relative to Europe but it's one of the key reasons why we have been moving our assets out of the regional. We we are much more dollar based. We we believe that the the dollar bull market is going to continue not just cos of eight differentials but also risk of version. And therefore you know very much focused on the US When it comes to investment opportunities Thank you so much Chris Peters.

The headlines are seeing us continue to sell off in bonds whether it's US cruiseries but also here in Europe as cause as well peripherals like the Italian debt as well back above four% on your 10 year and the moves lower across the By about six tenths of a percent not as dramatic as the day we saw on Wall St yesterday after that CPI print came in stronger than expected it's the core it was went that linkage to wages gasoline prices yes they came off but almost everything else was sticky and more And of course most investors that expected here in the UK those CPI came in a little softer the debate continues around market participants in terms of the view on the BIE next week 50 or 75 currently seeing losses Around one% on the UK index the dacks is down by five tenths of a percent let's switch it over see how things are playing out across these sectors then leading the losses the last time I looked was in terms of games I should say was retail part of that is intext the Spanish retailer coming Individual stop up around five% the last time I checked the bottom list utilities down one.

8749,"40 has come to the end of its time. So what do you do or should I go to cash? Because actually realise I was a supply shop central banks are powerless. I wouldn't go to cash. I think staying invested is the right thing to do. There's a bit of a cheap question. Fair enough. First of all what I would do is definitely move away from structures where our locations to different asset classes remain fixed over time. So again the 60 40 men set for a long period of time. The balance of those two assets in portfolios wouldn't be changed. That is no more. The level of volatility that we are observing is Driven by macro factors and that More frequent reviews and changes in terms of arsenical location. Number two, it requires Into how we construct before your higher level of uncertainty and number three we need to deal with the climate transition which as we saw from the state of the union speech is very much in motion and present a big financial risks for all of us. Where are you in terms of clients adjust It's a to the end of 60 40 then many retail investors will come to Black Rock precisely for those kind of products I think that's gonna be an incredible amount of money in motion going forward That revolution is just at the beginning and I believe you know against the backdrop that it's certainly Plex. It presents a great opportunity for the industry and for end investors to prepare for a better outcome going forward. There was a when you say that portfolio allocations that need a longer time horizon, right? Does that mean that we're going to see a huge correction in the Or just volatility that we can't predict. I watched tend to say the letters so again the the type of volatility that we're seeing is different from what we observed in the past.

And how much more in terms of upping the anti markets will push the fed and however they will respond and validate this idea that you know what? I think they're not done. They're nowhere near close to done in terms of these jumbo rate heights and actually they're gonna have to go even harder.

Part of this is the definition of short term. How short is short term for the different chapters of your book? Of course some investors are trading daily but for people that do what I have typically done which is private equity it's a longer term investment hold which is typically 3 to 5 years clearly people like Warren Buffett are holding Generally investors who put money to work are trying to get some kind of good rate of return somewhere between a three and 5 year period of time typically in the private equity or venture capital growth capital areas David were you surprised what any of these luminaries said in terms of their investing secrets or their mantras?

We think there's a decent chance although our base case is spreads wide and a bit into you and Double down really get you to explain because we heard something similar from Wayley that a slowdown was already being priced at the credit spreads even as you had the like of JP Morgan's Bob Michael coming out and saying actually they're got a lot more to widen they have to recognize the pain that stocks are starting to price in on the margins and moves like yesterday so What exactly what kind of slow down are credit spreads currently implying? ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2599,2022-09-14 13:11:56

Oksana are enough of JP Morgan. I'm guessing Alexander is not constructive on this credit market.

The credit Staring at if not already in recession and we're seeing you know one of the areas that also gets talked about a Is the fundamental strength of the corporate market and I think that that is present. However, if you look at the trend, you see that profit margins, yes, they have remained strong in queue two, but if you strip out energy and transportation which of course benefits from lower energy prices You see that those profit margins have actually come in at negative one% quarter over quarter and minus almost 6 year% over year for the rest of the lower rated market and they're led by you know lower profit margins and retail in health care and food so all the areas that find it very difficult to pass Post onto the consumer and that trend will continue profit margins will continue to experience problems and we will continue to see it reflected in spreads.

I will tell you one thing I take a lot of issue with what the market is pricing in for next year which is nothing other than the Fed making you turn and becoming And it is quite clear to me that the fed is going to pursue it's aggressive stance and eventually become perhaps neutral but not accommodative and that's not what our prices are reflecting Someone earlier mentioned our last hiking cycle, the 2015, 2018, which was extraordinarily benign. We had inflation at barely two%. We had higher unemployment and still we had for example, you know, lower credit spreads after the last fed hike back then where in the high five hundreds, 575 if I remember correctly and today, you know, when Talks about fairy value and credit. What's really what's fair value right now? How yield this pricing significantly below twenty-year average? Forget, you know, 20 year recession average. So, I think there is definitely a lot of complacency since still being placed into this market, being priced into this market, and we need to really be focused on high quality, flo Rate.

One night on the television news they announced the latest winning number. 349. The problem was Four nine had already been allocated as a non winning number in earlier campaigns.

Soon after Hollywood blockbusters armageddon and deep impact brought attention and fear to the masses The great news is that the vast majority more than 90% of all really large one km near earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are Quite capable causing a lot of damage but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're small. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system? We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system Most of them however are between Mars and Jupiter and what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the astros in the inner part of our solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There is another population though that kind of leaks inward and gets into the Somewhat close to the earth And we call these near earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of sort of around 2025, 1000 something like that When we first spot an object, we we really know very little about it.

It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing And the idea was then, like, well, let's not do that. This is basically what Nance is doing. Now, she's taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbits And I see what fractions sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And that they call it the potential infector. So you calculate the solar system forwards in time for let's say a 1000 years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface You calculate them backwards to today And then you get your orbital parameters of today's astro which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known infectors. In the solar system Can simulations and and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex and it's a physics to get more complex. The mathematics becomes more complex. And at some point you can't solve your problems and analytically anymore. And then this is where the computer comes in. Now we have this train neural network.

And then 2 days later I made another one and that one got 12 views and then I just started pumping out more and more content and people were like, this guy knows what he's talking about. It really just started building on top of itself and then it was like My channel really focuses on tips and tricks so I A straight 18 hours and I'll finish the game or get told about the 40 hour mark and then I'll make my first video while I'm going through a giant notepad and just scribbles everywhere and I make these Of like the things that stumped me So I know the things that may stump other people What do you need to think about if you're building your YouTube channel?

I want you to get to the near shore. 50 m the whole water column is moving backwards and forwards. As we search for ways to reduce our lands on fossil fuels some are looking to a largely untapped potential source of renewable energy. In theory waves off the coast of the United States alone could generate over two 1 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity a year. Enough to power more than Of the country. Intensifying subside not as quickly as the wind and that means that it can produce a smoother power generation curve. One of the potential advances of wave energy is that it could act as a complimentary source of power. Compared to other renewables on the grid if it was Scaled up to commercial scale. For decades engineers have been trying to convert wave energy into electricity. But a host of technological and financial challenges have complicated their efforts. In the years from around 2006 to 2015 there were a speed of bankruptcy in the sector. And this was largely because of a lack of kind of continuous Proven projects out at sea with reliable electricity. She's generation. Since then companies have been trying to develop the technologies but a steadier pace and with a smaller cash burn.

The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibralta since 2016. Which is enough to power 100 households. Currently anyone her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Porter Jaffa in Telaviev The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid Going forward is to expand it to all suitable break waters in the city of Telavi and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today engineer is an entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few 100 kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the filters come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would More confidence in the success wave and energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago but in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive diesel power or out at On gasty commissioning rigs or for pairing underwater or timeless vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2640,2022-09-14 16:09:56

In other words, Had to deliver results Japanese prosecutors to avoid his own criminal liability and he's accusing and leading the investigation of Carlos Gone.

So Paul Commons is a trader who cut his teeth in in the pits in the the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname his was cuddles If you can imagine that was a very sort of Type of world where people are doing, you know, hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars trades by shouting each other.

You know, anyone that covers markets is gonna be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BPs of the world, your Glen course, but is this tiny firm and one of the big challenges that we had was Finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious. At first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the vague a capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became Cleared that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together. They would go on holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members over the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging And it really just was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who all had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts and it's basically a contract that says I'm gonna buy a 1000 barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a 1000 barrels of oil to you At this point in the future.

Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q eight or Canada. They sell oil. An average of the WTI closing price over the proceeding month so the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q eight potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of all they sold that month.

Believers committing to net oh initiative Achieve a net oh emissions world. We began looking at these corporate claims of of dramatically reduced emissions and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to to to achieve these names. And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves Found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they what they seem to be. As we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits We saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a one 1 billion dollars a year and revenues. And they've been around for seven decades They've preserved about 125 1 million acres of land They've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners.

Nature conservancy and many others see that the carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to Further their own benevolent aims. But unfortunately what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening. So, the nature conservancy defends vigorously these deals and and they and and others will say, look, our projects are just following the rules that these registry Up.

And why does it actually matter Christine Lee Edwards explains. Hydrogen the most plentiful element in the universe. On earth we find that mostly bonded to oxygen in the form of water or in other gases known as hydrocarbons hydrogen gas Htwo burns hot and clean making it an attractive tool in the race to net oh but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task Today the cheapest way to do this is via chemical processes that break up natural gas. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is used electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct. A lot of electricity is needed. And Power comes from burning cold or gas. Hydrogen produced in this way. Power by fossil fuels It's called Grey hydrogen. If carbon captured storage is used together with fossil fuels then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power issues, it's called pink.

Walmart is very keenly aware of what all of its customers really need and and kind of the gaps that can be filled and so they've talked a lot about how they want this to be something that's affordable. So you can you Imagine that they're probably won't be a lot of fees attached to this new account. So, yeah, I think it's a very interesting move for them. I will say they've tried this in the past. So, this is not Walmart's first foreign definance. And they haven't always been successful. So, I think they're taking another whack at it. They're trying to go a little bit more digital, a little bit more flashy, so we'll see if this time makes a difference. How long ago Debit card. Okay.

So, even though, It could be a smart move from Walmart this is a really crowded field already because a lot of companies are going after that under bank consumer yeah no that's exactly right I do think the fact that they so one of the big problems facing those other companies right now is they have to spend so much money acquiring customers and these guys have kind of the built-in advantage you know they've got the world's largest retailer 5000 plus stores ready to advertise this, put this in front of their shoppers, put this in front of there and please so that helps a lot.

In this warehouse alongside startups from across the US architecture firm AI space factory a refining the production of Marsha A four story structure they created for a Nasa competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call institution resource utilization so use the materials that are there If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be So the idea is to send a threeD printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that.
