We have to rethink our network of our suppliers And he outlines the mindset that makes the chief future officer If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adopt, you have to anticipate on what comes next. The strategic thinking is very key for that purpose. This is Bloomberg We make it very transparent to the shopper before they accept an order. What's your order? It's gonna look like how much we're gonna pay them and how much like so consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or as I'll say we use it.

7671,Say we we are already working for a 1000 years on this topic. Keeping the water out isn't a new challenge for another ones It's a battle they've been fighting for centuries. So when the effects of climate change started to crap up they were like yeah let's do this we're ready. We traveled to Riderdown to find out how this city is getting ready for the future and whether the ingenious stuff they've come up with we'll ultimately be enough to save them And hopefully the rest of us too. When you look at Holland or the Netherlands then the name the Netherlands already says that we are a low line country One for this country is below and two third is funeral to flooding. Back in the day the only things keeping the water at bay were the dikes which are basically just raised amounts of earth. Once every few decades the water would overwhelm the dikes and cause catastrophic flooding. And that was just the way things were.

7672,Not by keeping the water out But by giving it a place to go This is the water square and it is actually you could say a symbol for our approach how to become climate adaptive. So under normal circumstances this square can be used as for example a basketball field. But on days like this it's stores access rainwater and keeps it from flooding the streets. So it's a multi-functional solution We want to add quality to the urban space but in this way we are also adding a water storage This is the first water square that we have been developing but it's part of a bigger package of measures. An interesting one close by here is what we call the duck park or the the rooftop park Which is a kind of a long levy of one km and on top of it a huge rain park It's storing excessive rain or water because of the green roof. Looking at the challenges released from to climate change a lot of people think it's going to cost us a lot of space and money And we try to show that also can use it to work on a better city. Some ways the Dutch are just as baffled as the rest of us about climate change.

They're the dirty particulates that cause smog in cities Spat out by diesel cars, scooters, and buses. Hydrogen is characterized by much wider flammability limits which means we can go to much leaner combustion and as a result we can burn it much lower flame temperatures and that's a better for reducing oxymissions. Going leaner means burning fuel with an excess of air in the engine using something like gasoline Ornaments far if you were hydrocarbons Doing it with hydrogen also delivers cleaner emissions. Pollutant Hydrogen combustion produces up to 90% less nitrogen oxide than kerosene So while burning hydrogen isn't technically as clean as using it inside a fuel cell It's still a huge improvement over jet fuel.

David, I think you could spend a couple hours looking through all the fundamental data and not find anything that really supported a big increase in risk appetite this week. So, they really have to attribute it to the fact that we had a couple weeks of softness proceeding this and then, send them to terrible and then technically, the market is making higher lows.

So, Sarah, what are we all missing? I mean, you're a new V and you see all this stuff. I know you've got some secret What are the markets missing? What are we missing? One of the key issues for the markets is valuations. This is what we're surprised to see is that valuations for stocks actually And even with earnings at risk, they could look even more expensive. If you look at history during periods of high inflation where you tend to eventually hit a recession, mark it returns can be quite strong after that, but if you look at valuations in those historical periods, there are much lower when that happens, so that's why we're more concerned about the markets, and think that it's like a evaluations need to crack before we would get Oh, that's interesting. So, we got further to go down and you think at least so what do you agree with that Jim or do you have something else you think the markets are missing? So, our experiences that while evaluations clearly are important, they're much more important to long-term returns than they are to 12 month returns. There's a very little statistical relationship on a short-term basis. So, we don't look evaluations as a timing But they're very important for intermediate to long-term returns.

They're looking for places that they can find Talent IT talent is scarce what we're finding is that access to talent is still the biggest bobble neck to productivity and so companies on an increasing basis whether it's taxes or other places in the United States or or even globally are working more This hub and spoke model where they might have a center of excellence or or a hub in one individual city outside of the main headquarters and increasingly we're finding that is happening outside of Silicon Valley.

We have to coach our colleagues and team members and my job the way I think about it is we have to shine the spotlight on their strength.

So, Ethan, let's first begin with what the ultimate goal is and that is 50% reduction from 2005 levels in carbon emissions by 2030. The numbers looking at the contents of this legislation How close are we gonna get to that? Well unfortunately the answer is we'll see. Because unlike other policies this one was not written with a hard COtwo goal included in it. There's no carbon price. There's not a cabin trade market. So there's not a specific goal legislated here that we're trying to achieve. But Think that the estimate so far around 40% seem generally reasonable there are many reasons there are many many factors that could impact whether the US actually does cut emissions 40% by 2030 we might even do better than that it's certainly We might do a little bit worse. There are a lot of factors that play and not all of them are directly involved with the energy sector. Obviously, how quick the economy grows has an enormous amount to do with whatever's overall COtwo emissions pathways look Okay so there is some room for error and even in the best case scenario in a perfect world where everything goes according to plan there's still a golf between what the actual 2030 And what we think this bill may be able to provide in the best case scenario Given what isn't in the bill how else are we gonna get to that extra 10 We need.

If you look at history during periods of high inflation where you tend to eventually hit a recession, mark it returns can be quite strong after that, but if you look at valuations in those historical periods, there are much lower when that happens, so that's why we're more concerned about the And think that it's like a good evaluations need to crack before we would get interested.

We have to rethink our network of our suppliers. And he outlines the mindset that makes the chief future officer successful If you start with a view that the world is in constant change and you have to adopt.

What's the order? It's gonna look like how much we're gonna pay them and how much like the consumer is paying them. And so they can decide whether they take an order or was else it refuse yet.

Some of the best investors may not be the best people Had the best returns. What do you have to say to those people? I have to say you're investing in what you know and so you need to look at what trends are coming in the nation and how you're gonna address them. Women are 85% of consumer dollars spent.
