6235,If you look at a thermal image of a city and then compare that to a map of vegetation you'll find that weather's greenery the temperature is lower. That's because things like asphalt concrete and shingled roofs absorb more heat from the sun than trees. This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing up in populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event more than tornadoes hurricanes and even floods. That's why Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called Cooling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learned to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world Starting with Singapore In Singapore close to the equator temperatures regularly rise above 32°C or 90°F And the city structures only make it worse.

Campun Admiralty the community center that contains health facilities and social spaces now provides more green space than the plot of land it was originally built on It's topped by a roofscape of staggered terraces covered in local plants which functions as a community park. And a village green in the center that contains farm plots for residents to tend to. Park royal on pickering was designed as a hotel in a garden that doubled the green growing potential of its site. There's now 15 1000 m of sky gardens reflecting pools waterfalls planter terraces and green walls And the government has big plans as well. Singapore actually has a plan to plan one 1 million trees and add more green spaces over the next 10 years. It is actually a mix of one thing to reduce the urban heat island effect. But on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature. But it's not enough The city state has still been warming twice as quickly as the world average over the past six decades. That's why calling Singapore has developed a catalogue of other potential heat mitigation measures.

6253,Anything like it's WTI this morning down more than 35%. Have been so surprised if the oil price had fallen to oh but the all price went to minus 38 it went far lower than anyone had expected and so lots of people on the market were saying well hang on something else is going on here A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had made a huge amount of money that day and potentially had some part to play and what happened? The information we got was the nine traders at Vega Capital London have made in the region of 660 1 million dollars in 1 day as a group I think they made as much money in 1 day as Apple makes from its international sales in 1 day I mean it's an insane some of mine did they pull off a fantastic Did they predict the way the market was moving and get it absolutely right or was there something else going on and had they actually Push the market and that investigation is is ongoing. So Paul Commons is a trader who cut his teeth in in the pits in the the 80s and 90s when everyone had a nickname his was cuddles If you can imagine that was a very sort of Type of world where people are doing you know hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars trades by shouting at each other Giving hand signals and then scrolling on scraps of paper ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,80,2022-09-06 16:46:21
6254,"Which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London and they were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets is gonna be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BPs of the world, your Glen course, but is this tiny firm? And one of the big challenges that we had was Finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious. No first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Vega Capital website it says it's under construction. If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected. It's the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together. They would go on holiday together. We found out that a number of them were members over the West Ham supporters club in London. A few of them started Companies together so you could see all the connections between them and start to see a distinct group emerging and it really just was was this kind of shock that you know this wasn't just like a hedge fund or a firm you'd never heard of. This was actually a group of buddies who All had the same experience on this day and it had all made a huge amount of money. So if you're an oil trader there's a number of different ways you can trade and and probably the most popular is WTI futures contracts and it's basically a contract that says I'm gonna buy a 1000 barrels of oil from you at this point in the future or I'm going to sell a 1000 barrels of oil to you At this point in the future. It's actually just a financial contract to gamble on to predict whether oil is gonna go up or down. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,81,2022-09-06 16:50:34
6255,Group of the nine most profitable traders made 660 1 million dollars or thereabouts between them. I mean if you can imagine I think three or four of them made inaccessive 100 1 million each. One of the astonishing things about this trade is that two of the individuals who made more than 100 1 million In a single day we're in their 20s one of them was 22 years old you know only a few years earlier he'd been posting on his social media about doing teenage stuff with his mates in town and going to see girls and rap music and here he is a few years later making a 100 1 million dollars in Single days trading. When me and Liam discovered that we were just we couldn't believe it. We couldn't believe what we were seeing. All trading is a is a oh sum game anytime you're making money as an all trade as someone else is losing it amongst the biggest losers were the investors in this Chinese fund crude oil treasure fund There were thousands of them and they lost everything. Lots of people have put their savings into oil funds. They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q eight or Canada. They sell oil As an average of the WTI closing price over the proceeding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37 meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and Q eight potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of all they sold that month. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,82,2022-09-06 16:55:12

We began looking at these corporate claims of of dramatically reduced emissions and we noticed so many of these companies were using carbon offsets to to to achieve these names And as we begin to look at the carbon offset projects themselves We found is that the environmental benefits claimed by these companies are not actually what they what they seem to be. As we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus We saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy This surprised us the nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group they have about a one 1 billion dollars a year in revenues And they've been around for seven decades They've preserved about 125 1 million acres of land They've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners The nature conservancy is taken a different approach.

Hydrogen gas Htwo burns hot and clean making it in attractive tool in the race to net oh but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task.

And if this Comes from burning cold or gas. Missions goals of using hydrogen to begin with hydrogen produced in this way powered by fossil fuels is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture a storage is used together with fossil fuels then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power issues, it's called pink. Renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free.

Kids YouTube for the unaware can be adorable. It can be boring. It can also just be flat out strange. But often it involves toys and for toy makers who embrace the platform it led to record success.

Since 2000 with the cable channels dedicated to kids Disney channel Nickelodeon cartoon network there became the opportunity to reach kids in mass numbers The week The the toy industry is continued to grow. The most part was a pretty solid business just you know growing a couple percent a year here and there there be big big years here and there when there's maybe a hit movie Like a Star Wars movie come out you know drive a lot of toy sales 2014 to 2019 the global toy industry would grow by 15%. At about the same time those major cable networks of Nickelodeon Disney channel and cartoon network would lose half their total audience. 2017 also saw the bankruptcy of toys are us. As both And kids discovered and bought more toys online. Think about kids they're usually the the first adopters of a new Kids weren't watching things like Nickelodeon as much as they used to.

I consider the first So to speak unboxing star and they would open toys and kids were just mesmerized by it. They loved watching it. And next thing you know, you had literally 50 unboxings. They were unboxing just about every toy. You know, it was and people were just really excited. You open the toy and you see a toy pop out Just got excited see the piece by piece yeah he's he's in a bathroom wearing a he's eating a lobster you know the early days of these unboxing videos the videos were you know from adult's perspective Terrible. I mean, they were 10 minutes long. They were boring. It was a shaky camera. There was actually no production value If you think about these executives, you know, they're they're trying to figure out how to reach this new audience And they're they're brought these videos and say we'll look at this video it has And it's terrible. When I first heard of it, I thought it was the weirdest thing. It just seemed kinda bizarre. Who would wanna watch someone opening a toy, taking it out of the box, but then when I started thinking about this idea of exploration and discovery as a core play pattern, the most fund Play pattern there is. It it started to make sense I think that I have to say that the company that that really jumped on that in the most concerted way was MGA with their launch of LOL. LOL surprise at three Doll play which is you know basically the most popular ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,166,2022-09-06 23:01:04

And in 2016 spin master would launch a more expensive blind box toy it called patchimals. But the thing that sets aloe surprise apart is that it manly focused on YouTube. I'm not putting ads on YouTube but working with creators and influencers to get their products in their hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos. For MGA actually the the move towards YouTube was was kind of a bit lucky and almost having necessity. In late 2015, Nickelodeon Parent Company via com with Sue MGA for breach of contract after it failed $Three. 5 million for the production of a TV series based on their Lala Lucy dolls To flex their muscle David You don't agree to or Seeing things in the conflict that we had.

This idea of imitation. So, when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neurons in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience, the more kids felt what it would Like to have it and then wanted to experience it themselves. You know, when the criticisms of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's An advertisement versus real content That's a big criticism of this industry. Is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube, a young ages, not being supervised by their parents. I just watching these videos And they don't realize that maybe that influencers getting paid by the brand to do that video or there's some other compensation and that you know blurs the lines for kids is there sort of developing and figure out how to consume media.

Is Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases The course of my reporting I've talked to almost 54 more employees at Edia BNB and you know seven or eight of those work directly on this elite unit these safety agents many of them come from military backgrounds or trauma backgrounds the a trained to handle traumatic situations and to try and you know help people who are Through what what may be you know the worst day in their lives For these safety agents a lot of them understood that they had a jewel role First and foremost they wanted to protect the user in crisis But they also knew they had a responsibility to protect the company's brand in public image.

They offered to cover any health or lee or counseling costs that she might need later. But inside the company internally they also launched an investigation they wanted to know How did the alleged rapist get the keys how did he get inside that he'd be When they found out that the keys had been left at the corner bodega Being created, you know, a problem of liability for your BNB. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for Airbnb they also you know they wanted to know what was gonna be said in court they wanted to know if any media were gonna pick up on the story And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. A week later the alleged rapist was indicted and the supreme court in New York and Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was gonna be mentioned in any of the court records and it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And you know B and B that was kind of lucky.

With federal funding proposed to stop in 2025 opening the station to private enterprise would free up resources for the space agency's ambitions to return to the moon and journey to Mars Transferring to more commercial model is allowing industry to take over many of those areas that Nasa has traditionally been responsible for like the design and operations and maintenance of space systems but the most exciting part I think is new opportunities the iPhones would have never come from the government ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,173,2022-09-06 23:31:25
