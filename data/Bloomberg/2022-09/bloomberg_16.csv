There's a guy in the sport from the guy who just got his first fight all the way up to the Conor McGregor's that is pleased with the way the UFC treats fighters. The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Unionization in some sports. Over free agency in baseball In boxing the Muhammad Ali act which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work. And who they do it for?

What is I'm looking at this thick contract and wondering what I should do Dana White looks at me and says Don't worry this thing takes off we'll take care of you The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's power is the contracts that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were ported over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts Are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured Who the fighter fights they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different clauses that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from the UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a free agent So one sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as they're strangle hold on the sporter MMA got so much stronger.

I'm a huge fan of any company of any person trying to make a product that's improving the food system including all the plant-based proteins maybe in some future menu you'll have this kind of cultivated chicken and you'll also have a plant-based version that's fine but I guess you have to ask yourself in our lifetime is that diner likely to also The conventional option on the menu too.

There's a lot of similarity on how we grow the meats from various animals or fish but they're also different because the nutrients they need and how they actually come together to form the final product the meat and I think it's very similar to how we also grow various animals. There's similarities in the feed that we give cows and takes and chickens But there's also difference is how we cultivate and it's very similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDF for the last 3 years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market.

And when does that start to come through in Fed language and Fed Operations then because of the moment we're seeing these jumbo hikes 75 maybe even 100 in several people's views. So we think the kind of hiking they're putting into the system now is already enough to put the credit cycling in the US into a recessionary state. So towards the end of the earth you're going to the end of the year you should see inflation Growth weakening and the market will have to react to that. Okay, and then are you thinking is the team at Bank of America thinking that we're gonna get 75 is 100 still is 100 really being thought about sensibly or would that be something of a of an alarm bell or maybe looks a little Yeah I think that's a good way of putting it I think it's not out of the question especially because they're always CPI was a shocker so I think 75 is the base case but there is AA tail risk that it might be 100 but it's assigned that they're really panicking Where do you position in US stocks? Yeah, exactly.

So, will your view depend on the fiscal stimulus? It absolutely will. So, we're looking at the cycle and we're saying, what are the drivers of the cycle? If they are net negative, we'll be positioned for for deceleration. The operating assumption we have at the moment is that around half of the pain that we're seeing from deteriorate and Will be offset by the fiscal side IE it's a softener but it's not a game changer but clearly if the fiscal numbers are large enough then we have to reconsider and we have to accept it's an unusually Macro environments.

So I think the key questions are A would it lead to a slowdown in grow Very lucky yes and then the most interesting discussion that we're having with investors right now if the gas price continues into next year does it mean that growth will then continue to decelerate and there we have a more to mystic idea because what matters ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2837,2022-09-15 06:30:43

But Europe I think does look a lot in more inexpensive and the reason that of course is that Europe has suffered from more problematic economic environment as the moment. High energy prices are very much a bigger spiking inflation that hit to real incomes the geopolitical risks are really centered around Europe I think in the way that European markets performed it seems to be discounting or implying grow slowing but not a real recession yet in there if I look at the way the PMI is the personal manager's surveys in the high 40s just kind of where they are at the moment but I think they could dip it a little bit lower so again I think the European market's a bit vulnerable too. I wouldn't expect another 20% down in shares. I think that is quite bearish particularly on European stocks. That would send them down to the kind of evaluations The financial crisis but a little bit further down yes I think that's the risk. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2847,2022-09-15 07:14:00

Yeah so it it there's lots of things going on with the energy market and you're a person there I mean Hey there's potential eventually you may see an end to this war or if you saw it into the war and into the sanctions then you might start seeing flows of gas again you we think in the near term that's quite unlikely but you know it's it's Energy prices globally they've come down a little bit as you've had some global growth weekend I think the week of global growth gets the more than energy prices globally will come down but the problem is it's still meeting a lack of supply of global energy so while yes Is coming down. You, you, you really don't have a lot of supply particularly with oil, gas, globally, and that's what's really caused all these spikes. So, I think that those things still mean that the company is own those assets. Should be web position for the medium term. So, short-term risk with gross weakening.

We're essentially at war with another nation. That holds so much energy. It is does this show us really the limited scope of Central Bank.

So you calculate a shoulder system forwards in time for let's say a 1000 years And then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface. You calculate them backwards due today And then you get your orbital parameters Of today's astro to which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known infectors. Simulations and and AI can those things fill in the gaps where perhaps telescopes and and other imaging tools can't. Absolutely. Since the observations get more complex. The physics gets more complex and if the physics we get more complex the mathematics becomes more complex and at some point you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then this where the computer comes in. Now we have this train neural network. We have a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds. Whether not an estro. It is potentially dangerous or not For redefining how it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before Because the more time you have the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to to move an object decide. It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid.

Today engineers an entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few 100 kilowatts of wave energy a deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the field has come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago but in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive Or out at sea on gasty commissioning rigs or for parring underwater or Thomas vehicles.

The price of oil has collapsed to a record low. We've never really seen anything like it. WTI this morning down more than 35%. Rise if the oil price had fallen to oh but the all price went to minus 38 it went far lower than anyone had expected and so lots of people on the market were saying well hang on something else is going on here. A couple of months later I started to get wind through a kind of network of sources that a tiny firm in the outskirts of London had Huge amount of money that day and potentially had some part to play and what happened? The information we got was the nine traders of vaca capital London had made in the region of 660 1 million dollars in 1 day as a group I think they made as much money in 1 day as Apple makes from its international sales in 1 day I mean it's an insane some of mine did they pull off a fantastic trade did they predict the way the market Moving and get it absolutely right or was there something else going on and had they actually Something the breached market rules in a bid to to push the market and that investigation is is ongoing. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2978,2022-09-15 16:45:51

And it's 20 minutes to cheap ride away from the city. Earlier in the summer we have this lead which is that there's this tiny firm called Vega Capital London They were the biggest winners from the biggest oil crash in history. You know, anyone that covers markets is gonna be surprised about that. You know, you're thinking your BPs of the world, your Glen course, but is this tiny firm and one of the big challenges that we had was actually finding out who worked with Vega Capital. It wasn't immediately obvious, not first we had absolutely no idea. If you go to the Capital website it's there just under construction If you do basic online searching it's very difficult to find anyone who's publicly connected to the company. So inevitably we're incredibly curious at this point. Like who the hell are these people? The more reporting we did the more it became clear that this group were connected socially as well as professionally. They went to weddings together. They played golf together.

Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the nature conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. So this scenario that they've put forward to get carbon revenues is not really plausible And what that means is when you have Disney coming in and buying these credits. When it eventually lowers its carbon footprint because of these credits well that won't be incredible or truthful claim by Disney.

9211,"Hold the hyperloop. Yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Mosque released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube. Usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward Because there's no traditional friction sources like irresistence or rolling friction that would push back against the pot Able to move an incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name, however, the general concept behind hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870's was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived however only stretchy one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 mph. Well Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow over a 21st century name he wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself Likely to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper. Digging the wreck was it tunnels by his boring company It would take another billionaire industrialist to dabble some space flight No, wait, not that one. Yeah, that's the one After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company hyperloop one it would be renamed to virgin hyperloop Has been trying to do as a company Ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years not the next 20 years.

Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technology, right? So, this idea that because the smartphone existed, Uber could exist, And that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses. But those people that have the ability that afforded to the stick it out to see the game changing platform here those are the people that were looking for and since we've done that passenger test there has been a lot of interest that's really oh this is a lot sooner than I thought.

It takes a lot of polluting and inefficient truck horrige off the roads That it's so means roads gain extra capacity. Hyperloops will still need to use electricity to both move pods and maintain the near vacuum environment and the tube. Performance of the technology believe that this could be done by using renewable sources including a combination of solar panels and battery technology that could be used along the hyper loop itself.

Hydrogen is used in the chemicals industry to produce petroleum products. It's also starting to be used in steel production and industry under a lot of pressure to decarbonize.

President Biden's approval ratings have been improving from his lowest point this past summer but some are still concerned about his handling of the economy.

9257,"Barely the markets are not happy with the higher inflation numbers And I think that's a big factor of when you have higher inflation you're gonna expect higher interest rates and the fed is next week like they increase interest rates by 75 basis points there's somebody think it could be 100 basis points but I doubt that that That that would happen. That would probably really hurt the market. She much more because that would show the fed is much more nervous about inflation than it has said it is although it has said it's it's worry but I think 100 basis points will be much more than their guidance has been. So if they were to do 100 basis points and mark it Shut off in my view. So many vibracious points and markets are already assuming that's going to happen. So, probably not a big surprise to the market. I think the the news from FedEx that you restalking about probably is gonna scare people early tomorrow Someone FedEx is cancelling its guidance that might mean that other companies are gonna follow shoot and that might mean earnings are gonna be less than people expect. So, I can markets are gonna be choppy for a while. There's no doubt about it. Well, and FedEx shares right now down about 11%. Choppy but you still think there are opportunities especially when we see the equity side of the markets, David. Sell off that that is a time Enter. You stand by that.

Anybody that's looking for the top of the market or the bottom of the market, generally, it's gonna fools errand. So, markets are shares her off now at more than 20% from the peak. And I'd pretty good down side. It could go down a little bit more, but I don't see another 20% down. Like the markets are pretty much near the bottom.

He likes to tell you what he's going to do and he invites her then do it. He's pretty much sad. I'm gonna go the fed's gonna FOMC is gonna go up by 75 basis points. I think if they were gonna go 100 bases points or more I think they would have tipped the markets a bit because as I said earlier 100 basis points or more now would shock the markets and I think it would be something that would see a big sell off in stock so I I don't see that being tipped from the fed and obviously he doesn't control what the evil item she does but he Normish Road of influence. So, I suspect we'll be something around 75 basis points. The real change is whether we will have another 50 basis points increase remainder of the year which is what the markets I mean have assumed or could it be in the case that we get more than 50 basis points. Are the remainder of the year? And then of course, right now, the markets are generally assuming probably not Any real increases early next year and who knows I could change but right now I think we're the markets really want some good inflation numbers the next time some inflation numbers come out hopefully they're better than the ones we just saw. Do you find it okay and we promise we'll get to you but is it wacky that we have such a strong labor market and yet David, you know.

As they go through this this legal process and I I saw a great post by illegal analyst. A few weeks ago and I wish I could remember the person's name and reference them but they said, you know, the Delaware court there, the chance to court is less likely to try and force a deal to close because then if the parties don't actually close the deal, it really damages the reputation. I mean, integrity of the court And that there's a case to be made that mosque would just simply say no I'm not closing. You know do what you want. Give me a fine of a one 1 billion dollars. I don't care. I'm not closing the merger on these terms And so it's legal analyst pointed out but it's unlikely that they'll close the deal on those the court will try and force the deal and I think on the other side he saw value in the community he saw value in the user base he saw value in the social network and I'm sure he still does and you know regardless of what he's identified with To the bot problem and stand problem as he calls it that there must still be value there.

And so with that we wanted to have you know a cruise selection process that could make space available to everyday people Hey Facebook Is only the first step for space tourism. The next challenge is what to do and where to stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024 there are two 1 billion dollars project called act station will become the first free flying private international space station. For to use a more consumer friendly term. What space hotel? Actually wasn't the only company out to make your space stay a little more comfortable. Igloo aerospace has been building what they call expandable habitat technology. Like there are B 330 uninflatable pod module that expands once in orbit. Wanna attach to national space station right now they've been testing it and you take it up and it's rather small and then you inflate it and it seems to be working very very well this is likely to be the first kind of Hotel that you're gonna see up in space.

So, what happens if something happens in the oxygen depletes? Who gets the oxygen first? And then, of course, let's not even think about the labor. How do you treat your labor in a space hotel where that person it may be there for 2 or 3 years without coming To earth. So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth. Our space hotels I think they garner a lot of headlines and a lot of news But at the same time that's not the first thing that you're gonna see happen They don't offer the compelling business case I think that you'll see from a place that wants to manufacture pharmaceuticals or a new type of crystal or Type of filament or fiber optic cables and and other things that you can do at microgravity The things that are actually You know, I high value Finished good when you get that back to earth and you sell it for a very very huge profit margin. That's what's likely to happen in space as opposed to having AA real estate platform that you sell to a tourist by Space Hotel.

You open the toy and you see a toy pop out and kids just got excited seeing it piece by piece. Yeah, He's in a bathroom wearing a he's eating a lobster.

But the thing that sets aloe surprise apart is that it manly focused on YouTube. I'm not putting ads on YouTube but working with creators and and influencers to get their products in their hands of these kids doing the unboxing videos for MGA actually the the move towards YouTube was was kind of a bit lucky and almost out of necessity in late 2015 Nickelodeon parent company via com with sue MGA for breach of contract after it fail Pay $three. 5 million for the production of a TV series based on their La La Lupsi dolls To flex their muscle David well if you don't agree to our Thing please in the conflict that we had except the conflict.

In 2020 alone, two people labs estimated that LOL related content Had a mask five. 1 billion views This idea of imitation. So, when you see kids playing with product, it kind of excites the same neuroms in your brain that happen when you do it yourself. The more we could show children having this experience, the more kids Criticism of this whole influencer movement among kids is that kids are young. They don't understand what's An advertisement versus real content That's a big criticism of this industry. Is that a lot of kids are getting on YouTube, a young ages, not being supervised by their parents, and just watching this videos, and they don't realize that maybe that influencers getting paid by the brand, do that video, or there's some other compensation and that, you know, blurs the lines for kids.

The As Airbnb grew like way too big for them to be able to take all these calls alone they developed a team of 100 highly specialized agents that handle the worst of the worst cases over the course of my reporting I've talked to almost 50 former employees at Edia BNB and you know seven Of those work directly on this elite unit.

But inside the company internally they also launched an investigation they wanted to know How did the alleged rapist get the keys how did he get inside that he'd BMB And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner bodega And created you know a problem of liability for your BNB. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. Sophia Airbnb they also you know they wanted to know what was gonna be said in court they wanted to know if any media were gonna pick up on the story And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. Later the alleged rapist was indicted and the supreme court in New York and Airbnb sent a staff member to find out if the company was gonna be mentioned in any of the court records And it wasn't. It wasn't mentioned in the police report. It wasn't mentioned by prosecutors. There's no mention of Airbnb really in any public record. This case has never been reported until now. And you know for Airbnb that was kind of lucky this case never landed in the media You know 18 months later when this woman's lawyer reached out to the company They signed a settlement for seven 1 million dollars.

You know when we started designing our Mars habits at Marsha I think we looked at everything that had been done already and kind of tossed that aside. But what we were given was a set of guidelines from Nasa. They think the best way to build a habitat on Utilization so use the materials that are there if you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the realities to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be You will never be able to build in the first place. So, the idea is to send a 3d printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. Made from recycled plastic all plants like corn and sugarcane and bass salt a rock found on Mars and Earth That gives us it's incredible strength we've tested this material it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity Prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete is not very good at.
