Soon, I just told me that googlers will have this option Literally forever. Obviously you're embracing this massive cultural shift but what are the risks you know what are you worry about So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time not do the commute be able to deal with everything else in their life and coming into the office so the risk is I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the Formal coaching being part brought into meetings all of the touch points that you have and so I think that one of the most important things for all of us is leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead.

So, the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so, you know, there was, that was really clear during the financial crisis. The financial crisis was about liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been Easy 6 to 12 months prior to build in durable equity. You couldn't do it in the moment.

What does this mean Going forward for the institution to have this big change after what's been most of our lifetimes only Queen Elizabeth is what we know what does it mean for the future of the monarchy? Well I think you're right and it's very good to reflect on the idea that Monarch define errors and as we know that throughout British history it certainly we've had the first Elizabeth and era that the Jackabeean area era the Georgians the Victorians et cetera so I think we'll have to wait a while to see really what the history says but the second Elizabeth Has been A time of of regrowth and recapping of the British monarchy and I I think that no one will be able to fault others with the second for the way she handled it and as I said before I think the legacy of the commonwealth will be Strong.

And And I think it will only continue to be in that direction We are we are living in a world a very volatile geopolitics of course something Queen Elizabeth saw through her lifetime from World War two the fall of the Berlin Wall and of course now the invasion of Ukraine what role can a monarch if at all play in terms Of comforting a people or guiding us through these difficult times I guess there's something to say certainly about sincerity. And One of the positives of of a system of monarchy is that because they're not elected officials there's never really that much of a sense that they're simply doing the handshaking or the the hugging To get elected and so in in that sense it offers a sense of comfort For people but also perhaps we're world leaders around the world and that they know that although of course monarchy is a performance and has always been a performance They know that it doesn't have more of an alterier motive In in terms of being elected or being a politician.

I think the excession council ceremony will be very similar Well he's likely to be different will be the new king's coronation I think it will be a much smaller event than the massive carnation that Queen Elizabeth had in 1953 Which if you like was almost the last Harrah of Empire When Britain had very large armed horses but armed horses Tim from all over the Commonwealth countries as well to line the route And it was AA huge event with a very very big audience in Western Stravi which took over a year in terms of planning. My guess is that I can tell this coronation will happen sooner than that. And that it will be a more slim dine event. Compared with 1953.

It was very dear to her that it stayed a union and that's something that King Charles will be perhaps less His views on that and he has been more activist in politics over the years. He may be tempted to step in there in a more overt way than cheers. But the bit more broadly he does need to sort of signal but unto him the UK still remains viable force. The Monarchy is still relevant not just in England and in London where we are today. Further afield. He's got some work to do there.

I'm one of the the big things that we're trying to, of course, explain also to international audience is what this means for the commonwealth.

And I think what we wanted to do by having this academy named was captured the fact. You're not gonna have a patron of institution for 70 years very often. It was absolutely remarkable. To be able to have to connect to that way. But also to to be able to track some of the brightest, most driven change makers around the world to come and spend some time.

It's pushed himself back into the And several films has pushed himself back into the middle and he is he is now a more Figured that he was then I'd but the interesting point is this is that That determines a monic Is that old to the Harold McMillan thing about events dear boy events you know the it's what You could have guessed what was gonna happen to Elizabeth nobody can guess what's gonna happen to Charles we know he faces some things like the possibility of Scotland Here the Bloomberg Country stands out Clearance.

In 1994 stargazers watched as comet shoemake 11 nine hit Jupiter. The resulting zone of chaos was estimated to be as large as the earth. In the event became its turning point in the search for asteroids and comets in our solar system. In 1998 Congress task Nasa with finding 90% of asteroids and comets one km wide or larger. Soon after Hollywood blockbusters Armageddon and deep impact brought attention and fear to the masses The great news is that the vast majority more than 90% of all really large one km near earth objects have been found. The challenge now is working down to these smaller sizes that are Quite capable causing a lot of damage but they're just harder to spot because they're faintered. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system?

That we did find is that our neural network was able to go and identify a handful of asteroids which weren't considered potentially hazardous that when we went into the gradient and foreign time they came Quite close to earth. Which we're not detected before or not considered being dangerous before her meeting they are potentially dangerous it's very hard to send you a And they're going forward in time and asteroid that's gonna hit earth What the earth is really small And what space is really big and then you have to have very exact parameters to shoot an asteroid that goes and hits exactly earth. Not even trying to do that and just launching the asteroids from her surface Integrating backwards in time. It's very hard to make it hit. So you need a lot of calculations which all end up in nothing. And the idea was then, like, well, let's all do that. This is basically what Nasa is doing. Now, it's taking an asteroid, making multiple copies of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbits And I see what frection sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And that they call it the potential impactor. So you calculate a shoulder system forward in time for let's say a 1000 years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface You calculate them backwards to today And then you get your orbital parameters Of today's astro to which you know will land on the planet.

But that may not be enough NASA wants more resources to map our solar system and better technology. We need to ramp up our networking sensors and also we need to just continue to strengthen our our network of international observers so that we can get follow up because we find these objects when Tributed all over the night sky. Once we get more observations, we get better data. We can make better predictions If you look at the big impacts we have had in the last let's say 20 years or maybe 30 years or 50 years Most of them we haven't seen coming so the danger the real danger are saying comes from your church we don't know about and not from your place we do know about This particular natural disaster like a lot of natural disasters and like climate change is a problem with the global comments.

So Rob Parcy was tasked with investigating Carlo Scone and he he was told get to the heart of the man or find out what Carlo Stone did wrong and bring it to our shareholders Yeah it's really complicated because you had Things coming out of the weeds 2018 investigation has has started and we become Aware of matters in terms of conflicts actions by certain individuals That cause some concern because things might not Be what they seem So, in our story, we really took a close look at horinatta in his role in Carlos Gone's downfall.

They've gotta do it very carefully because if they don't do it carefully they're gonna get convicted of criminal activities Likewise A team of lawyers will commission to go to Lebanon. I mean one of my immediate concerns was why are lawyers from Nissan being sent to go to Lebanon to retrieve evidence? These are just lawyers that corporate lawyers from Nissan. Revelations that a number of executives had benefited From share appreciation rights Substantive amounts of money being taken by these guys when they weren't entitled to take them. And you do think yes. Who's this code to look later on?

You know, they are committed to selling oil at these prices and the prices Cheaper at the end of the day. Now, once it gets to kinda 1:32 PM, that's when things start to get really Suddenly there's a kind of influx of of buyers and sellers you know desperation increases in the market and trading volumes go up now 2:08 PM: exactly something bizarre and unprecedented happened Is the oil passes into negative territory and it fell to a record level of minus $38. We've never seen anything like it period in terms of the contraction of the global economy. Huge golf between what they were buying the all for what they were selling it for unable them to make more money than they ever thought possible Was the difference between Minus 37 and all of these positive numbers on every contract they sold. The price of crude briefly hit minus $37 a barrel for one group of traders operating from a small office. It was a very very profitable day. It's important to remember this this had never happened before in the history of all trade. No one could have predicted it. I can't think of another example of where Interest rate or you get paid on both side. You get paid both to sell antibiotic. You know it's unthinkable.

What I love about these stories is there's a real variance of opinion and some people will look at what happened and think that must be dodgy. They all traded at the end of the day.

They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge Driven And firms and oil giants that have got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geezers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream.

I wrote the story about how the one 1 billion dollars market for carbon offsets is setting back the fight against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who who been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trexler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Krexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project In 1988 In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties so to speak of greenhouse gases sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases Atmosphere it can be anywhere in the planet in 7 days. And therefore, you know, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory for example, then, why not pay Off setting Emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements such as the Keoto protocol which mandated the wealthiest ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,883,2022-09-09 17:01:24

I consume electricity. Footprints but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Ridges and that's a plot of land most of the land is actually about 3 hour drive outside of Philadelphia Interestingly this land 3000 of these acres was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990's. This land was immediately threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So, they they do what they they've done so well for all of these years which is they go out. They raise money from local plantherists and they go buy this land to From developers and loggers. And at the time according to an archive version of the nature conservancy's website They when they were proudly announcing this deal they said these threats have been abated because of Fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project And if you look through it this land is a key part of that carbon project And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,884,2022-09-09 17:05:41

So, there's this this balance going on where the registries want rules that attract projects but they don't want it to be so strict where it will Disincentivize projects from getting listed One of the the challenges with with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent, you have policy makers but you know, the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the with the To really participate hard make a lot of things happen Both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost, offsets, and a lot of the because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere so to speak nobody's really representing the climate.

7233,"Endurance of some cross between a spaceship and a monogram But lately the hyperloop is becoming much more real. Yes. It was surreal to be even sitting inside a hyperloop and just even more incredible to actually be like riding down a track in something that was nothing more than I crazy idea 6 years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers, speeds of over 1000 km per hour. But for many, speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation. Fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the high balloon world. It's the network effects that really deliver the benefit. And that opens up a completely different scale of economic We've got plans Wouldn't reveal some boats. We're getting around earth. What if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it. Name for it which is called the hyperloop. Hyperloop. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperwoop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,886,2022-09-09 17:14:27

It's about 500 yards or so Came to a stop Lasting only about 20 seconds and covering only a quarter of a mile at just over 100 mph is a long way away from a true functioning hyperloop. But as for optics it's a crucial step for the future funding. And the number one question we got from investors are from project proponents or just people in general was like is a hyperloop safe? In what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it. But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology. There's no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because you know, it's faster than driving and most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before they've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperlip could be safe with two normal people not astronauts not adrenaline junkies or or test pilots or anything like that. Too normal people getting on a high lube and then most importantly this two people getting off. But Beyonce concerns constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to the estimated tune of around 60 1 million US dollars per kilometer of track so a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles for example is likely to come with a price tag over 10 1 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing.

Liverpool to Manchester is 5 or 6 minute journey Manchester to leads is also a 5 or 6 minute journey What effectively does is create a single super city economy In this vision, the hyperloop acts a little more like a highway. We're pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning, you can travel on a hyperloop network from say Liverpool to leads while the pod behind you, travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro hyper loop network is connected to other networks from the same location you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop For business For leisure that is utterly transformational For high value freight and logistics it's equally transformation But critically If you do a hyperloop network at scale.

Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even moderate magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another and this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity And in the end the usefulness of the real network Because the moment that a track is switching that means that a that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it so you need a lot of space between drinks Because you have no moving components in the track. All the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have your vehicles moving emerging in and out of the network very much like a highway.

Six km test track and the company hopes to test travel speeds there and up to Kilometers per hour. Virgin hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route With projects in various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.

7244,"Fits into that but what are the advantages two hydrogen over other renewables and then what are the drawbacks? Yeah main advantage is the fact that hydrogen can serve rolls that electron struggle with and that's things like seasonal storage Branston's or just anything where you need to store ability where the laptops are harder to store, hydrogen, is gonna be easier. That also leads to a downside though because hydrogen is less energy dense than the usual things that we use for storeable energy today like coal or oil or natural gas. So, you will need more volume of storage to handle the same amount of energy Let's talk about the viability as well and how it may differ in different geographies. What is your view on that? Yeah. So, for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, Places with the best renewable resources things like Latin America or the Middle East even Southern Europe have really really good potential for producing hydrogen And then when you're looking at blue hydrogen which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon caption storage. We do see that becoming more expensive than green hydrogen in the future. Especially as renewable electric Come down. To Russia where you've got good geological storage for the carbon as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap. Alright, great breakdown. Thank you so much to our Meredith Annex. Our Bloomberg, NEF, hydrogen specialist, and of course, you can get From the Bloomberg NEF team on the terminal and online and they've recently done a podcast called hydrogen 101 as part of it switched on series.

7245,For continuing to remove monetary support and fed governor Chris Waller was saying he favors another significant increase The market's expecting a number 75 basis point rate hike later this month so the next question becomes will the fed over tighten then be forced to cut rates early next year Well the former head of the New York Fed Bill Dudley was saying that's premature my views at the S a very premature thing to worry about at this point I mean look at the federal funds right in the United States it's still at 233%. You know well but well below what you consider to be neutral in this current inflation environment so let's get to a tight modre polic Ultimately trying to be. Today the Bloomberg dollar spot index is down about six tenths of one% and that in turn has helped to boost sentiment in the equity market we've got the S and P higher by one and a half percent down industrial average up one.

Well, I'm gonna be a little bit of a Debbie Downer here on ice. Someone's gotta be right a little bit. Usually, they're happy guy, but we also have just met in With us and anyone who read justice column this morning might not be so excited about a one% plus move in the SP 500 just tell tell us about that why is this something to maybe look at sideways In especially last year in at certain points this year there's always that chatter about buying the dip and looking about what's happening with retail traders versus institutional but I thought this was interesting and I was pulling some data for bespoke investment group and it struck me because they were talking about how the S and P five hundreds performance this year following daily moves of at least one% Other direction. Has resulted in the worst next day performance on record. So, that's counter to say what happened last year which was actually the best buy the dip year. Since the 1960's, which is a pretty astounding. So, basically, what they're trying to argue is any type of moves if whether or the S and P five hundred's up more than at one% or down more than one% moves this You're just not seeing people coming in that next day to try to buy any sort of dips there and so that's also when you're trying to figure out, okay, well, which type of investors are doing this because you you are also looking at Wall St Pros.

The Nasdaq though really blowing things out of the water up by two% right now. Really year to hear what Amy Kong Amy joins us this afternoon on the phone from New York City. Amy, how are you? I am well thank you it's good to have you with us should investors trust this rally Hey Three question I think the answer is probably decautious You know, at the end of the day, yes, this is a rally A 3 week losing streak, quite frankly. But ultimately, what we're watching for is the direction from the Fed. We've heard from Powell this week, and the message is very clear, very consistent with what we heard in Jackson Hall as well. They are not yet done with their plans to increase interest rate. They are not yet done too. Fight inflation.

7271,"This inflationary environment Historically speaking, the answer is yes. When we look back at decades of stock market history, to your point, the market tends to not reward them, you know, stop prices from key perspective, and the PE stands. It's inflation starts to run higher than four%. For the longest, we've had In between, you know, oh and three% let's call it and with that in mind, market participants were willing to award a PE ratio north of, you know, 19 times and 20 times. This situation today is very different. You know, certainly, we've got PI at April. Down to between let's say three and six% depending on where it lands I think his story tells us that markets participants won't reward a PE ratio you know north of 18 or 19 times So at what point are you going to look at the CPI number and Amy and and say that okay I'm convinced that inflation is actually coming down what the fed has been trying to do over the last few months is actually working what number does that have to be? The great question you know a lot of investors out there including us we we question you know whether or not the Fed has to even change its target it's long term target of two% that's obviously a much broader question I I'm not in position to answer I would say Somewhere in the tune between that three and six% I think would be a reasonable area over the next couple of quarter ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,924,2022-09-09 20:00:44

I think it was like Tuesday in kids getting back for us for hosting ladies day in now we're outnumbered with crazy thoughts from today. Well, speaking of peaks, I'm gonna go out on a limb and risk getting mocked by romaine and and take a peek at the charts because That really I think is encouraging about this game. We've seen this week like all year we've seen really nasty drops in the S and P 500 that a rebound that looks like a bear market rebound then another drop and they attended to set lower lows each time. This time we've actually set a lower or a higher low. Yeah. With this latest drop down so no romaine something that the chart watchers I think we'll well we came into this week of course with a lot of bear A lot of interesting notes here about the potential that some of the balances we've been seeing are a little bit of a false move and maybe we are headed for a prolonged bear market at least for today that doesn't seem to be the case with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing higher by about 377 points up a percent the S and P 500 higher by about one. Five% and closing for the second day above 4000 The Nasdaq composite higher by 250 points or two% and the Russell 2000 also participating here on the day up about 36 points or two% here on the day.

Whether or not that was actually people taking profits at the moment because dollar has been on a 10 not just on the week but on the month on the year. We're currently seeing dollar index off 10% so it actually treats lower through the course of the week on the back of that. What rises higher this was Frank actually strengthening more than a percentage point. The Aussie dollar as we start to see maybe little bit more risk on sentiment even though China still looks pretty poor in terms of economic growth. The Aussie gets higher. Norwegian crown actually manages And strengthen more than a percentage point. Why? Because oil traded higher. Now, we still down on the week but it managed to call back some of those losses. We're UTI crewed up three% rent crew up three. Six% as well natural gas also managing to call back some of the original losses as we see maybe less of a supply issue than we had on more of a supply issue that we thought and therefore maybe a little bit push higher in the side surprise side I'm looking at iron or getting a beard is really it felt like a Trade across commodities, across effects, and then you look at bonds.

It's becoming AA private enterprise Still very high risk with the higher war potential reward But you know, government is really out of the business of of flying people now and it's it's really gonna be company. It's like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson that that do that heavy Commercial space tourism is usually about taking the non-astronaut the private citizen into an orbital or suborbital flight so you get a short amount of microgravity experience and you can float and take some photos and then you come back This was something that technology had gotten to a point where the private sector was going to make a business out of this.

Every government related to that because the way and the outer space treating the outer space regime have set this up is that anything that happens in space first has to go through a diplomatic channel before you think about sewing in a quarter block and so every single slip and fall in a in a space hotel is a diplomatic Bear.

But inside the company internally they also launched an investigation they wanted to know How did the alleged rapist get the keys how did he get inside that he'll be And when they found out that the keys had been left at the corner bodega Then created you know a problem of liability for your BMB. They didn't have a policy around key exchange. They didn't tell their hosts how they did or didn't have to hand keys over to guests as they were arriving. So for your BMB they also you know they wanted to know what was gonna be said in court they wanted to know if any media were gonna pick up on this story And they wanted to know what the illegal liability potentially could be. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1030,2022-09-09 23:22:20

Airbnb's business model is based on strangers trusting one another. We often hear from the founders and the chief executive himself saying trust is their number one priority. I've actually heard Brian Cheski, the chief executive of Airbnb, talking about how he didn't build a website or a platform that allows people to stay There's homes what he built was a community that trusts one another And when that premise is undercut Airbnb's entire business model is under threat.

Opening the international space station to commercial opportunities Marketing these opportunities as we've never done before. Managing and maintaining me, I assess cost $three. 4 billion a year. That's over half Nasa's space operations budget Aging hardware and space debris will only add to these costs which is why Nasa is now hoping to pass some responsibility for the station over to commercial companies Like to see a robust commercial marketplace in lower Thor but we're space stations exist outside of Nasa the goal being That Nasa could be a customer and we wanna have numerous providers that are competing against each other on cost and innovation.

It really is about The thought process and the cost So that anybody that wants to take advantage of our place in orbit and a microgravity environment can do so and that's really it. I need to go towards my feet. Fantastic vehicle but one of the big things is they have a quite a few Components outside You have to do an EBA as face walk to go fix it a space walk on a good day is 100 hours of crude time to get ready and actually go do the the space watch that we're able to take advantage of the reduce size of components and so our design is gonna have all of the components here are gonna be in the pressurized environment So, we know what the basics are. You know, water food Clothing life support and we know how to handle those but now the next step is how do we make it more intuitive and we want to now take advantage of the technology The capabilities have the day to build more luxury into the experience. The objective is to make the environment the background for all the users. Your everyday doing whatever you wanna do on orbit, research, manufacturing, looking out the window, whatever you're there to do. We want you to be able to do that not even think about the environment and it's because of our experience We're able to build that environment. You won't worry about that.

7321,"Planet has opened up a longer term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets Working in a firm designing skyscrapers and you know I saw Elon and he landed his falcon X rock in the middle of the ocean and that for me was a trigger I thought wow this could actually happen and it's always been my dream to put a building on the moon or Mars If he's going out the piece he's going it could definitely happen within my lifetime and I wanna be the one to build it. In this warehouse alongside startups from across the US architecture firm AI space factory are refining the production of Marsha. A full story structure they created for a Nasa competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars. They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call institution Sci fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be Expensive. You would never be able to build in the first place. So, the idea is to send the threeD printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. The reusable print material is a mix of biopolymer made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugarcane and bath salt a rock ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1034,2022-09-09 23:39:43
7322,"And if we want to keep that up What do habitats need to look like? And frankly, they can be larger, they can be small, but the future of space habitats really to me comes down to the ability to persistently maintain human presence. Whether that's a few people or many people, that seems to be the dividing line between where we were before and where we wanna In the future. At the very deepest level is about survival or species so I get pretty excited when I spend a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do Is this really is the first step to learning to live live off the planet. That first step is just to start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping into imagine what these new space habitats look like is what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialization. On the next episode of Giant Leap we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on earth Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to threeD print full human organs But the four lowers will be can become a new industrial center we're going to need to take another giant leap ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1035,2022-09-09 23:44:03

And now, having been stuck at home for over a year, the same generation that embraced Uber's Airbnb's want something to call their own. I got married and i have a child so you know looking for more space and thought about the conventional route of young and single living the city and then move out to the suburbs we have a kid in a wife I've seen a whole bunch of my friends just move on down to the West Palm Beach Miami area Austin Texas so they are certainly moving out of the city but space was top of mind for the moving out We live in Williamsburg for about 16 plus years and week two in the pandemic we just realized we needed more so we started looking for a house right away Now living Goshen New York which is about an hour and a half from New York City. Instagram accounts like Circa Houses in cheap old houses offer a glimpse into the perfect suburban life often at a price point not too dissimilar to what adults pay for rent in major cities by the end of 2020 New Yorkers who didn't flee paid an average of $2700 a month for an apartment even as rent prices plummeted during the Emic.

I'd say that the buyer is much more involved these days. Selling is creating brand new ways to shop. So, let's look at vintage clothing for example. There are sellers on Instagram finding successful ways to sell one of a kind items. It's that fleeting nature, the effemeral nature of social media. You post the item online and whoever's first gets that one of a kind item. Real estate has similar scarcity to it. There's a one place to buy. It's one home, one apartment, one one thing. It's one of a kind. But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification researcher Andre Perry who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent. Is a the primary source to get news and information but it's not just about social media it's about the movement that we're in the racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment and so people not only are getting information about what protects In the long run from economic shocks things like wealth.

That's gonna be lived in and also working as a as an investment. A lot of this is points to Millennials can utilize and and leverage social media to their benefit but it also speaks to again this moment that folks want freedom. So, millennials are really stepping up to this real estate game and and taking ownership and building well Of course not everything is as it seems online while social media can be a useful tool for learning there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter We kind of thought if we buy it at 450 we could put two 300 1000 into the house and really make it ours and our own Wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built-in deep fryer which was Not in the listing photos. We kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely utteristic. Do we have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram? They say, I love it.
