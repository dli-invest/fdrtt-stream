They made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show, The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. UFC under Dana White had a gift for weaving compelling personal narratives and rivalry people throwing shoes a guy coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash.

When you write about allegations against companies in particularly about lawsuits against companies Companies Don't wanna say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them.

That they want to fight it and they want to defeat it. The fighters I talked to describe having side jobs Reliant on UFC in part because Taxes and expenses they weren't making enough money to feel financially secure From a financial Is you know something I've had a challenge in admitting I could tell you now that I lived in my mom's Natash garage the entire time I was fighting and I had a second job is about turn a bartender a third job as a personal trainer just to make ends meet Nate Quari told me that over his time in UFC he fought fights while he was tens of thousands of dollars in debt coming into the fight ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2091,2022-09-13 00:12:56

So, the risk is I think about my career and so much of the benefit in my career was the informal coaching, being part brought into meetings, all of the touch points that you have and so, I think that one of the most important things All of us is leaders is we need to evolve the way we lead.

It's really important for those of us in certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues.

8393,Rather than subsiding and they recognize the markets were not helping Of tightening financial conditions and helping them do some of the heavy lifting in in lowering demand in order to try lower inflation. England's communication has been much more inconsistent between various members of the committee and they've been much more timid in some of the steps they've taken to raise interest rates Largely because of the growth outlook and I think that from my perspective the bank has over weighted the growth outlook in their reaction function which when inflation is either side of two% it isn't is understandable One inflation is 10% 12% or forecast to go to go much higher I don't think you can afford to do so I don't think stable prices inflation mandate such as the bank has Amidst them really to do so the lesson that we learnt from the 70s the reason that we have inflation targeting so central and central back mandates is that when inflation Self-fulfilling regardless of the causes because there were huge supply trucks in the 70s as well regardless of the causes when inflation comes south of filling that is the number one priority because it's a bit of an economic wrecking ball And I just think that there's been too much foot dragging to this point.

The country consumes about a quarter of the world's energy supply 35% more than the US annually. It's energy needs of more than triple since the year 2000. That consumption has helped to feel astonishing growth. But it's come at a cost. There is no way to tackle climate change unless China reduces its emissions to 19. The countries reliance on fossil fuels is also a hindrance to its own growth and the well being of its citizens. It has a long standing pollution problem and it is also prone to outages that severely hump All this has led the world's biggest polluter to take steps towards a radical transformation. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2170,2022-09-13 05:58:30

It's about how sticky it is. We have a deep Problem that centre banks are still only getting up to grips with which means financial conditions are gonna continue to tighten which means equities are more downside in the year ahead and on top of that Danny is the other dynamic you've just mentioned is the fact that the cost of living crisis means the consumer is gonna be increasingly squeezed and we haven't really felt that impact yet because Started this year the consumer had never been so wealthy now suddenly they're starting to feel that squeeze and they're getting rights to squeeze their lending as well. Yep peak inflation doesn't necessarily mean peak hawkish knits hawkishness okay so if it's not exhaustion that turns the narrative around in terms Turn it around what sort of environment do we need to get into that finally we can say the dollar has run out of steam. Yeah so Daniel I wrote this piece this morning saying it's not exhaustional turn the trend because this is not a dollar trend that's been based on momentum it's the positioning is not very stretched in the dollar that's Important to emphasize even in currencies like the euro and sterling what has been such negativity. There's not extreme positioning at all. So this is not a move based in the fact that everyone is bullish and No one else can buy. That is not the case at all. So therefore, this will only turn when we get capitulation. When we get people really just kind of resigned, they cannot fight this trade. And they just keep on going with it.

Where does that leave us into in terms of the the need for these for these big wall street banks in the banks here in Europe as well to trim some of these costs? I think that's a great And I've been thinking about it all morning because if you look at what's happening in Goldman, Texas, it's a very different story from HSBC. For HSBC, they're cutting costs. They are, you know, keeping a handle on head count and that could result in brutal cuts but when you're looking at what's happening at Golden Sax, it's really just a return of the calling that we have seen in prior years. So, if you Can be very big and that is not what we're seeing right now. So, while the cuts can be painful, Tom, it is the truth that it's not very steep yet and it's Competitiveness and headcount control at a time where they're still growing, whereas HSBC, and a lot of the European banks here. You are seeing them cut not by the 100 Potentially the thousands and that's also what we're seeing over a credit sweep potentially this year and investors are rewarding some of these plans because again they wanna see that return of capital to them and that that clamped down on cost set a time when profitability is also under pressure.

We all hope for a soft landing. Certainly, I would hope that's what the economy can achieve. There's a possibility of achieving that. You're gonna hear Officials that emphasize that possibility but it is that it is a possibility. It is not a high probability. It's a possible outcoming outcome that we hope for.

I think that would be quite an accomplishment if the Fed was able to return inflation which would still be above Target but you know, at least a closer to Target Three%. The issue is that it looks to us that to get there, you will need at least a somewhat significant rise in the unemployment rate.

So, then you have to define what neutral is. Some of them think three and a half, some of Four or a little above.

In 1998 Congress task Nasa with binding 90% of asteroids and comets one km wide or larger. Soon after Hollywood blockbusters armagedon and deep impact brought attention and fear to the masses The great news is that the vast majority more than 90% of all the really large one km near earth objects have been found the challenge now is working down to the smaller sizes that are Quite capable causing a lot of damage but they're just harder to spot because they're fainter. They're smaller. Can you give us a sense of how many are out there in our solar system We know that there are a lot of asteroids in our solar system. They number in the billions. Most of them, however, are between Mars and Jupiter and what we call the main asteroid belt. This is a region of space where most of the Australians in the inner part of our solar system live and they stay there for many billions of years. There's another Though the kind of leaks inward and gets into the region somewhat close to the earth. And we call these near earth objects. We think that there are millions and millions of near our objects that are out there in the total population. As of today, we know of the sort of around 2025, 1000 something like that. When we first spot an object, we we really know very little about it. We just see something moving across Sky. So, all you get is just sort of a handful of snapshots, just enough to be able to tell that this isn't an asteroid that we've already seen before. And then once we can calculate the distance to it, we can now start to make predictions about it. Is it large or is it small ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2288,2022-09-13 14:34:47

This is basically what Nance has doing. Now, it's taking an asteroid, making multiple copy of them, shooting them all for it in time, calculating their orbits And then see what fresh and sort of gets close to earth. They'll even hitting earth but getting close to earth. And then they call it the potential infector So you calculate the shoulder system forwards in time for let's say a 1000 years and then you launch asteroids from the surface as if they if you go forwards in time would fall on the surface You calculate them backwards to today And then you get your orbital parameters of today's asteroid to which you know will land on the planet. And those you can use as known infectors. Where perhaps telescopes and and other imaging tools can't. Since the observations get more complex The physics gets more complex and if the physics will get more complex, the mathematics becomes more complex and at some point, you can't solve your problems analytically anymore. And then it's where the computer comes in. Now, we have this train neural network. Yes, a way of calculating in a fraction of a seconds. Whether not an estro, this potentially dangers or not and therefore deserves more attention Or or more time to spend on for for really finding out if it is dangerous. When it comes to hunting asteroids time is critical. What we can do about a potentially hazardous object depends a great deal on what we know about it and how much time we have before the encounter We'd really like to find them on their decades away. Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to to move an object decide. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2289,2022-09-13 14:39:02

One of the biggest roadblocks to building infrastructure for the internet here in the United States are the existing large providers. They have their landscaped out.

Comcast released a similar statement encouraging more public private collaboration on this effort.

But it also stipulated that these projects needed to be up and running by December 30. For contractors who plan projects months and years in advance it's a scramble to rearrange their schedules to meet that deadline.

Currently anyone her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the Porter Jaffa in Telavive The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid and our goal going forward is to expand it to all suitable break In the city of Telavil and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today engineer is an entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few 100 kilowatts of wave energy a deployed compared with giggle watts of offshore wind. But the field has come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. I would have a lot more confidence in the success wave energy companies today as opposed to like 20 years ago but in the next few years or maybe the next couple of decades it it will be more likely to be used in remote locations like islands that are otherwise dependent on expensive Or out at sea on gasty commissioning rigs or for parring underwater autonomous vehicles. So definitely wave energy can compete with other renewable energy sources but I personally believe that this is not a competition. In order to have a 100% renewable energy friendly world we need all renewable energy sources to work together ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2310,2022-09-13 16:10:08

8551,Scale of economic opportunity The plans. Wouldn't be awesome boats. We're getting around earth. What if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it. Name for it which is called the hyperloop. Hyperloop. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Mosque released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperwoop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment A hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward because there's no traditional friction sources like irresistence or rolling friction that would push back against the pot. The hyperloop is able to move it incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name however the general concept behind hyperloop is actually pretty old In fact New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870's was based on a similar principle. The pneumatic transit system was short lived however only stretchy one block and topping out at a rather leisurely 10 mph. While Elon would make some 21st century improvements to this concept and bestow over a 21st century name. He wouldn't end up pursuing the technology itself. I'd like you to focus his efforts on something a little bit deeper. Digging the rack was it tunnels by his boring company It would take another billionaire industrialist to dabble some space flight ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2325,2022-09-13 17:15:11

But Beyonce concerns constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to be estimated tune of around 60 1 million US dollars per kilometer of track San Francisco to Los Angeles for example. Is likely to come with a price tag. Over 10 1 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs. Investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing. Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing app Or something to that effect. You know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technologies, right? So, this idea that because the smartphone existed Uber could exist. And that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses But there's people that have the ability that afforded to the stick it out to see the game changing platform here those are the people that were looking for and since we've done that passenger test there has been a lot of interest that's really oh this is a lot sooner than I thought ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2326,2022-09-13 17:19:37

The first of these is blue origin founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos using the autonomous rocket system new shepherd attribute to the first American in space blue origin plans to launch up to six passengers at a time offering a verified treat of 62 mi high views and a momentary experience of weightlessness Booking officially kicked off in May 2021 with the very first C to be auctioned off for charity Richard Branson's virgin galactic has also been pursuing a viable form of suborbital tourism aiming for launch in 2022 once sir richard himself has taken a flight So I've got the whip on the team and we'll see how we go. The company claims to have lined up over 600 seat reservations so far including Justin Bieber and Leonardo DiCaprio. Virgin has projected that the final cost of the ticket will be at least 250 1000 Or roughly $50 thousand for each of the 5 minutes or so of weightlessness that you'll get to experience. Although costly both companies offerings aim to make sub orbital flight a regular form of adventure travel eventually driving down costs at scale to expand the customer base beyond the orbit of celebrities Billionaires.

The next challenge is what to do and where it stay when you get there. Axiom space is planning to launch the first segment of a new commercial space station in 2024.

So a lot of things to think about. Space habitats are more likely in the near future to focus on research missions and be a home for experiments that can't happen as easily back on earth.

8639,Text your phone AI space factory a refining the production of Marsha a four story structure they created for a Nasa competition to design the next generation of space habitats on Mars They think the best way to build a habitat on Mars or the moon is to use what they call institution resource utilization so use the materials that are there If you've seen sci-fi movies you might see like glass and steel domes on distant planets but the reality is to ship that kind of material to the moon of Mars would be So the idea is to send a 3d printing robot which can then harvest the materials you find on a site and build with that. Made from recycled plastic or plants like corn and sugarcane and bath salt a rock Found on Mars and Earth hey it's the rock that gives us it's incredible strength We've tested this material it's three times as strong as concrete in compression and it actually has what we call it a tensile capacity prevent itself from being pulled apart which is something concrete's not very good at you need to think at all times how do you optimize the amount of material that you use and and that's also why this thing is shaped Like an egg and if you think of an egg it's a very structurally optimized form. It's very very thin. I better provide the strength that the egg needs and and that's why this is shaped the way that it is. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2413,2022-09-13 23:40:20
8640,Hey so I get pretty excited when I spin a few moments thinking about what we're off to go do cuz this really is the first step to learning to live live off the planet That first step is just the start of our journey to create a lasting legacy in space. While commercial companies may be stepping into imagine what these new space habitats look like is what's happening inside of them that may unlock the future of space industrialization. On the next episode of giant leap we'll visit the private companies who are looking to build their business around manufacturing in space Using the unique properties of microgravity they plan to create new materials with extraordinary qualities that can't be replicated on earth Including new manufacturing techniques that could change how we build large structures in space and even unlock the ability to threeD print full human organs But before lowerth will a bit can become a new industrial center we're going to need to take another giant leap ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2414,2022-09-13 23:44:40
8641,"You in the pandemic we just realized we needed more so we started looking for a house right away Now living Goshen New York which is about an hour and a half from New York City.

Millennials make a large percentage of spending right now and that makes them a valuable consumer for brands. That means they're being coded by everyone out there to spend with them. They grew up online they're comfortable with pretty much anything that you can do there and that's that's buying things selling things Craig's list eBay all that making $100 purchase on Craigslist or a $1000 purchase on eBay it's not that much of a leap to go even further if you're buying AA fancy piece of jewelry or House for a one 1 million bucks The uptick in home demand fueled by the pandemic combined with record low interest rates has made home buying extremely competitive over the last year so much so that some millennials look to social media to shop and actually buy their first house site unseen. I saw sort of something on my Instagram feed and you know, clicked and we ended up seeing this house. The houses weren't really being shown at that time cuz we were in full lockdown. We became really interested. One YouTube video, 20 Zelo photos. That is it. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2415,2022-09-13 23:49:12
8642,"But the rise in social media real estate isn't just about the instant gratification researcher Andre Perry who studies economic inclusion at the Brookings Institute says social media has evolved from the days of online hangout spaces and mood boards to a powerful change agent Racial justice uprising really gave people a sense of worth and empowerment and so people not only are getting information about what protects In the long run from economic shocks things like wealth. Search Andre found that not only are more millennials buying homes during the pandemic the rate of home ownership among black millennials are at historic highs. The fastest way to accumulate wealth in this country traditionally has been through homeownership. Millennials in particular are saying, hey, I want protection. I wanna live longer. I want my education to go further. Let me acquire wealth in in the best way to do that is through home ownership. When the pandemic hit many of the amenities or the comforts that came along with those living conditions were gone. Folks couldn't go to bars and fancy shops and so you saw instead of people going out and buying clothes, they saved their money ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2416,2022-09-13 23:53:30
8643,Useful tool for learning there's still a lot it can't tell you about the home buying experience or living in the suburbs for that matter we knew going into it by jitting for a lot of renovations we kind of thought if we buy it at 450 we could put two 300 1000 into the house and really make it ours and our Yeah wait to replace in this kitchen and update our built in deep fryer which was Not in the listing photos we kind of got into the house and we realized that budget was completely That we have a lot of people who see our design on Instagram they say I love it can you come build this on my property and then they'll send us a lot which they bought sight unseen during COVID and because of site conditions or zoning it's virtually unbuildable I think we all know that what you see on Instagram and what you see in real life or two very different things so while we can definitely as brokers create these fantastic narratives the one recommendation that I would give is do your homework don't believe everything Say that's not to say that you know there's dishonesty or anything where people are trying to manipulate you but not everything you see is accurate This shift towards social media house hunting may also help to bring equilibrium to a market that has historically disadvantaged specific groups of buyers. Of the traditional ways that people got mortgages or or loans often precluded black people because they they deemed us too risky for those loans with technology there's ways to get around that as long as more black people get educated on racism ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,2417,2022-09-13 23:57:55
