In particularly, a monopoly purchaser of labor. A key argument in this lawsuit has been about as UFC succeeds and it's revenue source how much should we expect Absent illegal conduct The fighters pay would soar as well. In UFC After year the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually paying the workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20% and what does analysis shows through complex statistical regression modeling is that if the UFC Was competitive and did not allegedly violate the any trust laws it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenue is generated just like baseball just like hockey just like basketball If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated The fighters would have made $one. 6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017.

Oceans they cover over 70% of the planet but most of what lies underneath is a mystery The sea floor is a really fascinating landscape. We don't have a lot of data to describe the shape of it in detail. But in places where we do there are spectacular features. There's meandering channels with all kinds of interesting topography. There are canyons. There are sea mounts. In ridges all kinds of things that we see on land that are just basically hidden from us Water. It stands this is what a map of the sea bed looks like or that black those are the parts we haven't mapped yet Most people think that they see floors actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor but most of that is based on prediction roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a computation Gravity. In 2017 the nip on foundation and the general bathroom metric chart of the oceans or jebco launched sea bed 2030 It's a collaborative project to collect and collect data ocean wide and create a complete map of the sea floor by the end of the decade ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,184,2022-09-07 00:20:37

Each individual king of sound has many many beams. So, it looks like a giant fan across the sea floor and that fan is moving along the sea floor. So, you have many tiny little beams going across And there are travelling along a track. You can look at that data and look at both the peaks and the valleys and the highs and the lows and sort of create a three dimensional image of the sea floor. The accuracy of multimedia sonar really depends on the water depth that you're in. Think of it like a flashlight beam and if you're holding a flashlight and you're shining it on the floor, the closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a Which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So, it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object This variation in depth means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 m in shallow waters to 800 by 800 m in the deepest parts of the ocean which go down as far as 11 1000 m.

So far just one third of all CPEC projects have been completed in Guada none of them have been and the promised improvements for local people like job creation and better infrastructure have not materialized. So what has China got to gain from developing this seemingly obscure city on the Pakistani coast?

Ok so there's the question of how it rate hikes are going to impact inflation there's also a question as to whether rate hikes can actually support currencies like the pound or the euro in the case of the ECB given the persistence strength of the dollar constant team does anything stand in the way of that? I think it's not a particularly helpful to try to out hike each other for example when it comes to to eight hikes and currencies.

My name is Jeff Mesh. I'm a journalist based in Los Angeles. I wrote the story for Bloomberg Business Week about Pepsi's number fever campaign. The Philippines is a really interesting country. It's made up of thousands of islands. It's also a country that's very heavily influenced by America. Culture is everywhere you look in the Philippines they're obsessed with Frank Sinatra music for example They love all things America and that extends to their their love for soft drinks Pepsi Cola Coca Cola In the 1990's it was everywhere Pepsi and Coca-Cola were in broiled in what is now known as the cola wars. It was a fierce battle for market dominance. Number fever was already a really popular promotion.

Still not certain exactly how many winners there were of lucky 349 bottle caps but we know that Pepsi printed over 600 1000 of them Pepsi realized very early that there was a problem Hundreds of people started arriving at their buckling plants with their lucky bottle caps They realized something was seriously wrong Perhaps he tried to solve the problem by offering a small token donation to anyone that brought a lucky bottle cap to their bottling plan But it wasn't enough.

Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not your objects is dangerous or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroids it may take you know days of computing time on very big machines To determine this this hazardousness the current problem is that there's just too many asteroids out there to us and a huge amount of computational power on all of them So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and Post a hazard to earth.

Because the more time you have, the more options you have. And the less energy it takes to to move an object decide.

This is the urban heat island effect and it accounts for higher temperatures in cities often by several degrees compared with their surroundings. It's becoming a huge risk to human health as growing up in populations exacerbate the heating effects of climate change. Heat waves kill more people than any other extreme weather event more than tornadoes hurricanes and even floods. That's why Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies are being studied in Singapore by a group of researchers. The government back project called calling Singapore is now in the process of combining everything they've learned to create a digital tool that can help cities all over the world Starting would Singapore In Singapore close to the equator temperatures regularly rise above 32Â°C or 90Â°F And the city structures only make it worse. And that is also the keys for Singapore which is basically a concrete jungle more urbanized, more developed city. And even in Singapore what you have is a situation whereby there's a temperature difference of 7Â°C between the more urban eyes and the more rural areas The government has taken drastic steps to keep temperatures down This is Gardens by the Bay an award winning park And inside this greenhouse is a pleasant 24Â° ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,202,2022-09-07 15:28:18

But on the other hand is also to get the people to be more connected to nature.

The sea is very challenging environment within which to operate apart projects so sea water is crazy and conditions about rough so this means that power projects don't have a very long lifetime and it increases operating and maintenance costs. Partly because of that many early wave energy projects hit rough waters such as the palamus wave energy convert it in portugal and the isla limpit project in Scotland. Hasn't stopped others from trying. Companies are focused on testing projects out to see proving that your ability trying to raise And bring down cost the sector hasn't really converged around one single technology design and companies are kind of under side about which design works best.

Carlos Gone was an auto industry leader respected by many in Japan. He's in jail. Of Carl Skohan came completely out of the blue. This was in November of 2018.

He began to suspect that there was a desire even at the highest level within Nissan to kind of sweep these conflicts of interest under the rug.

Within 3 days of me submitting that to the board of directors that letter to the independent board of directors I was removed from the Executive conduct matters. Then told that I could not attend board meetings anymore.

They lost money that day. Big banks and brokers who sort of stand in the middle of trading parties. They lost money that day. And another interesting thing is the oil producing countries like Q eight or Canada. They sell oil An average of the WTI closing price over the proceeding month. So the fact that one of those numbers in the average was minus 37. Meant if you can imagine countries like Saudi Arabia and QA. Potentially lost a couple of dollars on every single barrel of all they sold that month.

As we sort of saw and spotted a number of these very aggressive carbon offset projects which appeared to be generating inflated credits or bogus credits We saw a number of them were associated with the nature conservancy. This surprised us. The nature conservancy is the world's biggest environmental group. They have about a one 1 billion dollars a year and revenues. And they've been around for seven decades They've preserved about 125 1 million acres of land They've done so many good works over the years and they've been very strong in terms of working with corporate partners. The nature conservancy is taken a different approach. A very pragmatic and pro business approach. They will not go out and criticize a big polluter.

Nature conservancy and many others see that the carbon credits as a pot of money that they can tap into to further their own benevolent aims but unfortunately what this has resulted in is claims of climate progress that just aren't really happening So the nature conservancy defends vigorously these deals and and they and and others will say look our projects are just following the rules that these registry So someone also put some of the blame on the registries themselves because they're setting up the rules which allow these vapor projects to get up and sold. So we've reached out to all of the companies we mentioned in the story including Disney that didn't want to be interviewed for this story but they all told us that Look we have to rely on the experts out there and those experts they say are these carbon registries that have been set up Most of these nature conservancy deals are set up and sold on this exchanges called the American Carbon Registry. Now it's the old list of these registries Allow voluntary carbon credits to be sold.

Literally digging the requisite tunnels by his boring company It would take another billionaire industrialist to dabble some space flight No, wait, not that one. That's the one. After Richard Branson would make a large investment in the company hyperloop one it would be renamed to virgin hyperloop. Has been trying to do as a company Ultimately it's something that's happening in the next couple of years not the next 20 years. Josh Geigel is the co-founder and CEO of Virgin Hyperloop In a familiar text startup story he seen the project go from a garage to a large scale testing facility outside of Las Vegas Building the first kind of hyperloop system in 2016 we've done a lot of work about 500 tests that we've done on that over the last 5 years What we realized that we need to do is take that technology show that it can be commercial so drive the cost down improve the efficiency approval performance but the key thing is you know is actually making it approachable and safe for individuals. In order to do that Josh along with Virgin's head of passenger experience Sara Lucia bravely volunteered to take the inaugural ride With her and I were realizing it's like we're the first two people sitting in a hype room The only type of people that have gone through this environment or in space it's in there we are in just like normal clothes because of the system the safety of what we designed One And then once we started going you felt a bit of acceleration we accelerated a little bit harder than we wouldn't commercial be like a sports car.

6579,"The ripple effects of what hyperloop could achieve those fairly challenging at this stage of development It's fast, yes, but for point to point travel, traditional mag live trains can move pretty fast as well. And outside of China, South Korea, and Japan, even those haven't seen much adoption elsewhere due to the high costs and questionable profitability. The Shanghai line in China for example loses around 100 1 million dollars every year. Hyperloop companies, however, believe they can offer something different than traditional railway lines. My name is Alan James And as far as I know I'm the only guy on the planet who's written a government level business case for KMH conventional high-speed rail 500 KMHLev and 1000 KMH hyperloop. It's fundamentally about moving people from where they are to where they want to go when they want to make those journeys and doing it in much smaller numbers so pod designs for hyperloop range from 12 to 20 Seats typically Why are they small It's because small enables the network to operate flexibly.

But even with all multipliers of time and carbon emission savings that are hyperloop network may provide the investment capital required to actually build such a network becomes even more economically and politically Committing doesn't mean spending billions on day one Committing means How do we face it One company and another lens is working to develop that technology and perhaps more importantly the international coalition needed to make the hyperloop network a reality. So we are here New Year's first full skill hypothesis Or we can already prove every conceptual technology of the iPhone. This is Tim Howder a co-founder and CEO of Hart Hyper Loop headquartered in the city of Delph. And while this testing tube might not seem as large as others inside is a key technology to create the on and off ramp type infrastructure of a hyperloop network that is a lane switch That's something we can already test here. You can actually see it here. Gonna track his diversity from one track into two the next possible to arrange split up the i could track And it doesn't you can create a complete eyebrow network Travel with a metro In the city. The nice thing about this magnetic levitation system that we've developed Is that there's absolutely oh moving components in the track So for example if you have to do a lane switch ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,229,2022-09-07 17:25:32
6581,In order to help build this coalition of private and public interest in hyperloop development heart in 2018 partner with other hyperlib companies from Europe and Canada the goal was to define established in standardize the framework to regulate hyperlip systems right now Are working with all the hyperloop developers together in setting up the first let's say a structure for the for starting the standards drafting One of the most important goals for heart is interoperability Essentially making sure the different systems can communicate with each other. Interferability is so important because what we want to achieve is actually have this seamless travel experience. So you don't want to end up for example going from Madrid to Paris and then switching because you need to use a different technology Get for example to Amsterdam The idea being that as companies run Europe create the first commercial hyperloop tracks between individual cities 1 day those can all be connected to a larger network Everyone that believes that hyperloop is a future transport system also realizes that there is a need to have this network because that's where a hyperloop thrives. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,230,2022-09-07 17:29:55

Hydrogen gas Htwo burns hot and clean making it an attractive tool in the race to net oh but isolating hydrogen from other elements is no easy task. This releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Another method is used electricity to split water molecules in a process called electrolysis. Although there is no carbon byproduct. A lot of electricity is needed. And if this Comes from burning cold or gas. Power by fossil fuels is called gray hydrogen. If carbon capture is storage is used together with fossil fuels. Then it becomes blue hydrogen. If nuclear power issues, it's called pink. Finally green hydrogen is what is produced by electrolysis and powered from renewable sources. This method is considered emissions free. It's predicted that by the early 2030's Htwo made from renewables will be cheaper than that made from fossil fuels. That hinges on the cost of electrolysis declining which will be achieved through larger projects and an expansion of manufacturing to be clear vast amounts of Htwo are already used today.

So, where are the what place do you think hydrogen is likely to have in the future energy mix globally? Hydrogen this incredible solution for us is we look to decarbonize because it's a perfect solution areas that are hard to electrify. So, where we like to think about hydrogen playing a role, it's in things like heavy industry, especially where you need a feed stalk as well as energy source Transport maybe even shipping an aviation. That sounds great that it can be used for such diverse industries. At the end of the day though, how much is A cost. Well that's the amazing thing about hydrogen because So when we're talking about clean hydrogen we're usually mean green hydrogen produce from renewable electricity And in that case your hydrogen is almost as cheap as the renewables that are used to make it So if you're in a place with really good renewable resources you'll be able to have cheaper hydrogen but even in places with less good resources we think that hydrogen can be cheaper than a dollar per kilogram. Which is the price of unabated hydrogen today and around $eight per one 1 million BTUs for those who prefer to think in Energy units. That can be teach anywhere in the world by 2050 we believe.

How significant do you think these upgrades are and key People gonna buy these new devices with Inflation, higher than, you know, it's been in 40 years. I think it's been interesting to see that the Yesterday has been on real pain points but consumer have and also hit on the key drivers that you see consumer talk more and more about which is Camera with blue light condition You saw that and you saw out Tim Cook open the event today talking about the value of each product and then the magic that Three products that we we're here for today. Bring together. I mean that's what you have when you're thinking about upgrading. You might have one of these products that are older than another and you want to get into that cycle. So that you can take better Also feel that magic that crook was talking about. Well, I wonder if the most significant announcement was the price of that, you know, lowest tier, iPhone 14, and it being the same as the iPhone Yeah it the the price are the same is a good and a bad depending where you're looking at it right that we have seen some of the Electronic companies bringing their prices up earlier in the year because of inflation others were kept on the same I think what was interesting ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,280,2022-09-07 21:08:21

So, there's a lot of different price point there that will help the bottom line. And as I said, it's the magic of the three coming together. The Kind of a sleeper hit when they came out and it's been a long time. A lot of people been waiting for an upgrade. You know, it was also said today that Yes And $50 on something that is yes but also easy to misplace. Well speak for him experience our teenager but always loses them so I feel I feel that pain they made it easier but to find them today fair enough right so you can find the case and you can find each individual airport in an easier way and I think the the silly thing of the emoji engraving speaks also to Popularity where you have a households where you have multiple airports that live together and that will make it easier for the Just about which one is mine. And again with all of these products we talked about new chips, Clearly you know Big tech upgrades even though we might not Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. For joining us. Good to see Alright, coming up apple. Seems to have supply chain issues under control.

So, Angela, first of all Let's talk about supply chain management for this new slate of products is Apple gonna be able to get all of these new iPhones and watchers and AirPods two people who want them in time for the holidays. I mean as far as getting it in time for the holidays yes we think so yeah I think it's interesting that it's clearly the the timing of this event clearly being on September 7 in the actual launch of the phone phones right I mean you were talking September 16 I believe is when shipments start pretty much all week earlier than we had Anticipated to be honest with you I think that in itself should tell you that there are absolutely managing the supply constraints that you know maybe they had a content with more severely earlier this year in a much better situation so they should be better Here over the next couple of months. Then others out there. Now, I will say this. As far as these phones are concerned, I mean, it is more supply driven than the man driven in terms of expectations for the September quarter. We do expect Over the next couple of weeks and I think it's really interesting with how they kinda put the launch of these phone rights to be able to phone four phones four devices will be available at the end of next week where the other one will be and I on in October so that'll help them also Navigate to constraint and put more emphasis on those pro devices with her course or higher price in better margin. So interestingly when you look at the Apple website and the shipping times a lot of those times have come down which is sort of our gauge of you know how much ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,282,2022-09-07 21:17:13
6634,Necessarily actually expect them to you know shut down any type of production out there to be honest with you as more and more chips companies out there tons of ball within China there's actually a possibility where Apple food potentially use their local semiconductor manufacturer in the industry as well but that being I mean we do expect them to continue to look for ways to expand and further diverse by outside of China but India will be the the key there. I don't know how much of a an impact side of the chip We'll have within the US but I think only time will sell. The big question remains how many people are gonna upgrade these upgrade their devices in the middle of a downturn when they're already paying more for everything How significant do you think the pricing that we heard today the Apple Watch Ultra at 799 the the the new iPhone 14 at seven The same price it was. Yeah. That seems to be pretty significant. It's Raise the prices on some of those pro devices when I'm kind of happy that they didn't to be honest with you when you kinda look and assholes here first off are forecast for the upcoming cycle here in front of the iPhone 14 cycle it is actually no growth in terms On the unit side I think however we do expect average selling prices to increase about three% at least three% and that's gonna just be the the the actual improving Teaching me the mini out there adding a six. Seven inch plus device and then yeah just just what they've been now ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,283,2022-09-07 21:21:33

Look at this very similar to how the Mac was theoretically designed for creatives. The watch is now also an outdoor enthusiast specialty. You don't need a dive computer. You don't need a garment watch. If you are a triathlete or anybody frankly that just really wanted all day battery life and it'd be out there and to know it was gonna work. I think they struck a chord These were complaints that had been in the marketplace and now they've addressed them. So, you know, let's talk about what this means over the longer term because you know, Revenue Are you seeing apple becoming even more reliant on the iPhone or still less reliant on the I think the world is reliant on smartphones so that iPhone absolutely has to have features that sell it because it drags the entire ecosystem with it and that's not gonna change. Huh What are you looking when you when you look out over the holidays and you know potentially a very busy quarter but customers under Groceries and literally Thank you Apple What do you think this upgrade cycle is really gonna look like in a downturn? I think the app's great cycles gonna be contentious. And people have to make choices between what they're gonna buy and in some cases this is gonna be our unit. Are you gonna have an iPhone? But having said that a smartphone is so critical to what people do in their lives. That they'll choose a smartphone oversight in PC. At something.

To connect to these satellites, you need to be outside with a clear view of the sky. And the band with is so limited that even sending a text message is a technical challenge. The only way to tap into such a network is with an expensive device that uses a bulky external antenna. We knew that approach just wouldn't work for iPhone. So we invented another way.

6640,"So if this is a good first step as you say what do you imagine the second and third step might be? Yeah so Clearly this is a an opening salvo by Apple. It provides a basic level of service. It can probably draw some extra interest in the iPhone 14. But I think given what's happening in the broader landscape of Apple is serious about this. They would have to look at potentially building a satellite consolation of the Rome. Perhaps not a surprise that Global Star does have a filing for over 3000 satellites to potentially launch and they'd have to build satellites unlike the current second gen or recently ordered third gen's satellites that have a much bigger antenna, much more power, and are optimized for working with that consumer handset. So let's play this out a little bit. Do you imagine that someday Apple might be interested in building a competitor to starlink for example? No, I'm not. I would say not exactly Starling Star Link's main purpose is is broadband and you know that's not Apple's game at least potentially here in the near term I think the reason that they partnered with Global Or they're probably one of the the weaker players in terms of their current revenue and their their customer profile within the satellite mobile satellite spectrum industry what they do have is a very good spectrum position And ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,289,2022-09-07 21:47:41

Apple CEO Tim Cook there before we go on a recap the days event I am joined out by Bloomberg's Mark German our resident Apple expert and Julia ask a forest to research vice president and principal analyst there good to see you Julie Marco wanna start with you because obviously you previewed so many of the things What stood out most to you? You know, leading up to the to the event. There were a lot of analyst tour expecting iPhone price likes particularly on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max line. I had never heard that was So I didn't believe it was happening in little do we know they announced today we know price likes very interesting in light of inflation price increases you're seeing from Meta from Samsung from other companies however there are some inflationary related price increases you're seeing in Europe and India but if you want an iPhone 14 Pro it's going to be Same 999. Now, I will know if you look at the fine print. It's some of the carrier deals this year. They're not as aggressive as last year, right? So, last year, you were able to upgrade from a 12 Pro Max to a 13 Pro Max and get like 50 bucks cash back on top of getting that new phone.

That's so much better. It's so much brighter. The pictures are so much better. I have no idea. So, there's a lot of things I think that are just subtle. I think a lot of the other things they did, they added sensors, right? So, when you add sensor, would you get more data? You get more precise data. They can model more activities. Like my favorite as I My kick sets in the pool. Right? They can do that with these kinds of sensors. There's other really subtle things about managing the battery like dimming the phone. You know the transparency, the special audio, there's a lot of things that are just really subtle I think that are hard to communicate to consumers but when consumers They just have a wow effect What's your sense of how difficult supply chain issues are gonna be to manage over the next 6 months You know I would say not being an expert in the supply chain. You know it seems to be impacting the world economy but somehow Apple seems to be doing okay. You would agree with that, right? I mean, when you look at the lead times on these various products, they're not that Yeah so far on the Applewood Ultra what we're seeing is only one the three variations is already shipping at the end of October whereas you still get first day September 20 Availability. For two of the bands. Now, the the impact seems to be on the bands themselves, not the watch ultra. So, if you're trying to get a Walter watch ultra on launch day, my recommendation for you would buy any band combination just to get that Worry about buying the band you want later.

He feels like it's made them stronger on the other side but also that they're gonna be deliberate about that spending. Do you have any sense of where Apple Pull back and not quickly. Yeah, I mean, I think that you're seeing budget cuts across the company. I don't think you're seeing that happen to court areas. I think that they have enough people to launch the products they wanna launch. I think you're gonna see a slow down in hiring. In fact, they are doing slow down hiring. It's very difficult right now to get hiring approval at Apple. You're gonna see them spend probably about the same on research and development.

Another level of complexity and energy and danger. When you go suburbal, if you're just gonna go up above the Von Carmen line which is 100 km or about 62 mi You will need to get up to maybe 5000 mi an hour so if you get up there and you go basically straight up and then straight back down you don't have the reentry heating that you would see coming in from a normal so when you go orbital I don't care if you're a baseball or a battleship you gotta go 17500 mph not just 1000 mi an hour. The energy is involved are much greater. I'm doing that. SpaceX has gone another level up and that's what they're doing with the inspiration for. For your chance To go to space.

I'm talking situations like kidnappings, hostage cases. Murder we're talking rape we're talking you know the worst violent crimes that occur in our society happen inside Airbnb's Airbnb never wants these kinds of cases to end up in the headlines. You know that's really bad for the the brand, their reputation, and their public image. Particularly because this is a business that's based on strangers trusting one another. So when crimes like this occur that kind of threatens their entire business model. I'm Olivia Carville. I'm a reporter on Bloomberg's technology team and I've been covering online travel companies like Airbnb for the last 2 years. Airbnb is a startup that's based in Silicon Valley and like many of the sharing economy startups it managed to grow so big so fast by essentially skirting regulations. It was based on that premise of moved fast and break things and it wanted to work against regulations in order to grow as big as possible and when the popular vote because it became so popular so fast that cities could no longer control it.

I think it's gonna be awkward when they have to, you know, put in their perspectives, their risk factors when they have to say, well, you know, one risk is that Thing might be someone illegal in in our biggest market. And in December of that year a young woman from Australia flew into New York and stayed in an Airbnb with a group of her friends. They picked up a key from the local corner bodega without even needing identification. The police report said this 29 year old woman left her friends at a midtown bar and returned to the Airbnb on her own. She thought that she was alone but she wasn't There was a man inside the apartment hiding in the shadows with a kitchen knife. He grabbed her During tour room and rape tour. Hey later fled.

Airbnb is one of the few companies in the world that has this like online offline kind of hybrid Where you have users who Meet online and then Meet in the offline world and stay under the same roof. And that means that the company at the end of the day really has to take more responsibility than other social media platforms might do. Will there be terms of service that really means that whenever there's a dispute between hosts and guests and the company this is all handled behind closed doors and arbi Most of these cases don't even make it to the courtroom and when they do the company will settle them so it doesn't go on through the courts. And what that means is that there hasn't really been a legal president that sit to determine what year BMB's liability is here.

It passes over 90% of the world's population without most of us ever realizing At an estimated cost of 150 1 billion dollars it's the most expensive object with ever built. You think about like the 16 chapel, the pyramids, and the birds Khalifa or or to take your pic. I mean, it's far outstrips those. It's the one and only Us real human outpost we've had a constant human footprint in orbit for almost 20 years because of the international space station. The collaboration between 15 countries started construction in 1998 and was peace together in space over the course of a decade Since 2000 it's been a permanently crude research laboratory a space habitat that's allowed humankind to live manufacture and explore beyond earth The over arching achievement of the space station has been It is educated us about how to do research it's educated us about how to live it's educated us about the harshness of the environment that it is in and it's about learning I think.

In the shadow of Nasa's sprawling Johnson's space center the headquarters have start up a space might seem a little modest but their goal is big to build the first commercial space station Buy a former ISS program manager the team has been involved in every mission to the station since its inception We know it has to be much lower cost operate on orbit than ISS is today. So, this is key to continuing the heritage by SS. It's to start there so we can evolve everybody to the next platform. I like in this to the internet. So, the internet was created. We got very excited and any kid with a good idea and just the basic programming Could go build a program to do something. We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today, there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a micarabian environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet. Is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us. All the benefits that that's gonna entail. But over time it will become very very obvious.

It's almost like when Neil Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space, to building our permanent home and space. Other private companies also want to use the ISS as a starting point for their own ventures. Big hello aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station Including Sierra Nevada and Nanarax have put forward proposals Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a false economy to say, okay, we're done with the international space station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. Is much more likely and realistic in what Nasa is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attached to the space station or work collaboratively with The next chapter of cannot occur without the active engagement of companies. Engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers it might be in service of government mission objectives we will return American astronauts to the moon not only to leave behind footprints and flags but to build the foundation we need to send Americans Mars and beyond.
