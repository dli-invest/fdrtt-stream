So I will ask question and obviously there's a there's a potential for a downside And our view is that US inflation probably has peaked and we'll start to come off for many of the reasons that we're just discussed Particularly at the at the pub for the US consumer have come down etcetera but the real sticky bit of inflation is of course in the labor market and that's where there's some progress that's been made but a lot more than has to be has to be accomplished. Issues or the indicators that we look at is the gap between job openings and the labor force that this sort of labor wage gap let labor and and job opening scap that's coming down and that's actually the key to a soft landing that if it did if the the gap comes down but you don't have to have a corresponding significant rise in an unemployment that's kind of the the narrow Broadly expecting but the key point to make here is that if the market gets happy about an optically better inflation print and starts to rally that's gonna mean the financial conditions ease which means that the burden on the fed remains that much more significant so this is sort of negative ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1729,2022-09-12 02:10:49

Worry about we cure and actually some we could pound and some of the things that you know the stress is talking There's a serious questions about how she funds all of her plans Yes I mean the pound has been weak particularly against the dollar this less serve against the euro. Yeah. But increases in borrowing. Rising inflation those are not going to be things that are good for the pound So this it is a factor that needs to be taken into account by the new government in designing their economic policy But on the other hand there is a need to do something to emiliate rising energy prices so there's a balance to be struck there by the government and there's balance to be struck by the bank of England but I would expect interest rates to continue to rise to three to four% the market's expecting I think four% In the early part of next year. For mortgages. Is is this your biggest concern when you look at the UK as a whole? Is it consumer spending but actually could we see a mortgage collapse? Well we've seen very cheap mortgages for a long time and actually that's fueled house price inflation which until recently has running at double digit levels it's come off a little bit We can't sustain double digit house price inflation so if I'm mortgage rates bring a bit more realism into the housing market And put a damper on house price increases that's not necessarily a bad thing and it actually makes it easier for first time buyers to get on the house housing ladder So interest rates have sort of mixed effects in the housing market.

That positioning is still very strong in the data and we could definitely see even though rates are reasonable, then becoming more unreasonable in the short term. Can you correlate On bon price down yield up into an equity bet on trend. Yes I mean as once we see that things have leveled out I think I've always said that this is an inequity story it's a bond story so once we see that bonds have stabilized and we have a much more healthy curve and more of a risk premium out in the curve so we see much more of a steeper curve I would think that that's really sort of a risk Signal that we can all start to think about those premiums as opposed to potential destruction of great rises cuz we all forget even though it's better going forward the bonds we do now really take a hit That this year.

I can't think of another example of where you Interest rate or you get paid on both side you get paid both to sell One thing we know about Cuddles trading arcade is that they were very comfortable taking large risks and you know you have to be clear this was a large risk Yeah, we spoke to oil traders, both people that know these guys and people that don't and they all say that this is, you know, incredibly risky and that's actually what stops a lot of all traders doing trading like this.

They all made a huge amount of money while all these people lost. That's Shocking but lots of people say these guys are acute disadvantage. They're in a market that's inhabited by, you know, huge Driven And firms and oil giants. They've got all the advantages in the world and when you get a bunch of Essex geezers who essentially beat the market and find a way to make a huge amount of money they should get a pat on the back really because that's the dream. Since this happened a lot of the guys have stopped trading the monthly settlements that they've done so well out in the past several of them have set up new companies they've essentially gone very quiet you Close down by all accounts there you know waiting this out It's certainly too early to try and predict how the regulatory investigations are gonna pan out.

8218,"Bite against climate change. So one of the challenges in reporting on carbon offsets and trying to figure out what's going on is really finding good experts who who have been steeped in this marketplace and are willing to candidly talk about it One of the best people for this is a fellow named Mark Trechler and I've been talking to him for more than a decade. My name is Mark Krexler. I've worked in climate change for the last 30 years. I was actually hired by the World Resources Institute in Washington to work on the first carbon offset project in 1988. In terms of defining a carbon offset that one of the beauties so to speak of greenhouse gases sort of the silver lining of greenhouse gases Atmosphere it can be anywhere in the planet in 7 days And therefore, you know, if there's an option to reduce emissions on the other side of the planet and you can do that very cheaply as compared to doing it in your factory for example, then, why not pay that person that factory on the other side of the planet to reduce their emissions Then you are in a sense of setting Emissions and the atmosphere doesn't really see your emissions anymore So carbon offsets have been been around for quite some time and they were actually key with these international climate agreements such as the Keoto protocol which mandated the weal Countries reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The treaty was signed on the 11th of December 1997. A business community it in general saw a carbon offsets as a huge opportunity to comply with whatever policies and measures might be coming down the pike on climate change much more cost effectively ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1992,2022-09-12 17:01:39
8219,"Office buildings and television studios that consume electricity So these companies are trying to make major major reductions in their carbon footprints but it's very difficult to change these fundamental ways their businesses operate. So Disney has been a big buyer of carbon offsets that are orchestrated by the nature conservancy One of the projects that they buy from is called Pennsylvania Ridges and that's a plot of land most of the land is actually about 3 hour drive outside of Philadelphia Interestingly this land 3000 of these acres was actually acquired by the nature conservancy and the late 1990's. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So, they they do what they they've done so well for all of these years which is they go out. They raise money from local plant therapists and they go And at the time according to an archive version of the nature conservancy's website They when they were proudly announcing this deal they said these threats have been abated because of this Fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project And if you look through it, this land is a key part of that carbon project And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened 72% of the trees are gonna be cut within 5 years Now, this is just astounding because this land is owned by the nature conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations. Is not really plausible ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1993,2022-09-12 17:05:59
8220,"One of the the challenges with with designing carbon offset systems is that there are normally two people at the table. You have buyers and you have sellers and to some extent, you have policy makers but you know, the buyers and the sellers are really the ones with the expertise with the with the incentive to really Hard make a lot of things happen And the the challenge there is is that both of them sort of want the same thing or they're both happy with the same thing. They're happy with low cost, offsets, and a lot of them because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere. So to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate. Discussions and so the policies end up by using the whole system And and you you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. And when it comes specifically to the topic of carbon offsets I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help me to get climate change. They absolutely can. Climate change then it's nothing but a distraction. You know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? Unfortunately Ultimately, what needs to be, what needs to happen is systemic change. You know, we're we're sort of nibbling around the edges with some of these different things. We need to change how we produce energy. We need to change how we transport We need to change what and how we eat yo we we need systemic change ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1994,2022-09-12 17:10:20
8221,Crazy idea 6 years before. Companies all around the world have been developing and testing the technology needed to propel passengers speeds of over 1000 km per hour. But for many speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the hyperloop world it's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic We've got plans Boats we're getting around earth. What if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it. Name for it which is called the hyperloop. Hyperloop? Hyperloop? Yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Mosque released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube. Usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward Because there's no traditional friction sources like air resistance or rolling friction that would push back against the pot. The hyperloop is able to move an incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently. Despite its futuristic name however the general concept behind hyperloop is actually pretty old. In fact New York City's first attempt at an underground public transit system in the 1870's was based on a similar principle. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1995,2022-09-12 17:14:37
8222,"Number one question we got from investors or from project proponents or just people in general was like is a hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it? But convincing investors in governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology. There's no easy task. First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because you know, it's faster than driving and most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before. They've seen someone get off of one before. And so what we set out to do was actually show that hyperloop could be safe with two normal people not astronauts not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that too normal people getting on a hyper lube and then most importantly those two people getting off. But Beyonce concerns constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to be estimated tune of around 60 1 million US dollars per kilometer of track Disco to Los Angeles for example is likely to come with a price tag over 10 1 billion dollars and before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technology, right? So, this idea that because the smartphone existed, Uber could exist, And that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses.

8223,"Entities. Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds. There's very little commuting traffic between those urban areas. Hyperloop Changes that from the ground up Liverpool to Manchester is 5 or 6 minute journey Manchester to leads is also a 5 or 6 minute journey. What effectively does is create a single super city economy In this vision, the hyperloop acts a little more like a highway. We're pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a hyperloop network from say Liverpool to weeds while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop. For passengers For business For leisure that is utterly transformational For high value freight and logistics it's equally transformation But critically If you do a hyperlute network at scale. You begin to deliver Massively significant carbon savings to A multi-regional hyperloop network could become a replacement for both short haul passenger and cargo flights and traditional ground transportation both of which are significant carbon produce One hyperloop connected distribution hub Perhaps at an airport that is predominantly used for international air freight replacing maybe 10 15 distributed road hubs.

8224,Lane switching on traditional rail requires the physical movement of the rail. Even moderate magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another and this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity And in the end the usefulness of the real network Because the moment that a track is switching that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it so you need a lot of space between trace All the vehicles can be much closer to each other you can achieve a very high frequency and basically have a vehicles moving and merging in and out of the network very much like a highway For now though Heart's Physical Testing has been limited by the size of their tube Because the test track is only 30 m long they haven't tested this lane switch at speeds greater than 20 km per hour however the company is working to build a new test site We're plans to increase that testing speed to 300 km per hour. Where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network Most of those are proven systems are very demonstrated in lab conditions so we don't really believe that's the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all hyperloop companies out there actually building a hyperloop system requires more than just a good product we're talking about the safety aspects we're talking about integration into the environment we're talking about the social aspects do people feel comfortable travelling in such a system so it's about all these different aspects ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,1998,2022-09-12 17:27:42

Virgin hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route with projects and various states of development in India Saudi Arabia and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a hyperloop certification center in West Virginia A six mi long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial if hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make the idea there's multiple hyperloop companies I think is a redeeming aspect in the business People really want to see something happen so having multiple people move forward Is is good for that I was struck When Sarah wrote the pod Two or three of the major outlets use the phrase we now have a new mode of transport and although all of that technology had existed before those two human beings wrote it yeah It was the moment at which those two human beings traveled that short distance down the tube but in popular imagination hyperloop became a Airlines anymore.

So, for green hydrogen again from renewable electricity, Places with the best renewable resources things like Latin America or the Middle East even Southern Europe have really really good potential for producing hydrogen and then when you're looking at blue hydrogen which is produced from natural gas or coal with carbon caption storage we do see that becoming more expensive than green hydro The future especially is renewable electricity costs come down but that can be available option in places like the US Gulf Coast or Russia where you've got good geological storage for the carbon as well as ample natural gas that's quite cheap.

And when you think about the amount of land and water is about a third that's currently used for agriculture in a one fifth, one, sixth of all greenhouse gases. And the world simply cannot sustain the kind of demand increases We're expecting on me.

Absolutely. I mean, look, honestly, I think this will be as big as when the NFL went to cable back in 1987. You know, we know how NFL games legitimized and grew the cable. Cable business and we think the same thing can happen for streaming. So, you let negotiations for this 13 1 billion dollars 11 year deal. It is a massive deal. How did you convince The NFL the Amazon was the place to be. Right. Well, you know, the NFL cares important, cares a lot about scale and reach and we've got that. We've got that better than any better than any other streaming service. They also care about production and they knew we we showed in Up and we also showed firework in the US that we can produce the best broadcast for fans. It's incredibly important to them. And one of the most exciting things for me is they care about innovation. You know, the the NFL has been able to stay top of mind for sports fans, for decades because they innovate and they move forward and they have that And that's the biggest that was one of the biggest tenants in our deal with the NFL we agreed to push each other into continue to push each other on innovating on behalf of sports fans and it's something that's personally really exciting and and something that really excites the team.

They only really suffered one partial failure. Really early in their testing regime. So, this is the first time in pretty much all of new shepherd's history that they've had Failure like this. So, I think it's it's probably going to be a while before we see new shepherd fly again. So what is next here you know when something like this happens significant failure like this you go back to the drawing board you know can years pass Potentially as we see with Nasa before someone else before they they try to attend this once again. Yeah it really depends on the source of the failure the FAA already said today that they're going to be looking into this fortunately no one was hurt today and the booster that you saw breakaway from that capsule Fall into a hazard, a designated hazard zone. So, ultimately, everyone wanted to save but yes, the FAA said they will look into it and you shepherd won't fly again until they get to the root of the problem and it really, like I said, depends on on what the source of the issue is, you know, with these commercial companies, they can be a little bit more nimble when it comes to return Flight. We've seen SpaceX return to flight pretty quickly after seminomalies in the past and so maybe it could be similar from blue origin.
