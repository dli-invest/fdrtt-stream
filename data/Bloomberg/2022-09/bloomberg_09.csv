Was struggling as where other mixed martial arts promoters. It was pretty much a fixer upper. The money that they spent to actually purchase it for two 1 million dollars was much less than the money they quickly had to sink into it in order to revitalize it. They pulled off a multipronged strategy that was quite successful. First they did what white has referred to as running towards regulation. They found ways to make compromises with state regulators so that the sport would not be illegal. And at the same time they also popularized it they made gambles like paying the production costs themselves for the first season of a reality TV show The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV Weaving compelling personal narratives and rivalry people throwing shoes Coming to the octagon with who let the dogs out playing while he was dragging another guy on a leash.

The CEO of Strike Force Scott Coker Said in the past that he saw himself like Luke Skywalker up against the death star trying to compete with UFC. When strike force was bought out by UFC my only option was go to because they had the rest of my contract now I'm under a contract where it's only a 18 month contract with six fights but 5 years later I'm still stuck in the contract The month before UFC's parent company Zufa It's acquisition of strike force.

In UFC After year the share of the company is revenue that goes to actually The workers doing the fighting has hovered around or below 20% and what does it shows through complex statistical progression modeling is that if the UFC Was competitive and did not allegedly violate the any trust laws it would pay its fighters 50% or more of the revenue is generated just like baseball just like hockey just like basketball If instead of paying 20% of the revenues generated it paid 50% or more of the revenues generated The fighters would have made $one. 6 billion more during the period that we measured 2010 to 2017. When you write about allegations against companies in particularly about lawsuits against companies those companies Don't wanna say a whole lot about them or are pretty dismissive of the significance of litigation against them. UFC in their comments to me Been pretty feisty about this saying that they see this lawsuit actually as a threat to the ability of businesses to take risks in succeed They don't wanna Roll over.

As it stands this is what a map of the sea bed looks like or that black those are the parts we haven't mapped yet At present most people think that the sea floor is actually mapped because you'll see a world ocean map and you can see some shape of the sea floor but most of that is based on prediction roughly 80% of what you see for the world ocean floor is modeled based on measurements of the sea surface height and a Based on gravity.

The closer you get to the floor with your flashlight, the smaller that beam is. If you have 400 of these beams all across, I think of 400 people holding a flashlight. The closer they hold that Which also means the smaller that you can find information or data about. So, it really depends on the depth of the sea floor in order to see how much you can define an object. This variation in depths means that mapping resolution will range from 100 by 100 m in shallow waters to 800 by 800 m in the deepest parts of the ocean which go down as far as 11 1000 m.

We really need these cells to multiply to reach the numbers that are sufficient to make a meat product We're looking into the cells that are really important for me so we think about muscle cells, fat cells, by that isolation, we are able to form those muscle tissues in culture. The culture happens inside of a fermentation tank what we call the bio reactor which is essentially reviving the same conditions as the animal body warm temperatures some serve mechanical stimulation so that the cells are exposed to a very similar conditions that they Inside of the animal After the sales proof rates and reach a certain density the final step is essentially to separate those cells from the liquid breath that they are in we just make sure that the brother needs our quality and safety standards and then those cells are ready for consumption Milk, cheese, yogurt, a lot of those arrived from fermentations.

It spends heavily on big infrastructure projects. China's not the first to do it. Right after Pakistan became independent in the late 1940's early 50s the US was sending advisers in the Pakistan to help plants economy Is doing infrastructure projects there too. Those early projects help the US gain Pakistan as an ally against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US has provided about 80 1 billion dollars in aid to Pakistan since it's independence but overall the result is disappointing. One of the recent attempts was in the late 2000's as part of the US effort to combat terrorism in Afghanistan The number one item on that A package was to build these high visibility infrastructure projects Proposed to United States in the 2000's during that period that have become built in road projects China is stepping into a gap which has been left by retreating ambition from the US.

He's planned to develop Guada into an international port city. Guadar Port has an interesting history and an interesting location too. It's located in Boluchan. It's about 120 km from Iran. Pakistan purchased this territory from Oman. I think it's a 1950's. And so for a long time Pakistan has had on its agenda trying to Administration to pay for report even offered naval access if States was wanting to pay for that The US rejected Pakistan's offer concerned that the pork would not be commercially viable and would cause geopolitical tension But in the early 2000's a Chinese company was awarded the contract to build the port and they completed phase one of construction in 2006 The port was then managed by a Singaporean government entity. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,332,2022-09-08 00:55:52

So, look, we've got a really important BOJ needs coming up as well. There's a lot of focus on the fed. One could imagine that just being sort of short to the end here.

Let us get an update from our colleague Maria today who's on the ground for us in Frankfort, Bloomberg's European correspondent Maria today at Maria Really nice to see you this morning.

Stay with us for that. Joining us now here on Saturday in London. Dominion Bank Senior European rates strategist Peter nice to have you with us thanks for joining us joining us so there's question let's start with the sort of basics I suppose the question of 50 or 75 we heard a lot from the hawks around Jackson Hall in Europe just as we heard in the United States but there's always the commentary of Philip Lane ringing quite loudly perhaps in people's ears so are you 75. So I I would say it's more of a straight now. I think across all markets whether you look at US, UK and ACB. I think the key thing is that ACB will be facing markets before the other I think with respect to how markets take of I think 50 or 75 basically mean the same right now for markets because either ECB we need to do like Or they just do at once at 75. So the terminal rate and where they're heading is more important. With respect to the terminal rate markets as well as ECB members have been more or less on board with the two one to two% terminator and I think that's why I feel that even if they do a certified or a 50 today market reaction should be limited just given the fact that we saw pretty strong sell of post Jackson home. And I think He would be how Lagard actually focuses on the outlook that she presents so she will have further updates to inflation with inflation almost reaching 10% by the end of the year but she will also have to downgrade growth forecast we were not ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,405,2022-09-08 06:14:27

6758,"Let's see if the longer term Well clearly when you revalue your portfolio on the basis of higher interest rates the capital value of the portfolio goes down and so we report that marked market loss it is an unrealized loss and of course it will unwind over time as the bonds which is the principal part of our portfolio repay at par We will then benefit from a higher interest rates on the portfolio over time. So, we expect that negative impact to unwind over the next 2 years. Okay, so that's there that there's sort of profit story and how that's developed. In terms of your cost base, you you know, play the inflation is a global theme, inflation is something that your business Your staff are having to deal with. What is that doing to your cospace than having to think about remunerating staff more? Being asked to perhaps. What's clearly a demand for talent? And on top of that there are reflectionary pressures in terms of costs. So we are trying to respond to that. The biggest impact is really the inflation re impact on our And that's the issue that we're managing most actively in reserving and pricing for for our product. Yes, so how is inflation impacting both the premiums that can be charged and also the claims that you have to pay out, you know, the rising cost of the stuff you're having to Also the issue really is of course you charge a premium today but the the claims come in over a period of time and so inflation is is the difference in terms of that challenge when infilition's low you don't have to factor that in we do have to factor that in but it is on a lagging basis and so insurance is more susceptible on on inflation than Other lines of business. But we are factoring that into the way that we price for our products. And I'm confident that we're on top of the issue at the moment. So there are self-help things you can do.

You want know that you're covered for the things that you're paying for and of course, insurance want to price for the risks that they cover.

And of course trying to do things that that cause the minimum amount of stress for the maximum A return in terms of where we apply our efforts because a lot of this issue is quite urgent. Yeah, I mean, is it all about solvency too? Does it go broader than that?

It's really the last I guess Risk that Russia has total control over. They could cut supply via this link through Ukraine. Now, I think one of the key aspects to look at is what are policy makers in the European Union going to do on Friday when they discuss ways to curb power prices and fuel prices for consumers in the blog. One Things that they're looking at of potential price cap on imports of Russian gas That means that's supply coming through Ukraine would have some sort of price cap to Any kind of price cup would result in a total halt of energy exports he thinks it's foolish and that that kind of sets us where we are if you're does agree to some sort of price cap that would probably push Putin's hand to halt that Right and yet we didn't see any enormous amount of well we didn't see upside response in gas prices we saw when that line dropped I remember watching the oil price tick up a little bit we saw a bit of a spike there that was on wound for other reasons later but stick Why the market's not focused so much on on what Putin said yesterday.

These two things together add up for big drag on growth. And it feels like they would reluctant to do more and just need to go full in. So the challenge front scene is you can't really go full in on stimulus in an economy which you're also having to lock down to prevent COVID right the two forces are just moving in opposite directions so is there gonna be a change in in the oh COVID policy going forward so the consensus on this for months has We get to the party congress which we now know is on October the 16th Ping gets a third term as preeminent leader and then the exit from COVID oh begins the kind of the big diet around that is well October 16 isn't that far away and we don't seem to have seen any planning any strategizing any debate about what the exit from COVID oh looks like neither of we seen China To acquire the mRNA vaccines they'd need to give their population the best shot at resilience from the virus so my assumption is we still start moving in that that direction after October the 16th because how could we not But the proprietary steps don't seem to be being taken.

Yeah I think the most interesting is the increment and the forward guidance or the communication around that but I think the other aspects are worth watching out for too so on the projections I think the Are Much do they cut the growth numbers do they show a technical recession so we think they will lower the growth number substantially but stay away from showing a technical conversation and then the inflation projections will go up very substantially we think the key number is probably the 2023 number where we think they will go to four.

It's been 50 basis points in the meeting before more than the ECB had indicated beforehand especially if you And the ECB has bowed to raise rates further so I don't think that this decision today Any sort of hesitancy on doing what it takes to tackle inflation Question over here is whether anything the ECB can do really will help significant impact on inflation as the European inflation a bit unlike the US inflation the European Hey electricity and not the result of any Consumer demand over here or not yet at least the result of any excess wage pressures. Is there a pivot point threshold that you're looking for in other words is there a point of pain in the economy that might be big enough for the ECB to reverse course?

Three% in 2024 we talked The forecast on growth and question as to whether they are so called aspirational are they aspirational forecast considering that the forecast that I see on growth right now do not include a recession They say this after a rebound of the first half of 2022 recent data points were substantial slowdown in euros only economic growth with the economy expected to stagnate later in the year and in the first Of 2023.

I can agree with you more. When we look at the outlook More interested in the price of gas next year and if they could have that price right now thank imagine how much more confident they'd be about what they have to do Over there why is it not being reflected by any other central Even though to a lesser degree other banks are facing the same outlook. We can head over to the ECB chief right now. Let's listen in. Good break So Today the vice president and I welcome you to our press conference. The governing council today To raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points This major step front loads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates Towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation 12 two% medium term target. Based on our current assessment over the next several meetings we expect to raise interest rates further To dump and demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,496,2022-09-08 12:52:02

The governing council will therefore continue applying flexibility Investing redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase program portfolio With a view to countering risk to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. The decisions taken up today are set out in a press release available on our website. A separate technical press release on the remuneration of government deposits Will be published at 345 I will now apply in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. The euro area economy grew by oh. Eight% in the second quarter of 22. Mainly owing to strong consumer spending Contact intensive services as a result of the lifting of pandemic related restrictions. Over the summer as people traveled more With large tourism sectors benefited especially. At the same time Businesses suffered from high energy costs and continued supply bottle next although the letter have been gradually easing. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,497,2022-09-08 12:56:30
6849,Eight. Three% and it was again the dominant component of overall inflation. Market based indicators suggest that in the near term Oil prices will moderate while wholesale gas prices will stay extraordinarily high. Food price inflation also rose in August to 10. Six% Partly reflecting higher input costs related to energy Disruptions of trade in food commodities Worst weather conditions. While supply bottlenecks have been easing These continue to gradually feed through to consumer prices. Are not putting upward pressure on inflation Azzi's recovering demand in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro has also added to the build up of inflationary precious. Price pressures are spreading across more and more sectors. In part owing to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Accordingly measures of underlying inflation remain at elevated levels and the latest staff projections see inflation excluding food and energy Three. Nine% in 22 Three. Four% in 23 And two. Three% in 24 Brazilian flavor markets and some catch up to compensate for higher inflation To support growth in wages. At the same time incoming data and recent wage agreements indicate that wage dynamics remain contained overall. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,498,2022-09-08 13:00:46

Unexpect to raise interest rates further. Because inflation remains far too high And is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. This major step Front loads the transition Prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates Towards levels that will support a timely return of inflation 12 two% medium term target. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data dependent And follow a meeting by meeting approach. We stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate That inflation returns to our medium term inflation target. We are not ready to take your questions Thank you. My dad my god.

6851,The service sector Where supply factors are less prevalent and were demand plays a role. So we have a range of That are actually north of four%. So in the face of an inflation that is extremely high That is of a magnitude and persistent persistence across sectors of that nature. Obviously Had to be taken and this is very much in line Determination to actually normalize monetary policy as we started back in December So for those who consistently repeat that the European Central Bank is lagging behind I contend that we are on a journey Started back in December Where we decided to put an end to the asset purchases under Pep and under APP. To move out of negative interest rates as we did back in July and now to continue on our normalization path With a front clothing exercise that we conducted today because we believe that the deviation from Target is such that it warrants this front loading And we'll also decided that this was not a isolated But that we would raise interest rates further We didn't say that we would raise interest rates at 75% as if 75 was the norm It is not We will determine meeting by meeting on the basis of data ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,500,2022-09-08 13:09:22
6852,For next year why don't you see a recession because many economists do see one thank you? Let me let me start with the with the second one. So the the Baseline outlook Three. One for 22 One. Nine for 23 Sorry Three. One for 22 oh. Nine for 23 and one. Nine for 24. So that's the baseline That that that we have in the projection by stuff We also have an i think you will be receiving those documents as well we also have a downsight scenario that has been produced by staff on the basis of assumptions Of risks in particular some of which have already materialized And in those numbers you will see that from memory Growth outlook is at two. 962 is at minus Nine 423 and at one. Nine again for 24 so Even in our baseline we foresee some stagnation for the last quarter of 22 and the first quarter of 23 In the baseline we don't forecast Negative growth in 23. In the downside scenario we do that downside scenario differs from the currency situation in that it includes in particular Total shutdown of all Russian gas supply ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,501,2022-09-08 13:13:54
6853,And that's what what made it so hard We need to act forthrightly strongly as we have been doing and we need to keep at it until the job is done Social cost that that I had to bring it into play in order to get inflation back down and set us up then for for a long period of price stability You know that that that speech that the point really there was to deliver a speech that was narrowly focused on inflation more direct and a lot shorter than a typical Jackson whole speech And I thought that what was appropriate was a very you know kinda concise and focused message to your question The message really was that the Fed has and accepts responsibility for price ability by which we need two% inflation over time Remains well above target the greater the risk at the public does begin to see higher inflation as the norm and that has the capacity to really raise the cost of of getting inflation down so finally history cautions strongly against prematurely loosening polic I I can assure you that my colleagues and I are strongly committed to to this project and and we will keep at it until the job is done I can also assure you that we never take into consideration Political Considerations you know we we we are accountable to the public through congress that's that's a very fundamental important aspect of our work but We we do not we we focus solely on the goals that congress has given us and that's what we're gonna do here. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,502,2022-09-08 13:18:09
6854,Around two% of course short term expectations Are higher because of high current inflation and also the clock is ticking as I mentioned the longer Inflation remains well above target the the greater the concern that the public will start to just naturally incorporate higher inflation into its economic decision making and our job Is to make sure that doesn't happen and we're committed to doing that job. It seems to me there's a chance. There's there's a real risk that the labor market the labor shortage is persist Does that create a risk that takes some of the ability to manage Process out of your hands The extent that they're continue to be labor shortages does that then feed into expectations that the public has About inflation As you mentioned very prominently Well I think you I think you're right that if if it does turn out that we are in a world of a persistent labor shortage over time that will be that'll be a challenging world for companies and and it will certainly create upper pressure on wages and that sort of thing Today the labor market is demand is very very strong still in the labor market we're still printing new payroll job numbers at high level wages are are running at at elevated levels and so what we think by by our our policy interventions what we hope to achieve A period of growth below trend At which will take which will cause the labor market to get back into better balance and then that will bring wages back down to levels that are more consistent with two% inflation over time.

Now, of course, economies ever changing and that too could change. You know, to where it is important again, but for now, and for, for really many years now, monetary agriculture, don't play an important role in our formulation of policy.

Financial crisis. Contribution of inflation or do you annually reestimate trend growth and if you do that you're incorporating both communications issues but also You know just a big chances of policy era because we just don't know these things with that kind of we don't know any of the of the starred variables so to speak with with that level of certainty so I'll just say it's it's it's a it really interesting and it works very well in in models but it seems To implement from a practical standpoint and it's not something that we that we have chosen to do or that we you are currently looking at. You mentioned a dual mandate You know I don't wanna ignore the race during this conversation you know when I said earlier that you know obviously having a version to you know fully discretionary monetary system many of us also regret the adoption of the mandate in lieu of a strict focus on monetary stability The feds on website acknowledges that maximum employment is driven mainly by non monitoring factors and if we accept that, does it really make sense for employment to be part of the Feds mandate?

So we have a lot of information that we have to get pretty quickly to really understand what's going on. Finding asteroids is just one piece of the puzzle. Planetary scientists are extremely skilled and determining the orbits and speeds of asteroids based on relatively small amounts of data. Nasa runs simulations of the trajectories asteroids could take which is useful but time consuming A team of scientists in the Netherlands have found a way that could buy us more time. Our methods is very quick. So you can very quickly get an assessment of whether or not your objects is dangerous or not. If you look at the classical way of determining the danger of an asteroids it may take you know days of computing time on very big machines To determine Asteroid Power on all of them So the neural network allows us to focus on what really could go and Post a hazard to earth. A neural network is a computing system that mimics the way the human brain operates to find underlying relationships in a set of data by training the network in this way you you train it in recognizing those objects that are most likely to hit the planets And once it strains you can apply this network to all the unknown restaurants. And then you can make a selection and saying hey this is these are the ones which appear to be having orbits similar to the ones which we know are hitting the planets.

It also means we might not have to resort to launching a nuclear warhead as an asteroid. Until recently, pretty much our only choice. That's an option of last Spacecraft.

Basically the floaters are going up and down and pushing the hydro cylinders which transmit by the graduable fluid into land located accumulators. Which is turning the generators. System is controlled by smart automation system which you can see right here and in case of a common storms the system automatically raises the floater above the water level and keeps them in the airport position until the storm passes. The company has been operating a 100 kilowatt grid connected device in Gibralta since 2016 which is enough to power 100 households. Currently entering her team are working on another 100 kilowatt project at the porter jafa in television The project will be also the first time in the history of Israel that wave energy will officially connect to the electrical grid and our goal going forward is to expand it All suitable break waters in the city of Tel Aviv and to supply significant part of the city's electricity needs. Today engineer is an entrepreneurs are still trying to crack wave energy. Globally only a few 100 kilowatts of wave energy are deployed compared with gigawatts of offshore wind. But the field has come a long way in recent years and with the right engineering solutions this new power source could eventually become competitive with more mature renewables like solar and wind. ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,541,2022-09-08 16:09:33

And that's a plot of land most of the land is actually about 3 hour drive outside of Philadelphia Interestingly this land 3000 of these acres was actually acquired by the nature conservancy in the late 1990's. This land was imminently threatened. There was a pending logging contract on this land. So, they they do what they they've done so well for all of these years which is they go out. They raise money from local phantopists and they go buy this land to protect it from developers and loggers. And at the time according to an archive version of the nature conservancy's They when they were proudly announcing this deal they said these threats have been abated because of Acquisition by the nature conservancy. So, it's really interesting now. Fast forward two decades to earlier this year when they put forward this carbon project. And if you look through it this land is a key part of that carbon project And what they're now saying is this land is now once again imminently threatened. 72% of the trees are gonna be cut within 5 years. Now this is just astounding because this land is owned by the nature conservancy. They do not clear cut land that they've bought through philanthropic donations.

They're happy with low cost, offsets, and a lot of the because that works for their business model. You end up though with nobody really representing the atmosphere. So to speak. Nobody's really representing the climate. Discussions and so the policies end up by using the whole system And and you you end up in sort of a race to the bottom and that's what we've seen happen. And when it comes specifically that the topic of carbon offsets I am a fan of carbon offsets in the sense that they can help me to get climate change. They absolutely can. Climate change then it's nothing but a distraction. And you know, after 30 years, you have to start wondering, is it really just a distraction? And that's really unfortunate but that's where we are.

But for many speed is only the first step to unlocking the full transformational effects of a new mode of transportation fast is what we just sort of take for granted in the high pollute world it's the network effects that really deliver the benefit and that opens up a completely different scale of economic We've got plans One reveals some boats. We're getting around earth. What if there was a fifth mode? And I have a name for it. Name for it which is called the hyperloop. Hyperloop? Hyperloop? Yeah. In 2013 while riding high on the growing success of Tesla and SpaceX Elon Musk released a white paper outlining the basic framework of the technology he called hyperloop. The basic idea goes a little something like this. A tube reduces the air pressure to a near vacuum like environment. A hyperloop pod is then suspended in the tube. Usually by magnetic levitation. The whole pod can then be propelled forward Because there's no traditional friction sources like irresistence or rolling friction that would push back against the pot the hyperloop is able to move it incredibly high speeds and do so fairly efficiently Despite its futuristic name however the general concept behind hyperloop is actually pretty old.

6908,"Number one question we got from investors are from project proponents or just people in general was like is a hyperloop safe? And what better way to show something is safe than by actually getting people on it. But convincing investors and governments that would likely be fronting some of the construction costs for an unproven technology it's no easy task First and foremost is the question of safety. Most people don't know how an airplane works but yet they get on an airplane. They get on an airplane because you know, it's faster than driving and most importantly, they've probably gotten off of one before they've seen someone get off of one before And so what we set out to do was actually show the hyper loop could be safe what two normal people not astronauts not adrenaline junkies or test pilots or anything like that so normal people getting on a hyper lube and then most importantly this two people getting off But Beyonce concerns constructing hyperloops will undoubtedly require a significant capital investment to be estimated tune of around 60 1 million US dollars per kilometer of track so a track from San Francisco to Los Angeles for example is likely to come with a price tag over 10 1 billion dollars. And before large governments are willing to come in and front those costs investors who are funding hyperloop development must accept it as a long-term mixture of technology and infrastructure investing Investors that are used to short returns because you're developing apps or something to that effect, you know, those aren't the investors that really get excited about hyperloop. What you start to see is the people that are looking at platform technology, right? So, this idea that because the smartphone existed, Uber could exist, right So who are like the Vanderbilts of this century and that's the part where you're gonna get a lot more nose than yeses.

What effectively does is create a single super city economy In this vision the hyperloop acts a little more like a highway where pods have fixed destinations and don't need to stop along the way. Meaning you can travel on a hyperloop network from say Liverpool to leads while the pod behind you travels from Liverpool to Manchester. And if that metro hyperloop network is connected to other networks from the same location you could travel from Liverpool to Paris or Liverpool to Amsterdam all without making a single stop. For passengers For business For leisure that is utterly transformational For high value freight and logistics it's equally transformation But critically If you do a hyperlute network at scale.

6910,"Physical movement of the rail. Even moderate magnetic levitation tracks use lane switching techniques in order to transfer trains from one track to another and this is a very crucial element because this is the thing that limits the capacity And in the end the usefulness of the real network Because the moment that a track is switching that means that at that moment you are creating an unsafe environment for the trains behind it so you need a lot of space between trains Because you have no moving components in the track. All the vehicles can be much closer to each other. You can achieve a very high frequency and basically have a vehicles moving, emerging in and out of the network very much like a highway. For now though Heart's Physical Testing has been limited by the size of their tube Because the test track is only 30 m long they haven't tested this lane switch at speed's greater than 20 km per hour however the company is working to build a new test site We're plans to increase that testing speed to 300 km per hour. Where we have proven most of the most important technologies in the test facilities And we have also demonstrated the viability and the feasibility of a network If you'll work at all the top systems that it consists of most of those are proven systems already demonstrated in lap conditions. So we don't really believe that's the technology itself is going to be the biggest challenge. Because for all hyperloop companies out there actually building a hyperloop system requires more than just a good product we're talking about the safety aspects we're talking about integration into the environment we're talking about the social aspects do people feel comfortable traveling in such a system so it's about all these different aspects ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,559,2022-09-08 17:27:50

Virgin hyperloop is also racing to construct the first commercial hyperloop route with projects and various states of development in India, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. Recently the company announced plans to build a hyperloop certification center in West Virginia which will include a six mi long test track. Proving the technology here will be crucial. If hyperloop networks can find a home among infrastructure investments that the Biden administration hopes to make. The idea there's multiple hyperloop companies. I think it's a redeeming aspect in the business People really want to see something happen so having multiple people move forward Is is good for that I was struck When Sarah rode the pod.

Virtually from Bob Marrow but it was sad that she was not well enough to be able to attend that and obviously overnight there had been a serious deterioration of her condition which led to the statement this afternoon. London time 12 30 here eh in London to say that she was under medical supervision and 6 hours later we had the official state From the palace that she had passed away so it is now for many people the shark of getting used to life without the queen that point that we we just heard it from John Arthur is making a 70 years on the throne means an awful lot of people in this country don' ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,569,2022-09-08 18:11:24

It is a day of great loss But Queen Elizabeth the second leaves a great legacy. Today the crown passes. Has done for more than a 1000 years. To our new monarch our new head of state his majesty king Charles the third. With the king's family we mourn the loss of his mother. And as we born we must come together as a people to support him. To help him bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all. We offer him our loyalty And devotion Just as his mother devoted so much to so many for so long.

Exactly as her majesty would have wished ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,570,2022-09-08 18:15:40
6920,"Other extraordinary statement she just called Charles Charles the third which is actually great which is actually pretty extraordinary because it really is up to him to sort of say so and there's a lot of You know analysis and form the nouns and speculation that you know really he probably wouldn't pick Charles the third given the history we know Charles the first had his head chopped off Charles the second you know the Charlesone have like a great reput Inputted this way amongst the kings and queens of England. So so does that mean that Well, I wanna say I mean I that she misspoke or she knows something that we don't know but send me it's worth reflecting on because you know either yeah both of those are are interesting and newsworthy because I think that was going to be something that was gonna be decided in coming days and certainly up to the new king and Mon To announce not to be sort of slipped out. So, it it's unclear whether the new prime minister was sort of making an assumption or whether she knew. But it's it's it's unusual put it that way. And you know which obviously pivots nicely to the Did the Queen had with Prime ministers of her age I mean there was a formidable and extraordinary Theater actually that kind of actually looked into this very thing and looked at all the meetings that she must have had very first being Winston Churchill And some of them she's like more than others we've all seen the crown But certainly it's Through through her eyes you've seen the complete transformation of the country And Flavia Stephen made the point that the new prime minister list trust probably didn't expect to be making this speech so soon so it's a period of enormous change for the UK a new prime minister a new monarch ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,571,2022-09-08 18:19:48
6921,"The full pump the full treatment and as you some of us may recall like you know he did his own little four pass in terms of sort of putting his hands on the queen which is certainly not something that anyone should do visiting dign Decide. So, yeah, I mean, I think it goes back to that special relationship, right? You know, on the and it's a little bit of love and hate. It's on the one hand, you know, you got, you know, a country that has like sort of free to self of the shackles of you know, of English monarch. But then also kind of Admires all sort of it's interested in sort of some of the sort of outdated Pump and and poshness of of the English royal family. So I think it it's it's fascination in this day and at the same time. But you know it's it it's part of that sort of rich fabric of history. And you know I think it it's sort of worth A little bit on the queen and like how you know dial back to 1992 what she called her Anna cerebralist where everything went absolutely wrong for her you know Diana the divorce that this and that this is a woman who's lived through Highs and lows and you know I think it it's quite extraordinary to sort of reflect that Tina the country now is It's going to miss her so very much.

6922,"Talk a little bit about the discretion. You know, we just heard from Flavia about The way that the queen never let on to what she was thinking in terms of opinion, political opinion. Does that remind you of anything that happened with other prime ministers in the past year, your experiences, and reporting there? Well, it's supposed to be a two-way street as well those prime ministers are also not supposed to share the details of their weekly meetings with the queen which Happened of course we've been saying now with 15 eh prime ministers over her reign eh there there was one incident where we did see that slip ever so slightly and it was during the campaign for the Scottish independence referendum in 2014 now the way that this came about is that the queen was greeting well wishers in Scotland and the run up to the vote eh and Seaside to one of them that people will think very carefully about the future ahead of that vote and it was not a you know people ask her this had come up because probably had raised the referendum with her and it was AA casual remark she made Of course we know the queen never made casual as my remarks so it was something very unusual at the time ehm but the sentence that she said was while I hope people will think very carefully about the future and that was seen as being a discreet signal from the queen that people should vote to remain as they did part of the United Kingdom in that referendum what emerged later David Cameron the then prime minister told the BBC in an interview that she had he had asked whether the queen could in his words raise an eyebrow about the prospect of Scotland voting for independence and that comment came later and it this was Very much frowned upon by the palace that he had divulged something that happened during these confidential conversations. I think the expression that was used was caused displeasure which in royal language is extreme. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,573,2022-09-08 18:28:38

I didn't get to go there and I said, you know, if she makes it to the plat I will 100% attend and I did and and Tim I have to say it was incredible to see the turnout not just from the folks at home that you saw in the United Kingdom but really from all around the world this is a truly Legacy and you're hearing that from the outpour that you're getting from of course the Commonwealth from the former colonies I might add of the British kingdom as well as of course the United States even Ursula Vonderland had come out the president of the of the EU and had comment said you know at the end of the day given all the Brexit kind of negoti That have gone on this kind of idea of whether or not the UK is or is not a part of Europe. She said at the end of the day, a European leader has passed and I think that's really Sentient I should say of unrepresentative of just how big her her her role was in the broader scheme of things I should also mention 70 years I mean Katie was talking about this John authors was talking about this earlier a lot of Brits have not actually lived a life without having this matri And this is going to be really crucial in terms of her legacy.

His statement continues to say that she seems so timeless and so wonderful that I'm afraid we have had to come to believe like children that she would just go on and on I wanna bring back in a pretty good and talk a little bit about the history here. 70 years. It span World War two. Yeah. Parts of World War two I should say. The end of World War two. We watched the 1952 so after the post war era. Yeah. In the UK but her experience during World War two was one that has been chronicled She's dead. In England during that time. She did. Despite the Nazi error rates. During the blitz. I'm in luck when the answer to the World War two 1939. She was 13 years old at the time and basically throughout the the war she actually spent her time. I wanna say Winster and Balmoral. So she was close to London but not in the heart of it. Alongside her Her sister Princess Margaret at the time I think what's really striking and it thinks speaks to her character and and this idea that duty comes first that country comes first that when she was 19 years old she trained for the British army she trained as a driver she trained as a mechanic she also trained as a nurse alongside a prince ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,575,2022-09-08 18:37:27

There is now much more imperative for a drive towards holding a referendum there any United Ireland not something that's going to be eminent but certainly the dial moved To Brexit referendum and the queen was seen as one of the unifying forces of the union and whether or not Transmitted in the same way under King the new king that is something that that is going to be a huge challenge and something that will change the fabric of how this country operates Do want to bring in Queen's again talking about her soft diplomatic power travelling as as head of state Hey Facebook An Irish person bought her her visit to Ireland in 2011 which was the first by a raining monarch eh and and it was something she took part in events which nobody had expected that she would take part she later wreath in the garden of rememberance which is where which commemorates people who died fighting for Irish independence from the United Kingdom and she also stood up at a state dinner In Dublin Castle and started her address with a few words of Irish she's had president and friends who are on August in Irish which Given that there was 30 years of fighting in Northern Ireland in which thousands of people died ending in a piece of agreement in 1998 the fractures relations that have existed since Ireland's independence between Dublin and London that was a momentous moment in Anglerwish relations seen and something that's been recognized by the Irish Prime Minister the theoretic speaking ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,576,2022-09-08 18:41:49
6926,And Margaret's actually was the prime minister and actually is a little girl. It was a wonderful time. Because you know you thought you saw these two Models until actually as as a woman you can do something And so going forward absolutely can Charles as he is now we just had confirmation from his office he will be known as King Charles the third That's just come through the last couple of minutes He We're having incredible Big shoes to fill. She was an absolutely For women and she She almost never put a foot wrong. She was never controversial. She never Gave an opinion when she shouldn't have Hey of course Charles has given opinion so that'd be quite interesting whether he carries on doing that it's not clear yet whether he will take a more constitutional role the the monarch is supposed to sit above politics and not get involved So he's been accused of meddling in the past and whether he will Do that going forward is is not yet clear I I suspect Because He has a very very defined constitutional role going onwards. But it I don't I sense of you can probably hear my voice Shock do you know? Yeah.

Well I think the thing is is that the the response doesn't happen yet because they will the public will have to get used to you were just talking about some of those fundamental changes that had to happen here and and people will have to get used to the idea After being king Charles the third and what that means for his style Of raining the the constitutional role is very limited and and you can be very sure that the queen will have instructed Charles over the years as to how you conduct yourself as a monarch and how the the monarchy should be should be Should fulfill its role In in British society but it will be we really don't know because until now he has of course been the air to the throne and been more free to speak and we heard that said earlier in the program as well that he has spoken out of turn on location and and ruffled a few feathers And he will now be in a very different position and it will be a case of the public having to get used to the style that comes with him being on the money Which means the majority of people in this country have never known anything other than And the official functions but The same myth the same ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,579,2022-09-08 18:54:30

Truly goes to London at any chance she Exactly but there's a serious economic impact here and it's also been one of the arguments about To support the monarchy Through taxes and. Go ahead. That happens Reasonably regularly here is is what the the value of the monarchy is and and the added value because there's you know even the even people like crazy who are coming to London for it there is a value in that UK as well but one that's very difficult to put a figure on They are also you know the the the crown estate is one of the biggest landlords here in London in terms of their their wealth that exist too but it's true there is that taxpayer subsidy that is something that could but it and very unlikely in the short term but it's something that could down the line Subjective debate again it is periodically in the history of the monarchy that there have been debates over how much eh the royal family should get in in money from eh from the government there are many experts that argue their excellent value for the eh for the for the country because of how much eh you know they Benefits ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,580,2022-09-08 18:59:32

Steven I wanna ask you simply about the British royal family and queen Elizabeth's kind of role not relative to the other royal families of Europe you've seen it in in Spain you've seen it in I I wanna say Italy as Having far more presidents on the continent simply because of Queen Elizabeth, they were the most in the spotlight. Does that do to the concept of royal families here in Europe? Well, it's really interesting because the transition in Monarchy's has been much greater in other parts of Europe as you mentioned after World War two many of those monkeys were dramatically scaled back not only their powers but also their role in society. I mean there's that you know that story about the the Dutch King is a trained KL Empire who flies Regularly for the National Airline. You know, I don't know if I don't know if we'll see necessarily Charles training to be able to airways while it's but you never know. Ehm this Did continuity of the queen has kept the monarchy in the state that has been for such a long time eh there may be changes on the way but remember that a lot of the change that happened elsewhere were because of events eh post world war two for example eh big constitutional changes that were happening in many in many parts of the continent as well so I wouldn't expect anything dramatic in ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,581,2022-09-08 19:03:13

Carol's still joining us from London Stephen I'm curious to hear your perspective on this How her popularity shifted really over the last 30 years exactly what we just heard from John authors. Yeah well I mean that it that whole Around the death of Princess Diana I think was a very difficult moment for the queen and and and really push a question mark over her popularity took her a long time to to move on from that but but we have seen you know towards the the at the end now of her life as we are talking about it you know the public celebration I've heard Jubilee, her platinum, Jubilee, most recently in June, if this year, there were still the street parties, there were still the people who were out You know the the slang around lunch people were referring to platty dubes the long weekend that everyone had off because of the queen and and you heard I mean potentially ironically but I think a lot of case Quite seriously. People you know talking a lot about the queen that weekend. This is the goodwill that that had been built up over her long rain despite stumbles at times like like John mentioned there Manage to maintain a place in society which I don't think Easily replicated and I don't think exists in the same form in many other places in the world It's really a lot to digest to to talk about. I mean, I I I really can't even think of another figure who would possibly be in in her category. Maybe outside of Queen Victoria, her predecessor, and the kind of maybe tough start that she had had in in in her bowl.

Again, dealing with very, very high inflation. I mean you heard it highlighted there they're certainly a danger of a worry that's after quite a long hyasis while we waited for the members of the British conservative party to elect Liz trust their new leader and then she automatically became Prime Minister Had a whole summer waiting for that to happen while this energy crisis was was hitting everybody on the on the you know coming coming through there letter box there increased bills for their energy and the US seeing it everyday in the supermarkets the rising cost of food Other things.

So I think for everybody there's a sort of personal Family remembrance that comes with it as well. And Stephanie we were just talking about this with John authors sort of the popularity of the monarchy the fact that Queen Elizabeth went through these ebbs and flows in her own popularity and you know ultimately ended her 70 years Thrown as a very very beloved figure but when you think about the future of the monarchy and the relevance of the monarchy in your view does King Charles is he able to further that or does the monarchy is relevant and popularity fade? I think I think inevitably it phase. I think it has one of the great services. You know, it was often felt that There was always jokes about Prince Charles being frustrated at his the queen to the still blocking the seat but actually I think she did him a great service Had he become king 20 years ago there was a lot of mixed feelings about him and obviously all of his divorce and feelings about Princess Diana he'd also struck many people as a slightly odd figure ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,589,2022-09-08 19:38:01

Obviously a lot of comparisons we're gonna be To the respect that his mother had for so many years here when you look both in Australia and around the world that some of the other nations that are still tethered to the UK as well as some of the allies out there that maybe were charmed by Queen Elizabeth do you think they'll also be charmed by a king Charles? Yes he does have a difficult task ahead of him and that regard him while the monarchy is hereditary becoming head of the Commonwealth is not and it was only recently that the Commonwealth Heads agreed that King Charles would be ahead of the Commonwealth going forward so you're quite right he doesn't command the same respect that his mother It's 73 years old he's served the longest apprenticeship in history when it comes to the seating to the throne so we're going to have to wait and see I really hate to use those words when I'm reporting but that is literally what we will do to see what the reign of King Charles the third is and yeah whether he can command the same respect among Writtens form a colonies.

We have huge companies that grew out of that and still today, there's new ideas, new things being built. The thing about a mica ravi environment is it's limitless. It's like the data we have access to on the internet. It is limitless. And it is not immediately obvious to us. All the benefits that that's gonna entail. But over time it will become very very obvious By 2024 action plans to send a central node to attach to the ISS. That will make up the core of their new station This will be followed by crew quarters for 16 people and research in manufacturing modules When the ISS is retired this will break away an additional modules with a lifespan of 30 years will be added and swapped out as they age using a robotic arm Hoping to do all of this for one 50th the cost of the ISS.

It's almost like Armstrong put that first boot on the moon. This will be the first time that we've gone from a platform of learning how to live in space, to building our permanent home and space. Another private companies also want to use the ISS as the starting point for their own ventures. Aerospace already has one of its inflatable structures attached to the station and others including Sierra Nevada and Nanarax have put forward proposals Space habitats are expensive. I think it's a fall steak economy to say, okay, we're done with the international space station. Let's move on to commercial platforms. What I think is much more likely and realistic in what Nasa is certainly driving toward is an incremental transition where commercial platforms attached to the space station Collaboratively with the space station the next chapter of cannot occur Active engagement of companies That active engagement might not be as customers might not be as drivers it might be in service of government mission objectives we will return American astronauts to the moon not only to leave behind footprints and flags but to build the foundation we need to send Americans Mars and Beyond. This proposed mission along with SpaceX's own ambition to reach a red planet has opened up a longer term market and some companies are already thinking beyond orbiting habitats like space stations to actually building on a surface of other planets.

There's no such thing as brute force when it comes to space like you need to think about the problem Find a very elegant lightweight cost effective The next challenge is really going to places on earth literally taking the dirt that we're finding on a site and beginning to print with the dirt We have to perfect this technology on earth And then we go prove it out on the moon And then finally on to Mars. The first customers could include NASA and companies like SpaceX who would lease out these structures for individual missions but before that AI space factory hope their technology could be monetized as well as transformational here on earth Build more sustainably so rather than building with steel and concrete which are these manufacturer very energy intensive materials to go to a site have a solar powered array that within a lower threeD printer to print in the most Way possible.

Stage the place hold an open house every single weekend and hope that the right buyer walks through that door Ago you could probably go look at a house and circle back 2 to 3 weeks later and still have an opportunity to make a bid.
