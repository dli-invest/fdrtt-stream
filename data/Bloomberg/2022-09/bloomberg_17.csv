The way we've been strong armed, the way we've been coerced. Unionization in some sports Fights over free agency in baseball In boxing the Muhammad Aliac which restricts the kinds of contract terms that can be imposed on boxers. The fighters who brought this lawsuit see it as the continuation of a tradition in sports of athletes fighting to have agency and power in the terms of their work And who they do it for. Martial arts used to be pretty culturally and legally fringe in the United States. It was banned by most states John McCain had famously called it human cock fighting There are some rules in the UFC but to a large extent all sorts of body parts and tactics and attacks are on the table and people get Injured at times.

9304,Take care of you. The fighters would say at the heart of UFC's Is the contract that it signs with fighters. Before boxing had competition boxing used to be dominated by a few dominant promoters and the contracts were quartered over from boxing and the contracts are basically designed to control every aspect of a fighter's career. There are long term. They last multiple fights. Fighters under these contracts Are bound to fight only for UFC for a period of time. And UFC can extend that time if a fighter declines a match or if a fighter gets injured Take control who the fighter fights they control when the fighter fights and then they have a number of different classes that make it very difficult for a fighter to ever break free from the UFC if that fighter ever did want to become a free agent So one sided there really is no negotiation room for any of the things especially as you're coming up and as they're strangle hold on the sporter MMA got so much stronger. Part of what's at the heart of this lawsuit is the ways that UFC Off the board. The UFC has such a strangle hold on mixed martial arts and as they were buying up so much of the competition shutting them all down. They really became the the only option for anybody that wanted to do this professionally.

We the fighters make this whole thing happen. Driven by broccoli By all the greats that have watched before us and that walked this path right now. We are the product. If the fighters are not the product, then go ahead and release us from our contracts. You'll do fine without us. Clearly.

Multibe mapping works by using Sonars so Sonar is taking sound and the measurement of time so you have a multibean sewnar and it sends out a ping of sound that sound travels to the water column hits the sea floor and comes back to the ship and we measure that time and we're able to calculate the distance ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3083,2022-09-16 00:23:23

There's similarities in the feed that we give cows and takes and chickens but there's also differences how we cultivate and it's Similar for us as well. So we've been working with the FDA and the USDF for the last 3 years and really developing the guidelines on how this food should be regulated when we come to the market as soon as we get regularly approval in the United States.

They'll be able to go to a restaurant near them and order meat directly from animal cell But it's not just getting the meat right once approved the gates open to a very high potential demand and scaling becomes the next big hurdle The second is we need to reduce a cost of the nutrients that these cells are consuming so then chicken feed raises or drop Hey, some chicken. The nutrients we feed ourselves does the same things. We need to drive that down. The cell density is another technical element. We need to continue to to increase that and hammering on those things of the course in the next 510, 15 years, we'll put us in a place where we're significantly below the cost of this animal protein and that will be one of the main inflection Points that will will lead to a new way of eating meat.

What was intended as Shuenard's philosophical handbook for employees became an international blueprint for sustainable business printed in 10 languages What's interesting to me is that all this I hate the term on brand but it's very on brand it really works for the kind of company he's created it works for the kind of employees he's been able to recruit and retain it all it is very seamless in terms of the identity Of him and the company and and what it means So over time the company's mission Marketing have become the same thing.

But this was still small change compared to fast fashion heavy weights like Nike who made 37 1 billion dollars that same year Patagonia's conscience hasn't always been reflected in its customer base either. Personalized bests have become the go to corporate uniform. Expensive price tag has helped the brand and the nickname Patagucci. It's expensive stuff. It's expensive apparel and that is part of their calculus in terms of the activism, you know, a lot of the more sustainable parts of this supply chain are there. There's a premium for organic cotton or sustainable down. We've had a Gucci label is is a symptom of that. So, Are very popular of course with people who are active in the outdoors but also with people who are not as active.

Things of the run success. Patagonia set sales records in the first 3 years of the Trump administration. Now, in 2020, things have changed. Is COVID-19 brought the business well to a halt and the American people voted in a new administration? Patagonia appointed brian gallet as CEO.

We're thinking of probably a three, two, work week, but we think coming together is just such a core part of innovation, serendipity, culture, every element of it. And we're growing at a really rapid clip We are excited to be expanding our real estate footprint and then we also wanted to make sure that we're needing people where they wanna be and so enlarging the number of sites that we have available for people in particular sites where you have great diverse populations. Soon, I just told me that googlers will have this option to work in a hybrid mode. Forever. Literally forever. You're embracing this massive cultural shift but what are the risks you know what are you worry about So the positive we've seen is there's a productivity uplift we believe in giving people the opportunity to be at home some of the time not do the commute be able to deal with everything else in their life and coming into the office so the risk is I think My career and so much of the benefit in my We need to make sure that we're thinking about this hybrid work life and why that's the way to be the best magnet for talent ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp8PhLsUcFE,3107,2022-09-16 02:07:30

They go together and and you have to think of them as actually empowering one another. The treasury department during the great recession what lessons did you take away from that what struck me is a lot of the lessons from the financial crisis are relevant in good times and bad times so the most important is it's easier to prevent than to fix and and so you know there was that was really clear during the financial crisis the financial crisis was about Liquidity and it dried up quickly and it would have been really easy 6 to 12 months prior to build in durable equity you couldn't do it in the moment and so this notion about really building a solid foundation on which you You need to do that ahead of time. It needs to be all of the work we do on trust and safety and content moderation, security, that is the foundation on which you can build everything else.

It's really important for those of us Certain leadership positions to be very focused on constructively engaging and working with regulators on what are the issues what is it they're trying to solve and how can we constructively engage with them at the same time our engineers should focus on innovation and continuing to kind of up the bar and everything we're doing address what is most helpful for our users Is facing more serious legal threats at this time in the United States than the other big tech companies.
